dig-alignment
=============

Code to do feature alignment in DIG where we map data extracted from sources (mostly Web pages) to JSON files structured accourding to our DIG ontology.

## datasets
Contains small and tiny datasets for testing. Tiny datasets are for giving people an idea of what's in the data. small datasets are about 1M compressed so that GitHub works at a reasonable speed.

## karma
The home directory of karma so that others can easily replicate the Karma environment on their machines. The interesting files are in the preloaded-ontologies

##models
The Karma models to map datasets to the ontology

##aligned-datasets
JSON datasets that have been aligned and merged according to the DIG ontology.
