1. The code in karma/python/market.py is intended to export a function getSourceMarketUri(ad_uri, ad_title, ad_city, ad_state)
which provides a uri of the form http://dig.isi.edu/sourcemarket/...
This uri is intended to uniquely model the combination of a source
(e.g.,) and a location designator within that source.

e.g. "http://dig.isi.edu/sourcemarket/backpage/columbusga", 

This is supposed to mean backpage.com's idea of what 'columbusga' means

2. The data source sitekeymappings.json can be used to translate from the sourcemarket uri to a market uri of the form

e.g. "market_uri": "http://dig.isi.edu/market/CSG"

This is supposed to mean "Andrew's registered/correlated
source-independent location associated with the designator 'CSG'"
These are generally named after the FAA/ICAO code for the nearest
airport to the associated city or region

3. The data source market_info can be used to translate from the the
market_uri to attributes about that market.  Most notably, a single
designator city which can be used to geolocate

e.g.,

{
    "adm1_name": "Georgia", 
    "airport_data_provenance": "datahub.io/dataset/open-flights", 
    "airport_elevation": 397, 
    "airport_latitude": 32.5163333, 
    "airport_longitude": -84.9388611, 
    "airport_name": "Columbus Metropolitan Airport", 
    "city_name": "Columbus", 
    "country_name": "United States", 
    "faa_icao_code": "CSG", 
    "sort_index": 5150, 
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
}

is all the information I have right now about Columbus, Georgia, USA

4. TBD. Later on I will project another source or another field which
will include all names referred to for a given market.  Its entries
will look like:

{
  "faa_icao_code": "SFO":
  "designators": ["san francisco", "sf", "sfo", "bay area"]
  }
