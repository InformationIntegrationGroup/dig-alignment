 {"abstract":"Ion implantation provides a mechanism for radically modifying the electronic and transport properties of a variety of polymers that are normally insulating. By using masks and tailoring the implanted species and ion energies, conducting paths in an insulating medium can be fabricated between specific reference points, an application of obvious relevance to the microelectronics industry. Specific results are reported for modification of the structure, electrical conductivity, thermoelectric-power, optical transmission and electron spin resonance for several polymers under a variety of implantation conditions. The temperature and frequency dependence of the conductivity suggest a onedimensional variable range hopping mechanism for conduction along the polymer chains. Comparison is made between implantation in the 200 keV and 2 MeV energy ranges.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"The reactivity of several fluorine-containing molecules on a polycrystalline silicon nitride (Si3N4) surface is studied under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The chemistry of fluorine on Si3N4 is of interest in understanding the high temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of Si3N4, which uses SiF4 as a starting material. XeF2 is reacted with a Si3N4 surface to prepare and characterize various surface SiFx (1 ≤ × ≤ 3) species. These are identified by the chemical shift induced by the fluorine atoms in the Si (LMM) Auger peak and by changes in the TPD. Of these species, SiF2 is stable to the highest temperature. SiF2 is also formed by the reaction of SiF4 with a Si3N4. Because SiF2 is so stable, its decomposition is proposed as a rate-determining step in the CVD deposition of Si3N4 from SiF4. Gaseous HF, which is a product of the CVD process, does not dissociate on Si3N4 and is therefore unlikely to cause the etch-like marks on the Si3N4 coating that are observed under certain conditions.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) are becoming increasingly important for highspeed electronic applications. This paper will discuss how the unique growth chemistry of metalorganic molecular beam epitaxy (MOMBE) can be used to produce high performance HBTs. For example, it has been well documented that MOMBE's ability to grow heavily doped, well-confined layers of either n- or p-type is a significant advantage for this device. This feature arises primarily from the ability to use gaseous dopant sources in the absence of interfacial gas boundary layers. While this is an advantage for doping, it can be a disadvantage in other areas such as AlGaAs purity or InGaP lattice matching. This paper will discuss how these difficulties can be overcome through the use of novel Al or Ga precursors thus allowing deposition of high quality GaAs-based HBTs. By using trimethylamine alane (TMAA), background impurity concentrations can be reduced substantially. Further improvements in purity require cleaner Ga precursors or alternatively novel Ga substitutes. The resulting reduction in compensation allows for the use of lower dopant concentrations in the AlGaAs thus producing significant improvement in the leakage behavior of the base-emitter junction. Even further improvement can be achieved through the use of InGaP. Using novel Ga precursors, such as tri-isobutylgallium (TIBG), the problems associated with the sensitivity of composition to growth temperature are greatly reduced, allowing for the reproducible deposition of devices containing InGaP emitter layers.","chemistry_names":   [

The average diameter of the as-spun fibers decreased into nanometer scale with decreasing the concentration of PVP. Addition of a volatile organic salt (pyridinium formate, PF) or utilization of three-mixed solvent system was also effective to reduce the size of the diameter of as-spun fibers. After the removal of PVP from as-spun fibers by Soxhlet extraction, pure MEH-PPV fibers were obtained as a ribbon-like structure aligned with wrinkled surface in fiber direction. As-spun fibers showed relatively higher crystallinity, higher conjugation length, and a remarkable blue shift of photoluminescence (PL) peak was observed, in comparison with the cast film. The increase in composition of MEH-PPV and the removal of PVP from as-spun MEH-PPV/PVP fibers resulted in a significant blue-shift in UV-Vis absorption peak and red-shift in PL peak.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"The performance of Zircaloy nuclear fuel cladding in the environment of the proposed Yucca Mountain (YM) high-level waste (HLW) repository is evaluated. Because the uniform aqueous corrosion/oxidation rate is extremely slow, this evaluation focuses on mechanical failure, localized corrosion, stress corrosion cracking (SCC), hydrogen embrittlement, and initial failure. Mechanical failure is expected to result from (1) disruptive events such as rockfalls from seismicity, faulting, and igneous activities, (2) creep, and (3) splitting by oxidation of the spent fuel (SF) matrix. Effects of chloride ions and radiolysis are evaluated in localized corrosion and SCC. Embrittlement can be caused by delayed-hydride cracking (DHC) and hydride reorientation. Among these cladding failure modes, rockfalls, other disruptive events and initial defects can be important to performance prior to the container failure by corrosion. Confirmatory tests are required to evaluate the susceptibility to splitting by secondary mineral formation, localized corrosion, SCC, and hydride reorientation. Reliable temperature calculations with backfilling are also required. After breach, cladding may still assure slow release of radionuclides through perforations because localized failures may limit the exposure of the SF matrix and may provide high mass-transfer resistance. Failures prior to the repository emplacement arising from reactor operation, pool storage, dry storage, and transportation are also considered.","chemistry_names":   [

A maximum selectivity of 10.9 to 1 for a 1000:1 HF:H2O dilution at 70 °C is observed. Wafers are etched in hot, dilute HF and cleaned using standard techniques [1]. A thin (12 nm) oxide is then grown and dielectric properties are measured to determine optimum process conditions. For very dilute solutions at lower temperatures, relatively low dielectric strengths (5-6 MV/cm) for the grown oxide are observed, which indicates roughening of the silicon surface. Although the parameter space for exploiting the selective etch process is constrained, a significant range of process conditions exist where selectivity is present and no electrical properties are degraded.","chemistry_names":   [

A comparison with relaxed a-Si suggests that damage generation in a-Si:H merely arises from displacements in the silicon network. Annealing of ion-damaged a-Si:H at 200-500 °C recovers the carrier lifetime to 60-100 ps as a result of hydrogen passivation of electrical defects.

This is in contrast to the expected behavior of a homogeneous, conducting film. This observation shows that even at temperatures significantly above the transition temperature, the formation of a homogeneous, conducting film is incomplete. We demonstrate that effective-medium theory (EMT) in combination with a Drude model accounting for the conductivity of metallic domains formed in the VO2 film accounts for all our observations.

Many of the programmable techniques do not require high temperatures, so they can be used to make fine-scale structures of organic and bio-materials, and even live biologicals. Quantitative comparisons of both additive and subtractive programmable methods show that only a few, based on electron or ion beams, or on proximal probes, are capable of making nanometer-scale structures. Assembly methods, notably self- and directed-assembly, should prove to be central to the realization of manufacturable nanotechnology.

A digital image-based model was developed to describe the electrical conduction process in polycrystalline mono- or multi-phase materials. The microstructure of each polycrystalline sample was reconstructed using the Voronoi tessellation technique (in fact, ad hoc modifications with respect to the original algorithm were introduced) and it was then converted into a threedimensional electrical network according to a set of well-defined rules. The network was solved via an iterative procedure for different frequency values and successively the Nyquist plot generated The complex impedance spectra of different composites were simulated considering the alumina content (5,10 and 15 %wt) as a parameter; both the bulk and grain boundary electrical conductivity were calculated and the Arrhenius plots obtained.

To understand and quantify these effects it is necessary to calculate the interaction between dopant and domain wall. In the following the dopant ion is modelled as an elastic dipole. The stresses surrounding a 180° domain wall are calculated in analogy to calculations in the magnetic case for Bloch walls. It is assumed that electrostrictive effects control the strains and that the spontaneous polarization does not rotate but decreases to zero at the center of the domain wall and increases in the opposite direction on the other side of the domain wall. The calculations are made assumingisotropic elastic constants. It is found that only elastic dipoles oriented in the planeof the domain wall interact with it. The interaction forces as a function of perpendicular distance between wall and dipole show an antisymmetric characteristic.","chemistry_names":   [

A previously unreported relationship between the interatomic bonding involving these impurities and the electronic transport properties of the films is discussed in this paper. The bonding studies were carried out principally using Auger lineshape analysis. Transport properties measured included 4-terminal resistivities, Hall mobilities and carrier concentrations, and Seebeck coefficients.

 {"abstract":"We have shown recently that the temperature dependence of the phototransport properties can yield information regarding the state distribution in the forbidden gap of semiconductors. Of these properties the light intensity exponents of both, the majority carriers, γe, and the minority carriers, γh, were found to be very sensitive to the details of this distribution. In particular, noting that sub 1/2 values of the exponents are very unusual we have studied their origin in some a-Si:H materials. Finding experimentally such sub 1/2 values of γh and running computer simulations of the recombination processes in a-Si:H led us to the conclusion that these low values are due to acceptor-like centers which have a relatively high capture coefficient for the holes. We attribute these centers to the unintentional oxygen doping in a-Si:H. We will show that the oxygen presence, usually ignored in the discussions of the phototransport properties of a-Si:H, appears to be, in many cases, the dominant factor in the properties of \u201cintrinsic\u201d a-Si:H.","chemistry_names":   [

The unique features of the fiber twist test include the absence of Poisson effects during testing. This eliminates the nonlinear variation, with changing embedded fiber lengths, of fracture modes and accompanying debond energy, and of friction along the interface. Since the fiber is not removed from its surrounding matrix during testing, the interface area remains constant.

 {"abstract":"In this paper we review field data from failures related to materials and devices that are the building blocks of optically amplified dense-wavelength division multiplexed (DWDM) transmission systems. A DWDM transmission system consists of at least three distinct components: an optical multiplexer, one or more optical fiber amplifiers (OFAs), and an optical demultiplexer. A tandem arrangement of these components performs the function currently up to 40 independent high speed optical communications channels (about 2 million phone calls) over a single fiber link. Of these components, OFAs are considered the workhorse of this new technology, and, as with any new technology, their reliability is the focus of considerable attention. Commercially available OFAs are erbium-doped silica or fluoride fibers that operate in the 1550 nm optical communication window. Such OFAs consist of an active Er-doped fiber and pump laser(s) that collectively are referred to as the gain module, passive optical components used for routing, and electronic components for monitoring and operational support. We present the result of the failure analysis for each part as well as their role in the failure of the OFA. Using the data from systems deployed in the field, we summarize the history of failures of OFAs and other components and discuss their impact on the reliability of the DWDM system as a whole. From a material, packaging and system integration point of view, we address the reliability merits of different designs that, by and large, perform the same overall function. Finally, we shall outline how network providers that deploy such DWDM systems would benefit from a manufacturing strategy that incorporates reliability in its initial steps starting with the materials and packaging needs.","chemistry_names":   [

The pre-deposition oxidation creates approximately 0.5nm of SiO2, and produces an SiO2/Si interface with a midgap trap density of ∼1.3×1010cm−2eV−1. The MOS capacitors prepared by this technique have properties comparable to those with thermal oxides grown at 850\u20131050°C.

 {"abstract":"Focused ion beam (FIB) milling coupled with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on the same platform enables 3D microstructural analysis of structures using FIB for serial sectioning and SEM for imaging. Since FIB milling is a destructive technique, the acquisition of multiple signals from each slice is desirable. The feasibility of collecting both an inlens backscattered electron (BSE) signal and an inlens secondary electron (SE) simultaneously from a single scan of the electron beam from each FIB slice is demonstrated. The simultaneous acquisition of two different SE signals from two different detectors (inlens vs. Everhart-Thornley (ET) detector) is also possible. Obtaining multiple signals from each FIB slice with one scan increases the acquisition throughput. In addition, optimization of microstructural and morphological information from the target is achieved using multi-signals. Examples of multi-signal FIB/SEM tomography from a dental implant will be provided where both material contrast from the bone/ceramic coating/Ti substrate phases and porosity in the ceramic coating will be characterized.","chemistry_names":   [

Actually these are typically mixed-valence compounds and the terminology of \u2018dioxide\u2019 is not appropriate. The mechanisms for their variety of chemical reactivities are still open for study. On the cation uptake mechanism there are strong claims that a redox process is involved in cation uptakes by manganic acids synthesized by substituting H+ for alkali cations incorporated in \u2018hydrous manganese dioxides\u2019. The present work was carried out to physically demonstrate the alkali cation exchange mechanism on tunnel-structured manganic acids and to study the ion exchange with lattice vibrational spectroscopy. Manganic acids were prepared through the redox process using KMnO4 and MnSO4, and thermal decomposition of (CH3)3COK and MnCO3 at 530°C. ESCA spectra of their alkali cation exchanged forms indicated no evidence of redox process and supported the ion exchange mechanism on these materials. Their infrared absorption spectra strongly depended on their preparation routes and are closely related to their ion-exchange selectivity of each material. Thus, the vibrational spectra of manganic acids take an important role as a synthesis index together with XRD patterns.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"A robust processing route at low cost is an essential requirement for high-temperature materials used in automotive engines. Because of their excellent high-temperature properties, their low density, high elastic modulus as well as high specific strength, intermetallic γ-TiAl based alloys are potential candidates for application in advanced automotive turbochargers. So-called 3rd generation alloys, such as TNM™ alloys with a nominal composition of Ti-43.5Al-4Nb-1Mo-0.1B (in at%), are multi-phase alloys consisting of γ-TiAl, α2-Ti3Al and a low volume fraction of βo-TiAl phase. In this paper a novel hot-processing route, which is a combination of a one-shot hot-forging step and a controlled cooling treatment, leads to mechanical properties required for turbocharger turbine wheels. The observed strength can be attributed to the small lamellar spacing within the α2/γ colonies of the nearly lamellar microstructure. In order to analyze the microstructure and the prevailing phase fractions microscopic examinations and X-ray diffraction measurements were conducted. The mechanical properties were determined by hardness measurements as well as tensile and creep tests. The evolution of the microstructure during the hot-forming process is described and its relation to the obtained mechanical properties.","chemistry_names":   [

The results indicate variations in intrinsic stress from ∼0.5GPa compressive to mildly tensile (∼50 MPa). Microstructure is characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD). The evolution of intrinsic stress with temperature is investigated by thermally cycling YSZ films deposited on silicon wafers. Observed changes of 100s of MPa in the intrinsic stress component of the film serve as indicators of possible changes in microstructure. Such changes in microstructure are subsequently characterized using x-ray diffraction of as-deposited and annealed films.

 {"abstract":"Many crystalline ceramics can be topologically disordered (amorphized) by disordering radiation events involving high-energy collision cascades or (in some cases) successive single-atom displacements. We are interested in both the potential for disorder and the possible aperiodic structures adopted following the disordering event. The potential for disordering is related to connectivity, and among those structures of interest are tetrahedral networks (such as SiO2, SiC and Si3N4) comprising corner-shared tetrahedral units whose connectivities are easily evaluated. In order to study the response of these networks to radiation, we have chosen to model their assembly according to the (simple) local rules that each corner obeys in connecting to another tetrahedron; in this way we easily erect large computer models of any crystalline polymorphic form. Amorphous structures can be similarly grown by application of altered rules. We have adopted a simple model of irradiation in which all bonds in the neighborhood of a designated tetrahedron are destroyed, and we reform the bonds in this region according to a set of (possibly different) local rules appropriate to the environmental conditions. When a tetrahedron approaches the boundary of this neighborhood, it undergoes an optimization step in which a spring is inserted between two corners of compatible tetrahedra when they are within a certain distance of one another; component forces are then applied that act to minimize the distance between these corners and minimize the deviation from the rules. The resulting structure is then analyzed for the complete adjacency matrix, irreducible ring statistics, and bond angle distributions.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"The utility of superelastic Ni-Ti alloys in the medical industry has been rather dramatically demonstrated in recent years. A great number of devices are now in production, and still others are staged to enter production during the next few years. This surge in interest from the medical community stems from an increased acceptance of Ni-Ti because of its biocompatibility, advances in micromachining techniques and trends towards less-invasive surgical techniques. In addition, there are a variety of new developmental concepts that will have a major influence on this and other markets during the next 5 years of commercialization. This review will highlight many of the properties of Ni-Ti by illustration in a variety of recent medical applications, and then discuss some of the newer developmental concepts. Medical applications that will be presented here include guidewires, laparoscopic surgical instruments, implants, stents, retrieval baskets, and bone anchors. Some of the new concepts and capabilities that are reviewed include microvalves made from thin films, high temperature alloys, fatigue resistant composites, and robotic actuators with tactile feedback.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Multiple interaction computer simulations have been used to determine the properties of collision cascades in liquid In targets induced by normally incident 5 keV Ar+ ions. Below the first atomic layer the cascade becomes Thompson-like relatively quickly. However, within the first atomic layer the angular distribution of moving atoms became forward peaked by 150 fs and remained so until,∼300 fs. Energy and angle resolved (EARN) spectra were calculated for the ejected atoms. The peak of the energy distribution shifted to lower energies at larger ejection angles, and the angular distributions became broader for lower energy particles. Both results agree with recent experimental data, and with a simple model proposed bg Garrison.

 {"abstract":"The growth and energetics of Ga chains on a Si(112) facet surface have been investigated. Low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Reflectance Difference Anisotropy (RDA) experiments have been performed in UHV to examine the kinetics of the Ga atom chain formation process along the Si steps. This is a self-limiting process for substrate temperatures in the 400°C to 500°C range, since the binding energy of the metal atoms at the step edges is greater than that on the (11l)-type terraces. At saturation coverage, the Ga chains exhibit sixfold periodicity along the step edges, but below saturation, these chains exhibit fivefold periodicity. A model has been suggested from these results in which the periodicities of the chains are determined by the metal atom vacancies, which balance the tensile stress created by the larger metal atoms. We have used RDA to study the time evolution of the surface kinetics and changes in the surface reconstruction of Ga deposited on these facet (112) Si surfaces, as a function of substrate temperature and Ga deposition rate. The RDA measurement is shown to be sensitive to the formation of both the 5×1 as well as 6 × 1 reconstructions and to island formation at low substrate temperatures. The diffusion-controlled Ga line formation process at low temperatures has also been characterized as well as the evaporation controlled regime, which is evident at substrate temperatures over 400°C.","chemistry_names":   [

Also, cell spreading is related to filopodia extension which has been shown to be dependent on substrate topography. To better understand this correlation, live-cell imaging was used here to investigate osteoblast (bone forming cell) filopodia extension and cell spreading on two different kinds of diamond. Nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) and submicron crystalline diamond (SMCD) were fabricated to possess similar surface chemistry but different topographies, consisting of nanoscale spherical grains in NCD and submicron polyhedral grains in SMCD. The filopodia extension and cell expansion results showed that cells on nanoscale topographies had faster filopodia extension and greater expansion area than on submicron topographies. Results indicated that substrate topography has an impact on cell filopodia extension and cell spreading, and NCD promoted filopodia extension and cell expansion better than SMCD.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"We have investigated enhancement of diamond nucleation due to electrode biasing and compared these results with those obtained using substrate biasing. The electrode biasing results in near-surface dc glow discharge with characteristic negative glows and dark regions on both sides of the electrode (cathode). We have studied systematically diamond nucleation density as a function of substrate location with respect to the electrode and gas pressure. Using scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, we have determined that a significant enhancement up to 109 cm-2 in diamond nucleation is achieved when the substrate is located in the negative glow region of the near-surface dc glow discharge. It is also found that gas pressure enhances nucleation site density but the quality of diamond decreases. The optimization of these parameters in obtaining high-quality diamond films is discussed.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Rare-earth-substituted tetragonal lead zirconate titanate thin films were synthesized for improving the ferroelectric property of conventional lead zirconate titanate. Thin films of Pb1.00REx (Zr0.40Ti0.60)1-(3x /4)O3 (x = 0.02, RE = Y, Dy, Er and Yb) were deposited on (111)Pt/Ti/SiO2/(100)Si substrates by a chemical solution deposition (CSD). B-site substitution using rare-earth cations described above enhanced the crystal anisotropy, i.e., ratio of PZT lattice parameters c/a. Remanent polarization (P r) of PZT film was enhanced by Y3+-, Dy3+- and Er3+-substitution from 20 μC/cm2 up to 26, 25 and 26 μC/cm2 respectively, while ion substitution using Yb3+ degraded the Pr value down to 16 μC/cm2. These films had similar coercive fields (E c) of around 100 kV/cm. Improving the ferroelectric property of PZT film by rare-earth-substitution would be ascribed to the enhancement of the crystal anisotropy. We concluded that ion substitution using some rare-earth cations, such as Y3+, Dy3+ or Er3+, is one of promising technique for improving the ferroelectric property of PZT film.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Scanning force microscopy is used to study the structure of various sensing films after chemical and thermal treatments. An example chemical modification of the sensing film can be achieved by heating a Pt/Ti sensing film in an oxygen environment. 1 With Pt acting as a catalyst, the Ti can become partially oxidized, resulting in a Pt/TiOx film which has different electronic properties than a metallic film. By further oxidizing the film, an insulating layer of TiO2 may be achieved. Or as in the case of hydrogen sensing, the Pt/TiOx film may revert to a more metallic state via the reduction of TiOx. The chemical interactions of these sensing films may be associated with large scale microstructural changes. The sensing activity and the structure of Ti, Pt/Ti, and Au/Ti films to gases such as hydrogen, and propylene has been studied. These chemical and morphological changes can be monitored by measuring the resistance of the thin sensing films. Pt/Ti films were found to have the best response to hydrogen (200 ppm) and propylene (150 ppm), while Au/Ti films showed weaker response to propylene (500 ppm) and CO (1000 ppm). The Pt/Ti films also showed shifts in temperature with changing propylene concentration possibly due to catalytic combustion.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"The rate of many processes, including the diffusion of water into rhyolitic volcanic glass (obsidian), as well as the racemization of amino acids is temperature dependent, and a knowledge of temperatures integrated over time periods of at least a year is necessary to quantify these processes. The construction and properties of simple devices consisting of small plastic containers that change weight at a rate that is a function of temperature and the activity of water will be described. The cells function because water diffuses through the plastic across a constant vapor-pressure gradient. This vapor-pressure gradient is maintained constant between the substances within the cell and the materials outside the cell. The plastic cells are usually filled with water and surrounded by a dehydrating agent, such as silica gel. A better arrangement is to fill the cell with a mixture of solid sodium chloride (NaCl) and a saturated solution of NaCl, and to surround the cell with pure water. A number of plastics have been investigated, including polycarbonate, polystyrene, tefzel, polyallomer, and methacrylate. The cells have been sealed by various methods including screw caps, room-temperature vulcanizingsilicone rubber sealant, and rubber stoppers. The final design consists of a small cell made of a polycarbonate plastic centrifuge tube containing solid NaCl plus NaCl-saturated solution sealed with a rubber stopper and placed in a polypropylene tube containing pure water. Our aim has been to develop cells that are sufficiently sensitive to yield a precision of ±0.2° C when exposed for one year at temperatures that range from 0° to 40°, and that will fit into metal fittings that can be screwed into standard 3/4-inch plastic water pipe (approximately 1 inch outside diameter).","chemistry_names":   [

SEM images and FTIR spectra of the resulting mineral show that by altering the amount of gelatin in the growth solutions the final organic component can be controlled accurately in the range of 1-10%, similar to that of natural eggshell.

 {"abstract":"Discrete element method (DEM) is one of the excellent procedures for model simulation of behavior of granular assemblies. A two-dimensional DEM simulation of powder compaction by a complex mold was conducted by considering the deformation behavior of individual particles measured by a compression test of free particles. Spherical copper particles were used as a model material in this study. The particles (particle size ranges from 38 to 125microns) were individually compressed between parallel platens to measure compressive load and displacement in the loading direction. From the measured load and displacement data, force-displacement relations at contacts between the particles, and between the particles and mold wall were determined. In the simulation, the two-dimensional complex mold consisting of three stages (upper stage:3-mm wide and 1-mm deep, middle stage:2-mm wide and 1-mm deep, lower stage:1-mm wide and 1-mm deep) was charged with the copper powder consisting of spherical particles with size range of 50 to 200microns and was pressed under four press conditions. Forces at all contacts were calculated by using the determined force-displacement relations and each particle's position was traced by solving equations of motion for each particle. Pressure at each wall of the mold and density distribution in the powder compact were calculated as results of the simulation. It was found that the increase in the pressure at each wall corresponds to the increase in the density of the powder near the wall.","chemistry_names":   [

We tried to bring solution chemistry, composition spread libraries and a very high sample density together within one approach and tested inkjet printing of materials libraries using sol-gel recipes as synthesis method. Inkjet printing allows the deposition of liquid volumes in the pL range thus enabling the deposition of very small catalyst amounts. For the application of this technique in sol-gel chemistry several restrictions have to be handled, such as viscosity limitations of the printing head. Parameters as solvent, solvent amount, metal precursors, metal salt concentrations, deposition sequences etc. as well as gelification procedures have to be optimized. Catalytic screening relies on porous samples with high surface area to get conversions, which can be detected by HT screening methods.

 {"abstract":"The optical emission spectra resulting from ion beam sputtering a SrTiO3 target were observed as a function of position. A collimated optical fiber bundle parallel to the plane of die sputter target was translated vertically and horizontally to spectroscopically profile the sputter process. Three different angles of incidence of the beam to die target were examined for evidence of bombardment of candidate substrate positions by undesirable species. When the ion beam was at normal incidence to the target or 22.5* from normal incidence the Ar and O contours were of similar shape. However, when die target was inclined at an angle of 45* to die incident ion beam die O contours deviated markedly. Under these conditions it appears that there is a substantial oxygen flux in a direction normal to die target surface. Under these conditions die placement of a substrate facing die sputter target would probably result in undesirable bombardment of die growing film by energetic oxygen.","chemistry_names":   [

The resulting ingots were examined metallographically for evidence of grain refinement, and three-point bend tests were conducted on samples to assess the effect on room-temperature ductility. Ductility was assumed to correlate with the strain corresponding to the maximum stress obtained in the bend test. The results showed that titanium was extremely effective in grain refinement, although it severely embrittled the alloy in contents exceeding 1%.

Atomic hydrogen is also found to passivate a variety of other species in GaN, as detected by a change in the electrical or optical properties of the material. An example is the increase in luminescence efficiency of Er3+ ions in AIN after hydrogenation, through passivation of non-radiative states that would be an alternative path for de-excitation. The injection of hydrogen during a large variety of device fabrication steps has been detected by SIMS profiling using 2H isotopic labeling.

 {"abstract":"The Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 ferroelectric gate was successfully integrated into the GaN/AlGaN heterostructure with 2D electron gas. The processing conditions were optimized in a way to obtain high quality textured Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 films without destroying the 2D gas situated as close to the interface as 20nm. Study of transport properties in this system demonstrates a possibility to control the 2D gas by switching the spontaneous polarization in the gate. Concentration and mobility of electrons in the 2D gas were monitored using Hall effect and resistivity measurements in a wide temperature range from 4.2K to 300K. The polarization oriented in the direction \u201cfrom bottom to top\u201d provokes a partial depletion effect in the channel resulting in a conductivity decrease. A correlation between the depletion effect in 2D gas and the change of the spontaneous polarization with temperature has been observed. The depletion effect is found to be reversible so that the initial conductivity in 2D gas can be restored by inversing the spontaneous polarization in the gate. These results suggest that ferroelectric gates integrated into systems with 2D electron gas may be potentially interesting for a number of experiments and applications as a flexible and nondestructive way of making rewritable nanopatterns on semiconductor heterostructures.","chemistry_names":   [

The IV-characteristics of solar cells with window layer thickness of d1=200nm exhibit a strong enhancement of the short-circuit current density JSC (ΔJSC = 3mA/cm2) as compared to samples with module-like ZnO:Al-film thickness (d2=1200nm). Accordingly, the quantum efficiency reveals the spectral regimes where the JSC-gain occurs. Moreover, current-voltage measurements reveal that the cells with thicker ZnO:Al exhibit slightly decreased open circuit voltage VOC. This finding can be assigned to a decreased net-doping density NA, which appears to be introduced by additional heat flux during the longer process time required for deposition of thicker ZnO:Al films. However, the improved efficiency of solar cells with thinner window layer comes along with an increase of the series resistance (RS) by almost a factor of 2, which will have consequences for the series connection of elements in a module. XRD-diffractograms and SEM cross-section imaging suggest that the enhanced RS in cells with thin ZnO:Al is not exclusively related to the thickness but is also due to a reduced (002)-texture and an elongated lateral charge carrier pathway.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Dichlorosilane based CVD WSix is deposited by the reaction of tungsten fluoride (WF6) and dichlorosilane (SiH2Cl2; DCS). The reaction is thermodynamically favorable and results in WSix film with less fluorine (F) concentration than monosilane (SiH4; MS) based WSix. DCS based WSix shows less expansion of gate oxide and better step coverage than monosilane based WSix. Due to its DCS based stable film stoichiometry, WSix has low resistivity and therefore has been widely applied in ULSI memory devices. However, DCS is a source of chlorine, which is a major impurity. This means special considerations have to be made when using DCS based WSix in comparison with MS based WSix. This work provides evaluation and control of chlorine behaviors in DCS based WSix film.","chemistry_names":   [

High-resolution lattice images of Al-Mn-Si taken with the 200 kV microscope show characteristic features of a model of the three-dimensional Penrose tiling, and also show the existence of quenched phason strains and edge-type dislocations in the Al-Mn-Si and as-casted Al-Fe-Cu alloys. After annealing the stable Al-Fe-Cu icosahedral phase at 1118 K for 48 hr, quenched phason strains are almost relaxed and nearly perfect icosahedral symmetry is formed.

In order to investigate fluorine behavior, we calculated the energy of fluorine defect structures in the framework of density functional theory (DFT). Besides identifying the ground-state con.guration of a single fluorine atom in silicon, a set of energetically favorable fluorine defect structures were found.

 {"abstract":"Iron aluminides with the B2 structure are highly oxidation and corrosion resistant. They arethermodynamically compatible with a wide range of ceramics such as TiC, WC, TiB2, and ZrB2. Inaddition, liquid iron aluminides wet these ceramics very well. Therefore, FeAI/ceramic compositesmay be produced by techniques such as liquid phase sintering of powder mixtures, or pressureless meltinfiltration of ceramic powders with liquid FeAl. These techniques, the resulting microstructures, andtheir advantages as well as limitations are described. Iron aluminide composites can be very strong.Room temperature flexure strengths as high as 1.8 GPa have been observed for FeAl/WC. Substantialgains in strength at elevated temperatures (1073 K) have also been demonstrated. Above 40 vol.% WCthe room temperature flexure strength becomes flaw-limited. This is thought to be due to processingflaws and limited interfacial strength. The fracture toughness of FeAl/WC is unexpectedly high andfollows a rule of mixtures. Interestingly, sufficiently thin (<1 μm) FeAl ligaments between adjacentWC particles fracture not by cleavage, but in a ductile manner. For these thin ligaments the dislocationpile-ups formed during deformation are not long enough to nucleate cleavage fracture, and theirfracture mode is therefore ductile. For several reasons, this brittle-to-ductile size transition does notimprove the fracture toughness of the composites significantly. However, since no cleavage cracks arenucleated in sufficiently thin FeAl ligaments, slow crack growth due to ambient water vapor does notoccur. Therefore, as compared to monolithic iron aluminides, environmental embrittlement is dramaticallyreduced in iron aluminide composites.","chemistry_names":   [

The distance between a semiconductor surface and a vibrating tip is changed sinusoidally, and is adjusted to as small as a few nm across which tunneling current IT flows between the semiconductor surface and the vibrating tip. Displacement current ID due to the change in electric flux from the semiconductor surface to the vibrating tip flows periodically in accordance with the vibration of the tip.

In the tip voltage range within which majority carriers are accumulated, ID-V curve is extrapolated by a straight line. On the contrary, the slope of the curve decreases as the tip voltage is reduced from the voltage range of the accumulation, indicating that the majority carriers are depleted at the center of the Si surface. The theoretical ID-V curves are in good agreement with the measurement in the tip voltage region where the majority carriers are both accumulated and depleted.

The smaller atom showed higher diffusivity and more configurational randomness compared to the larger atom. The viscosity increased abruptly around the glass transition temperature. The solvent/solute concentration effect on the glass transition was examined in terms of a packing fraction. We find that the glass forming ability increases with the packing fraction in the liquid state because the densely-packed material requires more time to rearrange and crystallize.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"The tungsten and vanadium oxides are well known to be usable as solid lubricants at elevated temperatures. Such metal-oxides are interesting for tribological insets at atmospheric conditions because of their \u201coxidation stability\u201d. This paper reports about investigations made to find stable process windows for the deposition of tungsten and vanadium oxides in a reactive d.c. mode by the MSIP-PVD-process. One focus of the study is on the metal oxide-phases generated in the MSIP-process under various conditions and their mechanical and metallographic properties. Coatings were deposited, developed and analyzed by standard testing methods such as SEM, microhardness (nanoindentation), XRD and scratch testing to characterize the mechanical and structural properties. Stable process windows will be presented for the reactive mode as well as the influence of different process parameters to the microstructure and the material properties. It will be shown that it is possible to deposit vanadium-oxides despite contamination effects in wide ranges by adapting the gas-flow. Process failure was determined at 15 - 18 % oxygen partial pressure for reactively deposited tungsten oxides.","chemistry_names":   [

We observe marked improvements in the properties of gold nanospheres with a DTC-anchored rather than physisorbed PAH cap. The same level of improvement is not seen in silver nanoparticles, although it is clear from a distinct change in the plasmon spectrum in silver nanocubes that the DTC ligand does interact with the silver surface. In spite of their amine functionalization, both silver and gold particles show low cytotoxicity, possibly due to absorption of serum proteins forming a protective coating on the positively charged particle surface.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"The deformation structure of B2 type TiNi compound around 573 K has been investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Serrations are seen in stress-strain curve, which corresponds to the formation of various planar defects with twin relation. The dominant planar defect found in the specimens showing serration is {114} compound twin. The other defects are in mirror symmetry with respect to {113}, {115}, {447} planes and so on. These defects are considered to be <110> symmetric tilt boundaries in bcc structure by ignoring the atomic arrangement of B2 structure and are characterized with Σ value based on coincide site lattice (CSL) model. For instance, the Σ value of {114}, {113}, {115} and {447} boundaries are Σ9, Σ11, Σ27 and Σ81, respectively. Numerous (114) defects initially form at grain boundary and grow into grain interior. Some of those deflect to (-1\u201314) defects. In such case, the {447} Σ81defect is always observed at the interface of (114) Σ9 and (-1\u201314) Σ9 defects. This fact indicates that the sigma combination rule of the CSL model can be applied to the triple junction of defects. Similarly, {7710} Σ99 boundary forms at the interface of {114} Σ9 and {113} Σ11 defects. It can be concluded that the ductility of B2 type TiNi compound around 573 K is attributable to the formation of various planar defects with large shear strain and the increment of independent slip system due to the formation of planar defects, and that the arrangement of some planar defects conforms to the sigma combination rule of CSL model.","chemistry_names":   [

Therefore several polysilicon films are deposited on thermally oxidized [100] silicon wafers. These samples are characterized by VASE in the optical range of 450 - 850 nm. Parameters are determined by simulation using a multilayer model consisting of air, interface layer (surface roughness), polysilicon, SiO2 and silicon substrate. Different optical models representing the properties of polysilicon are tested. The free parameters are the oxide thickness, the composition and the thickness of the interface layer (air, polysilicon) as well as the thickness and the complex refractive index of the polysilicon layer. Results of the spectroscopic analysis are verified by AFM and SEM measurements.

The derivatives were deposited as an active layer in an organic field-effect transistor (OFET) using vacuum sublimation.  The dihexyl and tetrahexyl derivatives (2H-HBC, 4H-HBC) increased the field-effect mobilities and on/off ratios by a factor of 10 or more compared to unsubstituted HBC and hexahexyl-hexabenzocoronene (6H-HBC).

The data indicate that 2H-HBC and 4H-HBC self-assemble into lamellar aggregates.  2H-HBC forms layers of aromatic cores that are sandwiched by the layers of hexyl groups, which is a preferable crystal structure for carrier transport. The good OFET performance could be explained by the self-assembly in lamellar aggregates of 2H-HBC and 4H-HBC, in contrast to self-assembly in the columnar aggregate of 6H-HBC and the low self-assembling properties of unsubstituted HBC.","chemistry_names":   [

Two main absorption bands centered at 5.8eV(215nm) and 4.8eV(260nm) are induced both in the densified and undensified glasses under the irradiation of X-rays at room temperature. The 5.8eV band is enhanced with the increase in density for the glass with low-OH content(<˜200ppm), but is decreased slightly for the glass with high-OH content(>˜200ppm). On the other hand, the 4.8eV band decreases with the increase in density irrespective of OH content, and reaches at a constant value above the densification of about 0.5%.

The investigated crystal was synthesized from commercial starting materials of PbCl2, KCl, and HoCl3 followed by several purification steps including directional freezing, zone-refinement, and chlorination. The Ho: KPC crystal was subsequently grown by Bridgman technique. Following optical excitation at 885 nm, several IR emission bands were observed at room-temperature with average wavelengths at 1.07, 1.18, 1.35, 1.65, 2.00, 2.94, and 3.96 μm. The emission at 3.96 μm originated from the 5I5 -> 5I6 transitions of Ho3+ and was further evaluated for possible applications in mid-IR lasers. The decay time of the 5I5 excited state was measured to be 5.0 ms at room-temperature. The long 5I5 lifetime is favorable for laser applications and indicates that non-radiative multi-phonon relaxations are small in Ho: KPC. Based on a Judd-Ofelt analysis, the emission quantum efficiency was determined to be near unity resulting in a peak emission cross-section of 0.62×10-20 cm2 at 3.96 μm. A drawback for laser applications is the long decay time of the lower 5I6 state with a value of 4.8 ms . Since the 3.96 μm transition terminates in the 5I6 level, its long lifetime will lead to population bottlenecking, which limits possible mid-IR lasing to pulsed and quasi-cw operation.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Near edge X-ray absorption spectra (XANES) have been obtained from the Ti K-edge for several series of titanium silicide samples produced by different techniques. Samples were fabricated by depositing Ti on silicon wafers and subsequently annealing them up to temperatures from 100°C to 900°C in UHV, vacuum furnace, or in a Rapid Thermal Annealing system. Measurements were done in the fluorescence and total electron yield modes. The XANES measurements were correlated with Raman scattering measurements. The XANES data of several reference compounds were obtained, and the data showed a high sensitivity to changes in the film structure. Ti metallic bonding and Ti-Si bonds can be distinguished and their evolution as a function of annealing is related to previous results. For the samples with increased impurities, Ti regions were stable at higher temperatures. The XANES spectra of samples annealed under N2 indicate the formation of a surface nitride.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"X-ray diffraction, chemical etching and electron microscopy are useful in delineating the microstructural properties of c-axis normal oriented polycrystalline zinc oxide films, sputter deposited on amorphous substrates. Dense ZnO films with high crystalline content and low etch rates have a strong piezoelectric effect and low surface acoustic wave and guided optical wave propagation loss. The structural properties are dependent upon substrate conditions, deposition parameters and the type of sputtering system used. Scanning electron microscope examination of the surface and side fractures of high quality ZnO films show smooth continuous upper surface and side regions with no vertical fiber grain structures apparent. Light chemical etching reveals surface defects consisting of uniformly distributed conical shaped etch pit structures with a lateral to vertical etch ratio of 3 to 1. A correlation has been made between film structure and single crystal zinc oxide. The structural picture which emerges is that of a predominantly positive polarity (0001) upper surface layer with localized negative polarity (0001) fiber grain inversions. The sputter conditions which lead to low defect density films are a high substrate temperature, high deposition rate and low reactive gas pressures to promote the adatom mobility necessary for the preferred (0001) zinc face growth. Post deposition laser and thermal annealing can be used to reduce stress in the films and improve their guided optical wave properties.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"In our previous investigations [1, 2], we have demonstrated that the introduction of fatigue pre-crack ahead of a notch is required to measure reliable fracture toughness values even for micro-sized specimens. However, it is rather difficult to introduce a fatigue pre-crack into a micro-sized specimen as once a fatigue crack starts to grow then the fatigue fracture occurs within one thousand cycles and this makes it extremely difficult to control fatigue crack length. Therefore, a new fatigue pre-cracking method is required for measuring fracture toughness. In this investigation, a new fatigue pre-cracking method has been proposed for micro-sized specimens and fracture toughness tests were carried out for the micro-sized specimens with fatigue pre-crack. Micro-cantilever beam type specimens with dimensions of 10 × 10 × 50 μm3 were prepared from an electroless deposited Ni-P amorphous alloy thin film and notches were introduced by focused ion beam machining. Fatigue pre-cracks were introduced ahead of the notches by far-field cyclic compression method using a mechanical testing machine for micro-sized specimens (MFT2000). Fracture tests were also carried out using the testing machine. Fatigue pre-cracks with length of 0.2 μm were confirmed on the fracture surfaces ahead of the notches in the far-field cyclically compressed specimens. This indicates that the fatigue pre-cracking method developed in this investigation is promising for measuring accurate fracture toughness for micro-sized specimens for MEMS applications.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"A brief excerpt of a more comprehensive quantitative theoretical analysis on the role of effective rate constants in interfacial processes is given (in particular [1], see also [2,3]). Chemical incorporation, tracer incorporation and steady state electrical experiments are considered. It is shown that besides experimental differences there are mechanistic and conceptual differences between the three effective rate constants (kδ, k*, Qq). The treatment based on irreversible thermodynamics and chemical kinetics shows similarities and differences with respect to the analogous situation in the bulk. As special cases adsorption and transfer limited kinetics are considered. Having related the k-values to the exchange rates of the rate determining step and to the chemical capacitance outside the boundary zone, the characteristic dependencies on controlling parameters and also the correlation with diffusion coefficients can be derived. This is done for electron-rich materials such as SOFC cathodes. A further point which is briefly mentioned in this context is the fact that flux constriction effects may lead to apparent surface rate constants. The role of space charges is briefly discussed for the case of grain boundary kinetics [4]. In electron-poor materials such as SrTiO3(Fe2O3) or Zr02(Y203) additional mechanistic differences should occur, since in the tracer case mechanisms are possible at the surfaces which do not have to involve electrons directly. Here also discrepancies with respect to electrical experiments are predicted (leading to a surface analogue of a Haven ratio). Some experimental results obtained with SrTiO3 are discussed in this context.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"The modification of surface reactions with an inert gas plasma treatment method has been investigated for the first time in order to improve the properties of a-Si:H for solar cells. The deposition of a thin a-Si:H layer and exposure to inert gas plasma such as He, Ar or Xe were repeated by using RF plasma CVD at a substrate temperature of 200 °C. It has been found that the hydrogen content (CH) can be controlled in a wide range from about 18 atomic% to about 35 atomic%, although it is a hydrogen-free process. Experimental results show that the change in CH of a-Si:H films is mainly determined by the decrease in CH of the treated a-Si:H surface and the increase in CH of the a-Si:H deposited on the treated surface. Furthermore, the plasma treatment probably promotes the surface reaction, which reduces SiH2ISiH and CH. Consequently, wide-gap (1.64 eV by ( a h ν )1/3 versus h ν plots, 1.75 - 1.85 eV by Tauc's plot) a-Si:H films with high stabilized photoconductivity (> 10-5 Ω-1cm-1 under AM-1, 100 mW/cm2 irradiation) have been obtained by the inert gas plasma treatment method.","chemistry_names":   [

Up to five holes charged in a Ge dot with a lateral dimension of 13nm is observed. The energy levels of ground state and first excited state are determined.

The brushes were made by preferential adsorption of polyvinylpryridinepolystyrene (PVP-PS) block copolymers adsorbed onto atomically smooth surfaces from a dilute solution of toluene. Extremely parallel lateral motion was imparted to one surface and the response was detected at the opposing brush-covered surface. When the brushes were bathed in a good solvent, it was necessary to strongly compress the layers in order to observe frictional forces transmitted between the surfaces. However, when the solvent was changed to a near-theta solvent, large frictional forces were measured at weaker compressions. The onset of these frictional forces occurred at distances comparable to the distance at which the opposing layers contact one another and rapidly increase as the brushes are compressed. Arguments are advanced that this behavior is attributable to frictional interactions between the polymer chains and the solvent.","chemistry_names":   [

Below this, a plateau or decrease is often observed. Similar observations are made for nanoscale multilayer thin films. There, TEM observations and modeling suggest that the hardness peak may be associated with the inability of interfaces to contain dislocations within individual nanoscale layers. This manuscript pursues the same concept for nanoscale polycrystalline metals via an analytic study of dislocation nucleation and motion within a regular 2D hexagonal array of grains. The model predicts a hardness peak and loss of dislocation confinement in the 5 to 30 nm grain size regime, but only if the nature of dislocation interaction with grain boundaries changes in the nanoscale regime.","chemistry_names":   [

The developed epitaxial process including an effective H2 in-situ preclean annealing has been integrated in a simple double mesa technology for the preparation of SiGe base heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBT). Despite the simplicity of the technology and the lithographical level allowing emitter dimensions of 2.3×2.5 μm2 only, test devices on 4\u201d wafers reached transit frequencies fT and maximum oscillation frequencies fmax of higher than 60 GHz and 30 GHz, respectively. Besides, a low base current has been measýnl as proof for a good layer quality.","chemistry_names":   [

Previous studies have shown that this compound spontaneously inserts into bilayer membranes in both synthetic and microbial living systems and can facilitate visualization of cell membranes through fluorescence imaging. In the presented research, we seek to further study and exploit the multifunctional nature of DSBN+ in terms of membrane interactions and photophysical properties for visualization of membranous structures of more complex mammalian cells, namely a human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cell line. Obtained results confirm the possibility of applying DSBN+ as a fluorescent dye for bioimaging of membranes in human cell cultures systems, both in live-cell imaging and in the studies required formaldehyde fixation.

 {"abstract":"For any viable blood substitute, questions of long-term storage and shelf-life must be addressed. Recently, we have made great progress in improving the stability of the blood substitute, liposome encapsulated hemoglobin (LEH). We have concentrated our efforts on protecting LEH in solution and in the long-term preservation of LEH by lyophilization. In particular, we have been able to retard and in some cases, reverse the oxidative process of metHb formation in solution by the addition of antioxidants such as NADH and glutathione. We have been able to regenerate Hb preparations with 60% metHb by the addition of 10 mM NADH and glutathione. In these preparations addition of these antioxidants results in a decrease of metHb levels from 62% to 15% over the course of 12.5 days at 4°C. We have also explored the use of protective solutes such as the disaccharide trehalose in the preservation of LEH in the freeze-dried state. Addition of increasing amounts of trehalose and other disaccharides results in the inhibition of lyophilization-induced fusion events and in the retention of hemoglobin within the unilamellar liposomal vesicles following rehydration.","chemistry_names":   [

However, the spectral peak position shifts toward lower energies as the delay time increases and becomes redshifted at longer delay times.

Measurements were made in a symmetric-reflection geometry so that the strains normal to the sample surface could be examined at different positions along the conductor lines. Results of thermal strain measurements show that the SiO2 passivation plays an important role in limiting relaxation of in-plane compressive thermal stresses in the Al lines, but that the passivation is not effective in confining the overall thermal expansion of the Al line along the film normal. Electromigration strain measurements show that a linear stress gradient developed within the first hour of electromigration. The magnitude of the stress gradient changed little until fast stress relaxations occurred near the anode end of the line.

With the proper choice of deposition parameters (111) faceted, octahedral, flat (100) and microcrystalline diamond films were obtained. Scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and stylus profilometry were used to assess the surface topography for each type of film. Raman spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction were also used to determine the purity of the diamond phase and growth orientation of the films, respectively. Single pass friction and wear tests were conducted on each film in order to determine the effect of surface morphology on the coefficient of friction and wear of the counterface materials and/or diamond films. Counterface materials included alumina, tungsten carbide, zirconia, and the (100) face of a synthetic diamond single crystal. Results showed a decrease in the coefficient of friction as the film roughness decreased. Specific wear of the non-diamond counterface materials showed a marked decrease for the flatter and smoother diamond surfaces. For diamond on diamond, the coefficient of friction also decreased as film topography became smoother. Wear of the diamond films occurred by fracture or shearing of asperity tips which was most severe for the rougher films. Control of diamond morphology is shown to be of paramount importance in tribological applications in order to reduce abrasive wear, material transfer, and diamond film fracturing.","chemistry_names":   [

In fact, simultaneous measurement of spectral photoresponse and spectral reflectance, as a distinctive signature of the device probed, is an ideal, high speed, non-invasive means of evaluation for such thin films at high spatial resolution (∼ 100 nm) using beam scanning. This paper discusses three aspects of such evaluation. First, the spectral transmittance of the film as a direct function of the microstructure, second, the use of band-gap illumination (365 nm) to condition a fatigued capacitor; and third, the optical E field interaction with the ferroelectric capacitor, yielding a high speed photoresponse which is related to the remanent polarization and the operational history (status of internal fields) of the ferroelectric capacitor. Combined, these different kinds of photoresponses provide a good signature of the device quality.","chemistry_names":   [

As an interstitial defect in Si, the H2 molecule has given rise to a number of perplexing puzzles since the discovery of its vibrational spectrum. The absence of an ortho-para splitting for the H2 vibrational line and an apparent low symmetry found in stress experiments misled several researchers into thinking that interstitial H2 in Si must have a barrier to rotation. Our discovery of a new vibrational line for HD in Si and its interpretation, along with the recognition that certain transitions are possible for HD, but not for H2 or D2, establish that H2 in Si is a nearly free rotator after all. Additional puzzles such as the anomalous intensity of the HD line, the absence of an isotope dependence for the uniaxial stress splitting of the H2 and D2 vibrational lines, and the properties of an O-H2 complex are also explained naturally. Recent Raman studies confirm that interstitial H2 in Si is a free rotator but raise interesting new questions about the diffusivities of the ortho and para species.","chemistry_names":   [

This result strongly suggested the possibility that the main part of the internal stress of the high-temperature deformation of icosahedral Al-Pd-Mn is explained by σb.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"The optical absorption spectra of intersubband transitions in In0.3Ga0.7As/GaAs multiple quantum dots (MQDs) grown by molecular beam epitaxy were investigated. By varying the number of In0.3Ga0.7As monolayers deposited, a series of samples with varying dot sizes ranging from 10 \u2013 50 monolayers were obtained. The quantum dots grown with size less than 15 monolayers or more than 50 monolayers did not yield any observable measurements of intersubband transition. This suggests that there exist a critical upper and lower limit of In0.3Ga0.7As quantum dots for infrared detectors. A wavelength range of 8.60 \u2013 13.70 μm is achieved for structures grown with the above monolayers range. The theoretical line-shape of the intersubband transition absorption was compared to the experimental measurements. From the lineshape, it was deduced that bound-to-continuum transtition is present in thick quantum dots and bound-to-bound transition is present in thinly grown quantum dots.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Two techniques for dry etching of sol-gel lead zirconate titanate (PZT 52/48) thin films were investigated: reactive ion etching and argon ion milling. Etched profiles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. For reactive ion etching, a parallel plate etcher was used with HC2ClF4, an environmentally safe etch gas, in a process described by other researchers. Etch rates were measured and compared as a function of electrode shield material (ardel, graphite, alumina) and RF input power (100 to 500 W). These etch rates varied from 10 to 100 nm/min. Reactive ion etched sidewall angles 12° off normal were consistently produced over a wide range of RF powers and etch times, but overetching was required to produce a clean sidewall. For argon ion milling, a 300 mA/500 V beam 40° off normal to the substrate operating in a 72 mPa argon pressure was used. These ion milling conditions produced an etch rate of 250 nm/min with a sidewall slope angle of about 70°. The ion milling etch rate for sol-gel PZT was significantly faster than rates reported for bulk PZT. The 500 nm thick PZT films used in this study were prepared by the sol-gel process that used methoxyethanol solvent, spin coating on t/Ti/SiO2 silicon substrates, and rapid thermal annealing for 30 s at 650 °C for crystallization of the perovskite phase.","chemistry_names":   [

Furthermore, fibrin acts as a provisional matrix in vivo for tissue regeneration. While the majority of studies seek to manipulate fibrin gel properties by changing the concentration of clotting proteins, these studies highlight our capacity to change bulk stiffness and fiber properties by supplementing the solutions with sodium chloride (NaCl). Physical properties including fiber thickness, porosity, compressive modulus, and fluid uptake capacity were dependent on NaCl content, with gels containing 2.60% (w/v) NaCl exhibiting compressive moduli threefold higher than gels without NaCl. These material properties, in turn, affected the gel morphology along with the osteogenic and pro-angiogenic response of entrapped mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). The osteoconductivity of fibrin gels can be enhanced by inclusion of apatite-coated polymer substrata to nucleate mineral, while the efficacy of engineered fibrin gels to simultaneously deploy small molecules with cells to enhance endogenous angiogenic potential has been demonstrated.

Whereas the SAN layer was stable upon annealing at 190°C, the PC layer dewetted the SAN and formed holes whose diameter increased linearly with time. Auger electron spectroscopy measurements confirmed that PC was fully removed from the interior of the hole. Upon varying the AN content, the dewetting velocity was found to be a minimum near 0.27 weight percent AN. This result is consistent with the interfacial thermodynamics between PC and SAN. Atomic force microscopy was used to provide a unique image of the hole profile.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Plastic response of a solid under stress depends on its crystallographic structure and morphology. Two of the major mechanisms of plasticity in metals are crystallographic slip and twinning. The purpose of this work is to analyze the influence of local stress distribution on slip and twin nucleation and propagation and to examine how this behavior depends on the interaction among slips, twins, and grain boundaries. We formulate a simple model in which slip and twin systems are defined at appropriate angles to each other. Plastic flow is treated as a Markovian stochastic process consisting of a series of local inelastic transformations (LITs) in the representative volume elements (RVE). The probabilities of LITs per unit time are defined in the framework of transition-state theory. By varying the types of allowed LITs and/or the scale of RVE, plastic deformation is modeled at different structural levels, from a small volume of single crystal to the aggregate response of an isotropic polycrystalline solid. An important feature of this model is that evolution of the internal stress distribution is traced explicitly throughout the simulation run. This allows us to examine conditions of slip and twinning in considerable detail. In particular, we observe that twinning occurs through a nucleation-and-growth mechanism whose rate is controlled by the size of the critical nucleus of the new phase.","chemistry_names":   [

Numerical simulations show not only detailed agreement with the experiment but also predict that the studied system has no stable solutions for carrier concentration higher than 1017 cm−3. According to this prediction, partial screening of the external electric field generates current instabilities and oscillations, and that is experimentally observed.

Various approaches have been used to improve the dielectric properties of BST thin films such as doping, graded compositions, and multilayer structures. We have found that inserting a ZrO2 layer in between two BST layers results in a significant reduction in dielectric constant as well as dielectric loss. In this work the effect of Y2O3 doped ZrO2 on the dielectric properties of BST/ZrO2/BST trilayer structure is studied. The structure Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3/(Y2O3)x(ZrO2)1-x/Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3 is deposited by a sol-gel process on platinized Si substrate. The composition (x) of the middle layer is varied while keeping the total thickness of the trilayer film constant. The dielectric constant of the multilayer film decreases with the increase of Y2O3 amount in the film whereas there is a slight variation in dielectric loss. In Y2O3 doped multilayer thin films, the dielectric loss is lower in comparison to other films and also there is good frequency stability in the loss in the measured frequency range and hence very suitable for microwave device applications.","chemistry_names":   [

Specialized epilayer lift-off procedures enabled TEM characterization of the defect distributions in macroscopic area films, effectively increasing the field of view of the technique by several orders of magnitude. These lateral distributions correlated well with those observed on both Bragg and grazing Bragg- Laue topographs. Grazing Bragg-Laue images also afforded depth sensitivity. Excellent correlations exist between results obtained with all these techniques for systems with a wide range of In concentrations, corresponding to a broad range of interfacial dislocation densities, although only results for x=;0.085 are presented.

 {"abstract":"Corrosive behavior of commercial organopolysulfides of the type R-(S)n-R is known to increase dramatically towards copper-based alloys when n ≥ 4, whereas di- and trisulfides are essentially inert. Three possible reasons for this behavior are examined using local and nonlocal density-functional theory as well as post-Hartree-Fock theory at the MP2 level. The hypotheses are: the shorter chains are protected from the surface by steric hindrance of the terminal organic groups, longer polysulfides can chelate copper atoms and remove them from the surface, and S-S bonds become weaker and more reactive as the polysulfide chains become longer. We find the predominant reason for the increase in corrosive behavior to be a dramatic decrease in S-S bond dissociation energy when n ≥ 4 due to stabilization of the unpaired electron via delocalization in RSS\u2022 thiyl radicals. The thiyl radicals are thus the species which is capable of attacking and corroding the copper surface. Chelation is eliminated as a possible mechanism, and steric protection and oil solubility afforded by the organic terminal groups are found to play a minor role.","chemistry_names":   [

AFM phase imaging was used to determine filler size, degree of aggregation, and distribution within the soft PDMS matrix. A small tensile stage was used to measure mechanical properties. Samples were not pulled to break in order to study Mullins and aging effects. Several identical 35 phr samples were subjected to an initial stress, and then one each was reevaluated over intervals up to 26 weeks to determine the degree to which these samples recovered their initial stress-strain behavior as a function of time. One sample was tested before and after heat treatment to determine if heating accelerated recovery of the stress-strain behavior. The effect of filler surface treatment on mechanical properties was examined for two samples containing 35 phr filler treated or untreated with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDZ), respectively. Fiduciary marks were used on several samples to determine permanent set. 35 phr filler samples were found to give the optimum mechanical properties. A clear Mullins effect was seen. Within experimental error, no change was seen in mechanical behavior as a function of time or heat-treatment. The mechanical properties of the sample containing the HDMZ treated silica were adversely affected. AFM phase images revealed aggregation and nonuniform distribution of the filler for all samples. Finally, a permanent set of about 3 to 6 percent was observed for the 35 phr samples.","chemistry_names":   [

The temperature coefficients of resistivity (TCR) have been calculated. TCR value is decreased with P content increasing and becomes negative for Ni46Pd31P23 alloy. On the other hand, TCR value is increased with Pd content increasing while P content is not changed. Such behavior could be attributed to the electronic transfer effect from Ni to Pd and from P to Ni. These lead to the Fermi level shift to d-band edge and to the increasing influence of the Mott's localized state. The peculiarities caused by structural relaxation processes have been observed at the temperature range of 550 \u2013 620 K. The relaxation process was shown to consist at least of two stages.

 {"abstract":"We have investigated the reproducibility of micro- and nano-scale measurements of sheet resistance performed with micro-fabricated multi-point probes. The probes consisted of Au coated SiO2 cantilevers extending from a Si base. The measurements were done with a four-point probe technique on thin Au films, the probe electrode spacing ranging from 18 μm to 1.5 μm. We find that the standard deviation of repeated sheet resistance measurements ranges from 0.2% at 18 μm spacing to 2.6% at 1.5 μm spacing. It is inversely proportional to the probe electrode spacing. This behaviour is expected if the resolution of the measurements is governed by the positional errors of the probe electrode tips. The corresponding standard deviation of the probe tip positions (in both lateral directions) is calculated to be approximately 20 nm. We argue that these positional errors depend on the probe cantilever amplitude at the time of contacting the surface. The amplitude is inversely proportional to the square root of the cantilever spring constant, indicating that stiff cantilevers give the best reproducibility. We estimate the limiting reproducibility of multi-point probes with nano-scale electrode spacing.","chemistry_names":   [

A discussion of sources of hydrostatic tensile stress in such lines provides a reasonable upper limit of 2 GPa. The void nucleation rate is then calculated at various sites within the line. Results suggest that nucleation rates are far too low to account for observed rates of voiding. Void nucleation at a flaw at the line/passivation interface is then considered as an alternative nucleation mechanism. Such flaws may be created by contaminants introduced during fabrication of the line. In this case, nucleation is feasible at greatly reduced stresses, well within the observed values. Furthermore, a simple model of void growth indicates that a fast atomic transport path, such as a grain boundary, must intersect the void for an appreciable growth rate. These results suggest that void nucleation in aluminum interconnect lines occurs at flaws at the sidewall of the line and that stress-induced and electromigration-induced voiding can be controlled by eliminating interfacial contamination.","chemistry_names":   [

We introduce and characterize a two-step transient laser annealing process to create fully densified zinc oxide films from nanoparticle ink precursors. A low temperature sub-millisecond calcining step to remove solvent and organic stabilizing ligands was followed by a high-temperature pulsed laser sintering step to form densified 50-100 nm thin films with resistivities of 10-1 to 10-3 Ω-cm. Film microstructures can be varied between crystalline and amorphous without significant film damage by adjusting the fluence of the high-temperature sintering step.

 {"abstract":"Using transient capacitance and transient spin techniques, we have the determined the manner in which the mobility gap energy of the D defect is altered following a change in its charge state. This relaxation process gives rise to a power law rather an exponential thermal release of defect electrons with time and also causes the charge emission and spin transients to obey a scaling law. We also deduce that the D°/D+ transition rate depends on the tenure of the proceeding D-/D° transition. This last aspect of the D defect emission behavior implies that it must be treated as a non-Markovian process. Such relaxation dynamics have profound consequences for the steady state distribution of D defect energies. Using the relaxation parameters determined by the transient measurements we have been able to solve a set of coupled differential equations under steady-state conditions to provide the energy distributions of both the D° and DD+ defect sub-bands. The results of these calculations agree remarkably well with the experimental distributions determined by modulated photocurrent and steady-state capacitance measurements. This implies that the statistical variations in the occupation history of the defect may be the dominant factor determining both distributions.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"We propose and demonstrate Bonding-in-Solution Technique (BiST) for encapsulation of liquid in MEMS devices. Liquid encapsulation enables innovative MEMS devices with various functions, such as hydraulic displacement amplification and scanning mirrors. Interfusion of air bubbles and leakage of the encapsulated liquid must be averted not to deteriorate device performances. Several liquid encapsulation processes have been proposed, such as parylene deposition and polymer thermal bonding. However, they involve vacuum and/or thermal processes and cannot be applied to volatile liquids. In BiST, two structural layers are passively aligned and brought into contact in solution, where the encapsulation cavities are uniformly filled up with the liquid without air bubbles. A UV-curable resin is used as an adhesive that does not require heat or vacuum environment but UV to bond the two layers. The detail processes of BiST are (a)UV-curable adhesive resin is coated onto the bonding surface of a structural layer. The layer contains not only encapsulating cavities but also concave-shaped structures for the following passive alignment. (b) The other layer with convex-shaped structures is brought into contact in solution, when the two layers are passively aligned by matching concave and convex structures. (c) UV light is irradiated and the two layers are permanently bonded while the contact is maintained by the jig. We successfully achieved encapsulation of DI water and glycerin in PDMS and silicon structural layers. No liquid remains in the bonding interface. Since conventional aligners are not applicable to BiST, we experimentally evaluated the accuracy of the passive alignment process in solution that makes use of matching concave and convex structures. We used a PDMS layer with cylinders (concave) and a silicon layer with cavities (convex) to evaluate the alignment in BiST. The height and depth of the cylinders and cavities are designed such that the PDMS cylinders elastically deform when the two layers are brought into contact. The elastic averaging enables the passive alignment of the two layers. We investigated the bonding accuracy with respect to the number of pairs of concave/convex structures and the height of PDMS cylinders while in contact. The bonding accuracy improved as the number of pairs increased while the height of PDMS cylinders did not show a correlation. The alignment accuracy of 5μm in BiST was achieved with 12 pairs of the concave/convex structures. The ultimate goal of our research is to develop innovative MEMS devices with encapsulated liquid, such as a hydraulic displacement amplification mechanism applicable to a tactile display. Glycerin was encapsulated by largely-deformable-PDMS thin membranes and silicon cavities by using BiST. The displacement at the input was successfully amplified at the output associated with the ratio of the cross-sectional areas.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"As a potential micro-actuator material thin film shape memory alloys (SMAs) have drawn attention because of their capability of generating strains of a few percent reversibly. In contrast to SMAs the output strain of traditional actuator material, such as quartz and PZT ferroelectrics, is limited to 100 to 1000 ppm. The authors have investigated the transformation properties and microstructures of thin Ni50Ti50 films on Si. From application point of view, the evaluation of the actuator property should come from direct measurements of the strain output of the film/substrate composite. In the film/substrate composite, the martensitic transformation strains in the SMA thin film are coupled to elastically to the substrate through interface load transfer. Interface properties thus play crucial role on the efficiency of the composite actuators. Since the capability of interface load transfer is determined by the substrate stiffness, experiments were designed to measure the strain output of NiTi/Si composite with varying substrate stiffness. The experiments indicated that the output efficiency of the martensitic transformation strain increases by a factor of 2 when the film/substrate thickness ratio increases from 1/345 to 1/70. The result is favorable for micro-actuator application since much larger film/substrate ratios can be achieved by micro-machining. The absolute value of the transformation strain is about 2 percent which can be improved if the film texture is controlled.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"The slow flow of granular materials is often marked by the existence of narrow shear layers, adjacent to large regions that suffer little or no deformation. This behaviour, in the regime where shear stress is generated primarily by the frictional interactions between grains, has so far eluded theoretical description. In this paper, we present a rigid-plastic frictional Cosserat model that captures thin shear layers by incorporating a microscopic length scale. We treat the granular medium as a Cosserat continuum, which allows the existence of localised couple stresses and, therefore, the possibility of an asymmetric stress tensor. In addition, the local rotation is an independent field variable and is not necessarily equal to the vorticity. The angular momentum balance, which is implicitly satisfied for a classical continuum, must now be solved in conjunction with the linear momentum balances. We extend the critical state model, used in soil plasticity, for a Cosserat continuum and obtain predictions for flow in plane and cylindrical Couette devices. The velocity profile predicted by our model is in qualitative agreement with available experimental data. In addition, our model can predict scaling laws for the shear layer thickness as a function of the Couette gap, which must be verified in future experiments. Most significantly, our model can determine the velocity field in viscometric flows, which classical plasticity-based model cannot.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"The sticking coefficient for molecular oxygen on GaAs(110) up to about one-halft monolayer coverage can be enhanced by two or three orders of magnitude when the semiconductor surface is illuminated by an argon ion laser with intensities of 5 W/cm2 or less. Previous work has shown that this effect is nonthermal and roughly independent of wavelength for above-bandgap radiation, implying that photogenerated electrons and/or holes are responsible in some way. In this paper we present recent work which shows that transfer of energy from the GaAs to oxygen molecules physisorbed on the surface causes the breakup of the oxygen and so enhances the reaction. This conclusion comes from comparison of our photoemission results for O2 and N2O exposures made under the same conditions, N2O being chosen since only 1.7 eV is needed to remove the oxygen atom as opposed to the 5.1eV required to break an O-O bond. Nitrous oxide, in contrast to O2, shows only slight photoenhancement and has a much lower activation energy for the dissociative sticking coefficient, demonstrating that removal of the dissociation of O2 as a reaction step also removes the major part of the activation energy barrier to oxygen chemisorption. Since N20 and photoenhanced O2 have similar kinetics, we conclude that the breakup of O2 is the reaction step accelerated by illumination. Another clue to the nature of the photoenhancement comes from our finding that both n- and p-type GaAs display similar O2 laser enhancement ratios. An estimate of the carrier concentrations at the surface predicts that electrons and holes are present in equal amounts at the surfaces of both doping types, however, so this result does not distinguish between single-carrier and recombination-related enhancement mechanisms.","chemistry_names":   [

While the energy variation of this level indicates the expected mutli-band nature typical of a deep level, a severe and continuous reduction in the observed luminescence intensity was also observed.

Nano- Al is invariably used as fuel, while a host of metal oxide nanoparticles are used as oxidizers. This article aims at understanding and tuning the reactivity of these nano-energetic materials. The first part of this article discusses the oxidative reactivity of aluminum nanoparticles as measured experimentally using single-particle mass-spectrometer (SPMS) and microscopy and then modeled. Experimental evidence suggests that outward diffusion of aluminum is an important phenomenon in the oxidation of aluminum nanoparticle. Also melting of the aluminum core is necessary for the reaction to take place vigorously. In the second part of the paper we discuss the formation of novel oxidizers. A super-reactive formulation of Al/KMnO4 has been developed which is shown to be orders of magnitude more reactive than the traditional formulations of Al/Fe2O3, Al/MoO3 and Al/CuO. We demonstrate the formation of novel composite oxidizers to tune the reactivity of the Al/Metal oxide system.","chemistry_names":   [

Excess TiO2 enhanced the material diffusion while AI2O3 did not, and appeared to develop more anisotropy of Al2TiO5 grains, resulting in lower expansion.

 {"abstract":"We present real time observations of the interaction of dislocations in heteroepitaxial strained layers using a specially modified ultrahigh vacuum transmission electron microscope equipped with in-situ deposition capabilities. These observations have led to delineation of the regime of epilayer thickness and composition where dislocation interactions result in blocking of the propagating threading segment. It is found that both the blocking probability as well as the magnitude of the dislocation interaction force are strongly dependent on the Burgers vectors of the dislocations involved, with the greatest effects observed when the Burgers vectors of the two dislocations are parallel with respect to each other. Frame-by-frame analysis of the motion of the dislocation threading segment during interaction is used to extract the magnitude of the interaction stresses as a function of both the level of heteroepitaxial strain and the dislocation geometry. Finally, by continuing growth following observations of blocking during annealing, we find that blocked dislocations are likely to remain in that configuration until substantial additional heteroepitaxial stresses are incorporated into the layer. These results have direct relevance to the successful integration of strained layer heterostructures into electronic device applications. This is because blocked threading segments result in the introduction of undesired band gap states, enhance impurity diffusion, modify surface morphology and act to limit the dislocation density reductions achievable in graded buffer structures.","chemistry_names":   [

Spark plasma sintering is used since it reduces time at high temperature and inhibits grain growth. The produced materials have grain sizes in the nano and microscale depending on the material and processing variables. The TiAl3-X alloys are formed mostly by the cubic L12 phase. The average grain size ranges between 30 and 50 nm in the as sintered condition. Aging at elevated temperature has been used to promote grain growth. Compression tests have been performed to evaluate mechanical properties as a function of temperature and grain size. In all cases yield stresses higher that 700 MPa are obtained together with a ductility that depends upon temperature and grain size. No ductility is found for the smallest grains sizes tested (30 nm) at room temperature. Above 673 K, these materials show ductility and additionally they present a quasi superplastic behavior at temperatures higher that 973 K. On the other hand ductility can also be developed in the TiAl3-X alloys by inducing grain growth via annealing. Alloys with grains sizes around 500 nm show high ductility and a large density of microcraks after deformation suggesting that the yield strenght becomes lower than the stress to propagate the cracks. In such materials, a considerably high strength is retained up to 873 K.","chemistry_names":   [

These sheets were drawn directly from a CNT forest, stacked layer-by-layer together and densified by isopropyl alcohol. CNT emitters were formed by utilizing laser beam to cut the sheet. The FE performance of the proposed devices has been enhanced dramatically. The threshold field for electron emission (at which the emission current is 10 mA/cm2) was 0.88 V/μm. The current density of 36 A/cm2 was achieved at the electric field of 2 V/μm.

 {"abstract":"The effects of film thickness and passivation on plasticity of thin metal films on substrates have been studied using gold films as a model system. Wafer curvature/thermal cycling measurements were used to study plasticity in films ranging in thickness from 0.2 to 2.5 micrometers. We were able to describe these stress-temperature curves using a simple phenomenological model for linear kinematic hardening. The yield stresses revealed by the modeling were inversely proportional to the film thickness for thicknesses greater than about one micrometer. This relationship is expected from a dislocation model of plasticity. However, the residual stresses in thinner films are substantially lower than this relationship would predict and on unloading, these films show stress-temperature plots not predicted by the model. Stress-temperature curves were also measured after a tungsten passivation was deposited on the gold surface. Films thinner than one micrometer were substantially strengthened by this passivation and could then be described by the linear kinematic model. The observed stresses are only minimally affected for films thicker than about a micrometer. This strengthening effect on thinner films is consistent with the complete blocking of grain boundary diffusion near the free surface of the film.","chemistry_names":   [

These coefficients are found to be comparable to, and in some cases greater than those of commonly used wurtzite piezoelectrics. The centrosymmetry of a BN bilayer prevents a piezoelectric effect for this structure.

 {"abstract":"An important attribute of the high-level waste (HLW) disposal program in the United States (U.S.) is the estimated long life of waste packages (WPs). The outer container of the WP is proposed to be constructed of a nickel-based alloy, Alloy 22 (58Ni-21Cr-14Mo-3W-4Fe), which is highly corrosion resistant. Under nominal conditions of the proposed repository at Yucca Mountain (YM), Nevada, WPs are anticipated to have a long life because of their extremely slow uniform corrosion rate. The technical basis for this expected long life of geological scale is still subject of discussion. In this paper, the NRC Total-system Performance Assessment (TPA) Code is used to evaluate uncertainties associated with the WP performance within a 10,000-year period. Early WP failure may occur due to localized corrosion or high frequency of manufacturing defects. Localized corrosion may occur under mixed salt deposits on the WP surface at temperatures above 100°C. High frequencies of WP juvenile failure are considered to account for the limited industrial experience with Alloy 22 and uncertainty in the long-term performance of Alloy 22 as container material. The localized corrosion and the high frequency of manufacturing defects were simulated with the TPA code by lowering the critical relative humidity for the onset of aqueous corrosion, RHc, and increasing the fraction of initially defective WPs. By sampling RHc from various normal distributions, the mean annual total effective dose equivalent (TEDE) approached 1 mrem/year at 10,000 years. Assuming a fixed fraction of initially defective WPs (1 percent), the mean annual TEDE approached 0.07 mrem/year at 10,000 years.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Size segregation of particulates is of concern in a number of industries that handle materials such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, and food products. Of particular interest in this paper is segregation resulting from externally applied vibration. In industrial applications this vibration may either be applied intentionally in devices such as vibrating conveyors or \u201clive wall\u201d hoppers, or unintentionally during material handling and transport. This paper investigates size segregation in granular beds subject to discrete \u201ctaps\u201d and continuous, sinusoidal vertical vibration. The results from discrete element computer simulations indicate that the rise rate of a single impurity increases monotonically with amplitude for discrete vibrations but for continuous vibrations the rise rate increases, reaches a maximum value, then decreases as the oscillation amplitude increases.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Particle fluctuations in colloidal suspensions are generally considered to be much slower than the embedded fluid dynamics. It was recently proposed that the fluid self-diffusion nearby an interface follows Lévy statistics, extending the time domain of the fluid dynamics towards the low frequency range. It is then possible to probe colloidal particle motion and especially its evolution during a phase transition looking at the slow dynamics of the fluid molecule close to an particle surface. Using field cycling NMR relaxometry, we show how the slow and confined water dynamics at proximity of a colloidal surface provide an original way to follow the glass transition of a colloidal system made of plate-like Laponite particles, a synthetic clay. The interplay between fluid Levy dynamics and particle jamming is discussed. An analytical model involving correlated elementary water time steps on the colloidal interface is proposed and critically compared to our experimental data. The method permits probing of colloidal motions and especially their evolution during a phase transition in a new way. This method can be extended to other systems including mineral lyotropic liquid crystals and biological molecular structures.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Clathrate hydrates of structure II with organic cyclic oxides were identified to have the ability to include molecular hydrogen into their empty small cages at near-ambient temperature and moderate pressure. Solid-state NMR and Raman spectroscopy of the included hydrogen molecules indicate that the small cavities are both singly and doubly occupied by hydrogen molecules in the mixed hydrates. The inclusion mechanism can be derived from the critical progression of the cage occupancies as determined from in-situ kinetic experiments on formation and decomposition. The inclusion ability of hydrogen molecules was observed for several organic clathrate hydrate formers such as THF (tetrahydrofuran) and 1,4-dioxane, suggesting this to be a general property. A structural transition of the simple amine hydrate was suggested to produce a novel double CH4 + t-BuNH2 hydrate as confirmed by using microscopic analytical methods. The corresponding hydrate compositions were determined by using NMR spectroscopy to describe a tuning mechanism to increase the storage capacity.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Intermediate structures were trapped during the mesophase transition from lamellae to higher curvature structures in a sol-gel matrix. The target structures included normal hexagonally arranged cylinders and/or normal spheres in a cubic array distributed in a hydrophilic matrix. The present system is believed to be the first to trap these intermediates. Through solvent evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA), mesostructured silica/diblock films with large characteristic length scales were prepared. The structure-directing agents were polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) diblock copolymers with high molecular weight, which are water insoluble and alcohol insoluble. We believe that no micellization took place in the present system; a disorder-to-order transition occurred due to the cooperative self- assembly of the diblock and silicates as the solvent preferentially evaporated from a film cast from a dilute homogeneous solution. During further preferential evaporation, the morphogenic effect of the increase of species concentration facilitates the mesophase development in the direction of a normal cubic to hexagonal to lamellar pathway. However, the morphogenic effects of both the decrease of the PS coil dimension and the siloxane condensation drive the mesophase development in opposite directions. The decrease of the PS coil dimension plays an important role in the present self-assembly process. Trapping of the intermediates and coexisting multiple mesophases are related to the facts that PS has high Tg and high hydrophobicity in particular, as well as to the fact that polymers have relatively low mobility in general.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"A non-linear continuum theory of self-organized growth of composition-modulated structures in alloys is developed. It is shown that, for a lattice-matched alloy, where compositional and morphological instabilities are uncoupled in the linear regime, the two instabilities are coupled due to non-linear effects. Due to non-linear coupling, composition-induced stresses may lead to an instability of the advancing surface against undulations. A non-planar surface profile favors kinetic phase transition from the growth of a 1D modulated structure to the growth of a 2D one. A steady-state phase diagram in variables \u201ctemperature \u2014 growth velocity\u201d is constructed which contains regions of homogeneous alloy growth, of 1D steady-state structures, of 2D steady-state structures, and the region where both 1D and 2D structures are possible. For zinc-blend semiconductors, the interplay between the anisotropic elasticity and anisotropic surface diffusion may lead to the kinetic phase transition between the growth of a 2D structure modulated in the elastically soft directions [100] and [010] to the growth of a 1D structure modulated in the direction of the fast diffusion [110].

Very low resistivity Ru and rutile stoichiometric RuO2 films, deposited via reactive sputtering, were evaluated as gate electrodes on ultrathin Y-silicate, ZrO2 and Al2O3 films for Si-MOS devices. Thermal and chemical stability of the electrodes was studied at annealing temperatures up to 800°C in N2 and subsequently forming gas anneal. XRD and XPS were measured to study grain structure and interface reactions. The morphology of the films was tested by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Electrical properties were evaluated via MOS capacitors. The role of oxygen inside dielectrics was studied by comparing equivalent oxide thickness change as a function of annealing temperature for capacitors with Y-silicate, ZrO2and Al2O3 dielectrics. Good stability of Ru and RuO2 gate electrodes on all dielectrics studied was found. Flatband voltage and gate current as a function of annealing temperature was also studied. It was found that capacitors with Y-silicate after high-temperature anneal had less positive flatband voltage shift than ZrO2 and Al2O3. For capacitors with Ru gate electrode, the significant flatband voltage shift after high temperature anneal could be partially removed by a forming gas anneal.","chemistry_names":   [

Using synchrotron X-ray reflectivity and high-angle Bragg scattering we show that Fe(15Å)/Au(21Å) multilayers grown by sputtering exhibit different profiles for Fe/Au and Au/Fe interfaces. We analyze this in view of the action of Au as a surfactant during the growth of Fe. Similar Fe/Ag multilayers have considerably worse interfacial quality since Fe and Ag do not interdiffuse, and this leads to the result that the interfaces cannot be described by error function profiles. Using non-specular x-ray reflectivity we show that whereas Fe/Au interfaces are self-affine, Fe/Ag interfaces exhibit two regimes of scaling behavior as a function of spatial wavelength. This suggests that two different mechanisms are important in describing the growth of Fe/Ag films.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Nacre is a segmented layered composite containing both nanoscale-thick organic and sub- micrometer thick scale inorganic phases. In addition to controlling the formation of the intricate architecture, the organic plays a significant role in the mechanical properties of the biocomposite. In our previous work, three dimensional finite element models of nacre were constructed to design \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d micro-architecture to study effects of nonlinear response of the organic component. Recently, nanomechanical properties such as hardness and elastic moduli of the individual components of nacre have been determined using nanoindentation techniques. In this work, we used these actual properties of the components to perform mesoscale finite element models to quantitatively evaluate nanoscale effects. Specifically, we studied the effect of the solid contacts between the platelets through the organic layer on bulk properties under tensile and compressive loading. In the new 3D finite element model, we also incorporated the pseudo-hexagonal platelet morphology to more accurately represent the nacre microstructure. The multiscale approach in our study involves incorporation of experimentally obtained nanoscale parameters into meso-macroscale numerical models. Our simulations imply that mineral contacts in the aragonitic platelets have marginal impact both on bulk elastic behavior of nacre and yielding. Stress concentration in contact regions were high enough for the contacts to break long before yield started in nacre. These results have important implications in the design of biomimetic segmented-layered composites for improved mechanical properties.","chemistry_names":   [

The possibility to form a two dimensional arrangement of these micro droplets was explored with a suitable choice of the substrate material, and the method of coating. For the patterns prepared by the e-beam technique, a strong coupling between two closely spaced nano elements was observed, the spacing between them was found to be the key factor in tailoring their interaction, i.e., whether they would arrange themselves in rod-like pattern or a two dimensional array of isolated squares or circles.","chemistry_names":   [

In the Halperin Hohenberg(1) classification scheme this model is known as Model C with a symmetric coupling between nonconserved and conserved fields. The different time dependences of long (i.e., domain size lengths ∼ power law in time) and short wavelength (i.e., interfacial lengths ∼ exponential decay in time) fluctuations imply a simple relationship between the two fields. In essence ø controls the growth of the long wavelength fluctuations, and c modifies the interfacial profile. Asymptotically the dynamic structure factor (Sø(k,t)≡<Ø(k,t)Ø*(k,t)>) for the nonconserved field is shown to scale in the form Sø(k,t) = tdnfø(ktn), with n = 1/2.

By monitoring the Si-O infra-red (IR) bond-stretch mode frequency, it was found that at temperatures below 850°C, or at a oxygen poor composition near SiO0.8, the decomposition reaction only proceeded to a metastable form of SiO1.6 + Si. Characterization by Raman and spectroscopie ellipsometry confirm similar trends. Cross sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirms that Si nanocrystals (Sine) are formed with anneals at 900°C (30 sec). As deposited suboxides show band edge photoluminescence at 1.6 eV which disappears upon annealing at 900°C, indicating a sharp suboxide free interface between Sinc and SiO2 matrix.","chemistry_names":   [

All these films are deposited in a standard radio-frequency glow discharge system at low temperature (~200 °C). We show how the plasma synthesis of silicon nanocrystals, initially a side effect of powder formation, has become over the years an exciting field of research which has opened the way to new opportunities in the field of materials deposition and their application to optoelectronic devices. Our results suggest that epitaxy requires the melting/amorphization of the nanocrystals upon impact on the substrate, the subsequent epitaxial growth being favored on (100) c-Si substrates. As a consequence, the control of the impact energy is a critical aspect of the growth which will require new strategies such as the use of tailored voltage waveforms.","chemistry_names":   [

It is shown that incoherent dark field signals, such as those obtained by hollow-cone illumination in the CTEM, and the annular detector in the STEM, are significantly more sensitive to subnanometer size clusters than the bright field signal. Sensitivity to clusters of high atomic number increases as the illumination (or detector) semi-angle increases, although at the expense of decreased signal-to-noise. The STEM annular detector signal offers advantages over the CTEM hollow-cone signal in this respect since it has a higher electron collection efficiency. A further advantage of the STEM is that image contrasts may be enhanced by electronically combining the annular detector signal with the axial energy loss signal. This ratio method, or Z contrast technique, has been used with success to detect single Pt atoms on thin low atomic number supports.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"We have investigated the stability of luminescence in pure water from a nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) particles passivated with various chemical elements such as a hydrogen, carbon and oxygen atoms. Each sample emitted red light with a peak wavelength in a range from 690 to 800 nm. When the hydrogen- and/or carbon-passivated samples were immersed in pure water, the intensity of red luminescence was decreased by aging after a short period of time. At the same time, the peak wavelength was also shifted toward shorter wavelength. These were caused by the generation of defects (Pb-centers) and the reduction of particle size due to the desorption of hydrogen and/or carbon atoms and the replacement from the Si-H and/or Si-C bonds to the Si-O bond, respectively, at the surface of nc-Si particles. On the other hand, the oxygen-passivated sample showed stable luminescence in addition to the slight blue-shift of peak wavelength under the immersion in pure water for 400 hours. The good stability was attributed to the formation of stable surface condition. These results are a strong indication that the stability of the luminescence in pure water can be remarkably improved by the oxygen-passivation to the surface of nc-Si particles.","chemistry_names":   [

In this study W-5 wt% Re foil in both an as rolled and annealed condition was implanted with 2MeV W+ ions to two damage levels, 0.07 and 0.4 dpa. The change in hardness was measured using nanoindentation. An increase in hardness was seen in both materials at both damage levels, with more hardening seen for the 0.4 dpa implanted samples. However the increase in hardness due to ion implantation was 2.6 times higher in the annealed material as compared to the as rolled material. This is due to the smaller grain size and higher dislocation density providing more sinks for the irradiation produced defects in the as rolled material as compared to the annealed material. Thus showing that unannealed tungsten foils are superior for use in applications in which they will see significant levels of radiation damage.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"CIGS nanoparticles for the CIGS absorber layer have been synthesized by low temperature colloidal routes. The CIGS absorber layers for solar cells have been prepared by spray deposition of CIGS nanoparticle precursors (∼20 nm) in glove box under inert atmosphere. An automatic air atomizing nozzle spray system with computer controlled X-Y step motor system was used to spray. The nanoparticle precursor CIGS film was deposited onto molybdenum-coated soda-lime glass substrates (2.5 cm × 5.0 cm) heated to 160°C. The film thickness in the range of 2 μm ± 0.3 μm was attained by spraying of 3 mM colloidal over an area of 12.5 cm2. The coalescence between particles was observed in the CIGS absorber layer under post-treatment of over 550 °C. This is related to the reactive sintering among the nanoparticles to reduce surface energy of the particles. The CuxSe thin film, formed on Mo film by evaporation, improved adhesion between CIGS and Mo layers and enhanced the coalescence of the particles in the CIGS layer. These are closely related to the fluxing of Cu2Se phase which has relatively low melting temperature. The CdS buffer layer was deposited on the CIGS/Mo/soda-lime glass substrate by chemical bath deposition. The CIGS nanoparticles-based absorber layers were characterized by using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM).","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Short-bandgap group II-VI compound cadmium telluride is widely used for the infrared optics, radiation detectors, and solar cells where p-type CdTe is needed. p-type conductivity of CdTe is mainly caused by the chlorine-based A-centers, and in part, by the less stable copper-oxygen complexes. As a rule, CdTe films are recrystallized by the help of a cadmium chloride flux that saturates CdTe with chlorine. In chlorine-saturated CdTe A-centers are converted to isoelectronic complexes that cause resistivity increasement of CdTe up to 9 orders of magnitude. Excess copper and oxygen or group I elements as sodium also deteriorate the p-type conductivity of CdTe like excess chlorine. p-type conductivity of CdTe can be restored e.g. by the vacuum annealing which removes excess chlorine from the film. Unfortunately, treatment that betters p-type conductivity of the CdTe film degrades the junction of the superstrate configuration cells. In this work we investigate possibilities to prepare p-type CdTe films on the molybdenum coated glass substrates. Samples were prepared by the vacuum evaporation and dynamic recrystallization of 6N purity CdTe on the top of Mo-coated glass substrates. Then samples were recrystallized with cadmium chloride flux under tellurium vapour pressure. Results of the test studies on the structure and electronic parameters of samples are presented and discussed.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"For centuries, the manipulation of mechanical properties for the development of components has been extremely important. Its relevance is based on improving the service life in the components. The aim of some techniques that have been used is to introduce strain hardening (tensile) and a beneficial residual stress field. Nevertheless, the application of both methods is very common when the component is manufactured, but the lack of knowledge of the final physical state of the material could compromise the structural integrity of the final product. This work presents a numerical evaluation concerning the characterization of a stainless steel AISI 316L, having a homogeneous axial history and a residual stress field. The relevance of the work is focused in a new methodology that can be used to improve the mechanical resistance of the component and to arrest crack propagation. By altering the mechanical properties of the material, it could be possible to delay nucleation and interrupt the propagation of cracks. This study also shows that if the strain hardening behaviour and the introduction of the residual stress field is not done properly, it could result in a component susceptible to fail. In the same sense, bending tests are proposed to provide tensile and compressive stress profiles.","chemistry_names":   [

The DaSCS thermoset has excellent thermo-oxidative stability as determined by a low weight loss and tough residue after annealing 100 hours in air at 316°C, however the glass transition is a low 94°C. DaS and 90/10 thermosets do not undergo glass transitions below 350°C and have low weight losses on thermo-oxidative aging, however the residue was quite brittle.

Proteins are the key link between the processes of information and replication that take place on a genetic level and the infrastructure of living features. Understanding the properties of proteins is the key to understanding the spark of the life. In this paper we describe our study of various electrical properties of protein when performing measurements at the nanoscale. To achieve this goal we designed and fabricated a nanoelectronic probe. This nano structure consists of four thin film layers. There are two conductive layers and an insulative layer in between. There is also a protective oxide layer as the top most layer. This layer is to prevent the exposure of conductive electrodes to the solution. Underneath the bottom electrode, there is another oxide layer, which can be a thermally grown oxide. This layer insulates the first electrode from the substrate. In this study, while we use non-specific detection of streptavidin protein as a proof of concept, we emphasize that the findings of this study can be extended to specific detection of target proteins, where in this case a specific probe molecule would also be immobilized on the sensor surface.","chemistry_names":   [

A comprehensive way to treat both effects in one model is given by the time dependent Ginzburg Landau model or phase field model. The paper presents the application of a multi phase field model, recently developed for solidification processes to grain growth of a multicrystalline structure. The specific feature of this multi phase field model is its ability to treat each grain boundary with its individual characteristics dependent on the type of the grain boundary, its orientation or the local pinning at precipitates. The pinning effect is simulated on the nanometer scale resolving the interaction of an individual precipitate with a curved grain boundary. From these simulations an effective pinning force is deduced and a model of driving force dependent grain boundary mobility is formulated accounting for the pinning effect on the mesoscopic scale of the grain growth simulation. 2-D grain growth simulations are presented.","chemistry_names":   [

The 2004 ITRS Roadmap underlines the need of dielectric material for ILD with dielectric constant (k) lower than 3 for the 90 nm node and than 2.4 for the 45 nm node. In this work, porous films with k value lower than 2.2 were processed using a porogen approach. Firstly, a material composed of a methylsilsesquioxane (MSQ) matrix and of organic nanoparticles (called porogen) is deposited and baked. Then, this composite is thermally cured to allow the porogens degradation and matrix crosslinking. Different k values were obtained by varying the porogen loading in the composite. Mechanical properties of composite and porous films (before and after porogen removal respectively) were investigated using nanoindentation and FTIR analysis for different porogen loadings (between 0 and 40 %). The composite modulus is higher than the porous film modulus for high porogen loading. This result is interpreted in term of matrix crosslinking. Mechanical properties were also modelized using foam mechanical models. For high porosity level, the best Young modulus fitting is obtained with tetrakaidecaedric cells, which seems in good agreement with porosity morphology.","chemistry_names":   [

The maximum values of S(0°) and S(90°) were observed near the N/Fe atomic ratio of 0.2. At the similar atomic ratio, the differential relative intensity, S(0°)- S(90°), and the differential resonance field, H,(0°)-H,(90°). associated with the degree of magnetic interaction between the produced compounds, also showed maxima.

The parametric study of the deposition temperature shows an optimal value at about 220°C, leading to an efficiency of 16.4 % which is a technological breakthrough. The analysis of the device shows that indium sulfide layers give an improvement of the blue response of the cells as compared a standard CdS processed cell, due to a high apparent band gap (2.7-2.8 eV), higher open circuit voltages (up to 665 mV) and fill factor (78 %).

These natural composites are therefore substantial source of inspiration for emerging synthetic materials. In order to gain new insights into structureperformance relationships of these staggered structures, nacres from four species were compared in terms of fracture toughness and damage propagation pattern. Fracture tests revealed that all nacres display rising crack resistance curves, but to different extents. Using in-situ optical and atomic force microscopy, two distinct patterns of damage propagation were identified in columnar and sheet nacre respectively. These two different patterns were further confirmed by means of large scale numerical models of staggered structures.

The clusters, prepared by controlled hydrolytic iron polymerization reactions, contain a ∼ 1.2 nm diameter magnetic core of spin-coupled iron ions surrounded by a shell of benzoate ligands. The nanoparticles, prepared via sol-gel synthesis, contain a ∼ 4.0 nm average diameter γ-Fe2O3 core coated by a shell of SiO2. Both systems exhibit magnetic bistability at low temperatures with estimated magnetic anisotropy constants of Keff = 0.63x105 J/m3 for the clusters and Keff = 0.55 ×105 J/m3 for the particles. The similar values of Keff indicate that these two systems experience similar degrees of strain at the core/shell interface. This is further supported by the values of the quadrupole splitting, ΔEQ=0.77 mm/s for the clusters and ΔEQ=0.75 mm/s for the particles, pointing to same degree of distortion from pure octahedral or tetrahedral symmetry at the iron coordination sites for either system.

In this apparatus the fiber was going through the entire specimen, which made it possible to determine the point of complete debonding. To control the embedment length a plastic tube was inserted around the fiber. The described fiber pullout test method coupled with an appropriate analysis provides a quantitative determination of interfacial properties which are relevant to toughening of brittle materials through fiber-reinforcement. The technique was used on a high strength cement-based matrix called the Densified Small Particle system (DSP), and on an ordinary strength matrix. Other parameters investigated included fiber embedment length and fiber volume fraction in the cement matrix. The results indicate that: (1) the dense DSP matrix has significantly improved interfacial properties as compared to the ordinary strength matrix; (2) the major energy of pullout in both systems is due to sliding; and (3) both the debonding energy and sliding energy increase with fiber embedment length. These results are important in the understanding of the role of steel fibers in improving the tensile properties of high performance fiber reinforced composites.","chemistry_names":   [

Two series of samples were prepared at the substrate bias of Vb = −25 V and −100 V to modify growth texture of individual layers and verify its influence on the formation of coherent structures. XRD and TEM observations showed that in large period films (tc ≥ 30 nm) each constituent grows under its own kinetic, leading to the formation of nano-crysatlline film randomly oriented with no pronounced texture. Decreasing progressively the layer thickness favours the alignment of (0002) basal plane of w-AlN on (111) plane of TiN, and results in development of strong (111) texture, prerequisite for stabilisation of c-AlN and the formation of epitaxial coherent structures. The degree of crystallographic coherence was found to be higher in TiN(111) oriented films than for TiN(002) textured films. The increase of hardness coincides with the structure transition from a randomly oriented nanocrystalline films to a highly (111) textured multilayers, and the maximum hardness was obtained for epitaxially coherent nanolayers.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"The mid-infrared wavelength region offers a plethora of possible applications ranging from sensing, medical diagnostics and free space communications, to thermal imaging and IR countermeasures. Hence group IV mid-infrared photonics is attracting more research interest lately. Sensing is an especially attractive area as fundamental vibrations of many important gases are found in the 3 to 14 μm spectral region. To realise group IV photonic mid-infrared sensors several serious challenges need to be overcome. The first challenge is to find suitable material platforms for the mid-infrared. In this paper we present experimental results for passive mid-infrared photonic devices realised in silicon-on-insulator (SOI), silicon-on-sapphire (SOS), and silicon on porous silicon (SiPSi). Although silicon dioxide is lossy in most parts of the mid-infrared, we have shown that it has potential to be used in the 3-4 μm region. We have characterized SOI waveguides with < 1 dB/cm propagation loss. We have also designed and fabricated SOI passive devices such as MMIs and ring resonators. For longer wavelengths SOS or SiPSi structures could be used. An important active device for long wavelength group IV photonics will be an optical modulator. We present relationships for the free-carrier induced electro-refraction and electro-absorption in silicon in the mid-infrared wavelength range. Electro-absorption modulation is calculated from impurity-doping spectra taken from the literature, and a Kramers-Kronig analysis of these spectra is used to predict electro-refraction modulation. We have examined the wavelength dependence of electro-refraction and electro-absorption, and found that the predictions suggest longer-wave modulator designs will in many cases be different than those used in the telecom range.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Garnet phosphors have potential for use in field emission displays (FEDs). Greenemitting Gd3Ga5O12:Tb (GGG:Tb) and Y3A15012:Tb (YAG:Tb) are possible alternatives to ZnO:Zn, because of their excellent resistance to burn, low-voltage efficiency, (3.5 Im/W from GGG:Tb at 800 V), and saturation resistance at high power densities. Hydrothermal and combustion synthesis techniques were employed to improve the low-voltage efficiency of YAG:Tb, and Y3Ga5O12:Tb (YGG:Tb). Synthetic technique did not affect low-voltage (100\u20131000 V) efficiency, but affected the particle size, morphology, and burn resistance. The small particle size phosphors obtained via hydrothermal (<1 µm) and combustion reactions (<1 µm) would benefit projection TV, high-definition TV (HDTV), and heads-up displays (HUDs), where smaller pixel sizes are required for high resolution.","chemistry_names":   [

It is shown that removal of templating organics with thermal annealing leads to formation of mechanically robust and chemically very stable material, while application of UV-assisted curing with broadband lamp (λ > 200 nm) causes pronounced decrease of film ability to sustain in diluted HF solution.

 {"abstract":"The requirements for future ferroelectric non-volatile memories (FRAM) include lower operating voltages, higher densities and tighter design rules. In order to achieve these requirements the key component of the FRAM device, viz., the PbZrxTi1划xO3 (PZT) thin film capacitor must be scaled dimensionally to obtain reduced film thickness and capacitor area. This paper presents the ferroelectric performance of RF magnetron sputtered PLZT thin films with thickness scaled down to 1000Å. The switching performance of the thickness scaled PLZT thin films meets the requirements of 1.8V FRAM device. Though PLZT ceramic thin films, of which the fatigue is often a concern, are utilized as non-volatile component, excellent fatigue performance was observed. The scaled PLZT thin film capacitors are fatigue free up to 1011 fatigue cycles (E=200kV/cm). The scaled 1000Å PLZT thin films also showed good imprint performance. The opposite-state charge after 10 years baking at 150°C was still above the sensing level. The thickness scaled PZT thin films, showing dramatically improved ferroelectric performance, can be applied to the manufacturing of low voltage FRAM products.","chemistry_names":   [

Accurate thickness control of a-Si:H p-i layers with a precision better than ± Å has been realized by this technique. From real-time attenuated total reflection spectroscopy (ATR), we find the formation of a porous interface layer with a maximum SiH2-hydrogen content of 27 at.% at the a-Si:H/c-Si interface, although a rather high conversion efficiency of 14.6 % has been obtained in the solar cell. We found that an optimum i-layer thickness for the a-Si:H/c-Si solar cells is consistent with the thickness at which the a-Si:H i-layer growth reaches a steady state after the H-rich interface-layer formation. We have applied SE further to determine the dielectric functions of In2O3:Sn and ZnO:Ga with different carrier concentrations. From the dielectric function analysis, the effective mass m is extracted. We find linear increases in m as the carrier concentration of In2O3:Sn and ZnO:Ga increases. The validity of our analyses has been confirmed from excellent agreement between carrier concentrations determined by SE and Hall measurements. The construction of the optical database further enabled us to calculate a reflectance spectrum of the a-Si:H/c-Si solar cell accurately.","chemistry_names":   [

Scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and Mossbauer spectroscopy demonstrated that this bulk material is comprised of nanometer-sized regions of iron compounds embedded in a vitreous alumina gel matrix. Magnetization data showed that in the as-cured condition these nanocomposites are paramagnetic at room temperature and become either superparamagnetic or ferromagnetic on cooling to 10 K. The magnetic susceptibility increased with the Fe content and with decreasing temperature. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility indicated the magnetic moment per Fe atom was 1.87 µB for the 10% Fe nanocomposite and that it increased linearly with composition to 1.96 µB for the 40% Fe material. Mössbauer effect data showed that subsequent treatment of these materials in a gaseous environment of hydrogen at elevated temperatures (T<400 C) changed the form of the iron in the magnetic regions.

 {"abstract":"Fe/Ce multilayers are magnetically soft with coercive fields of a few Oersteds. In these structures the Ce-5d states are magnetically polarized by hybridization with the 3d states of Fe. The element selectivity of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) is used to measure the magnetization reversal of the Ce-5d states at room temperature. Comparison with the macroscopic magnetization curves studied by the magnetooptical Kerr effect (MOKE) reveal that the ordered Ce-5d moment is not directly coupled to the overall Fe-layer magnetization: the coercitivity of the Ce hysteresis is reduced a factor of two. In view of previous 57Fe Mössbauer spectra this is attributed to an effect of the interface where nominally 1 atomic layer of Fe and Ce are intermixed. Magnetization reversal is initiated in this region due to a reduced magnetocrystalline anisotropy and then propagates into the Fe layers. This interpretation is supported by an experiment on a hydrided multilayer Fe/CeH2.6_6: In this case, there is no intermixing at the interfaces and the magnetization of the Ce-5d electrons follows the Fe-layer magnetization directly.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Bone is the substantial unit of human skeletal system, which supports the body and its movement. At the ultra-structure level, the bone matrix is a composite material consisting of bone mineral particles, which are mainly substituted, calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite, and collagen, which is a natural polymer. Bone serves as the template for developing bone replacement materials. Research on biomaterials analogous to bone was started in the early 1980s by incorporating bioactive particles into biocompatible polymers so as to produce bone substitutes. Over the last two decades, a variety of bioactive polymer matrix composites have been developed for tissue substitution and tissue regeneration. The bioactive phases in these composites are normally one of the calcium phosphates, especially synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) which closely resembles bone apatite and exhibits osteoconductivity. If enhanced bioactivity is required, bioceramics having higher bioactivity such as Bioglass® and A-W glass-ceramic can be used as the bioactive phase in the composites. For tissue replacement, bio-stable polymers such as polyethylene (PE) and polysulfone (PSU) are used as the matrix polymer. For tissue regeneration, natural, biodegradable polymers such as polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and chitin are used as matrices. Furthermore, mechanical as well as biological performance of a particular composite can be controlled by varying the amount of the bioactive phase in the composite, thus meeting specific clinical requirements. For bioactive ceramic-polymer composites, major influencing factors such as shape, size and size distribution of bioactive particles, mechanical properties and volume percentage of the bioactive phase, properties of the matrix polymer, distribution of bioactive particles in the matrix and the particle-matrix interfacial state should be controlled in order to obtain materials of desirable properties. Various techniques are used to evaluate the composites.","chemistry_names":   [

The compounds anodically bonded at room temperature show the strength of the breakage of the glass. Only a few seconds up to a few minutes at voltages of maximum 500 V are necessary for bonding. The glasses have a thermal expansion coefficient, which is not fitted to that of silicon. Therefore, stability of the bonded compounds is achieved only at temperature jumps up to 100 K in the case of bulk samples. For higher temperature jumps the probability of breakage increases continuously. It is possible to get thin films of these glasses with ac and dc magnetron sputter techniques for example on silicon.

A scanning graphite strip heater technique was used, with the Si islands connected (\u201cbridged\u201d) in the scanning direction by narrow Si strips. These strips generated a self-seeding effect in the crystalline growth, and the recrystallized Si islands were good quality SOI with <100> orientation as shown by x-ray and etch-pit analysis. Protuberances, film cracking and impurity segregation were greatly suppressed in this bridged island SOI as compared to defects normally observed in recrystallized continuous Si films on quartz. MOSFETs were fabricated in the SOI islands, using n-channel enhancement mode devices with a gate length of 5μm and a gate width of 50μm. The average carrier mobility measured on these SOI devices was 470 ± 70 cm2/V.s, which was twice as high as the mobility measured in MOSFETs fabricated concurrently in SOS. Good MOSFETs in the SOI islands showed a switching ratio of about 107 at 6V and a leakage of less than 2pA/μm.

 {"abstract":"Current polyamide 11 and 12 are lacking in fire retardancy and high strength/high heat resistance characteristics for fabricated parts that are required for performance driven applications. The introduction of selected nanoparticles such as carbon nanofibers (CNFs), combined with a conventional intumescent flame retardant (FR) additive into the polyamide 11/polyamide 12 (PA11/PA12) by melt processing conditions has resulted in a family of intumescent polyamide nanocomposites. These intumescent PA11 and PA12 nanocomposites exhibit enhanced polymer performance characteristics, i.e., fire retardancy, high strength, and high heat resistance and are expected to expand the market opportunities for resin manufacturers. The overall objective of this research is to develop improved PA11 and PA12 polymers with enhanced flame retardancy, thermal, and mechanical properties for selective laser sintering (SLS) rapid manufacturing. Arkema RILSAN® PA11 polymer was examined with CNFs and Clairant Exolit® OP 1230 intumescent FR additive. They were used to create a family of FR intumescent PA11-CNF nanocomposites. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to determine the degree of CNFs and intumescent FR additive dispersion in PA11. Injection molded specimens were fabricated for material properties measurements. Thermal stability of these polymer nanocomposites (PNs) was examined by TGA. Flammability and thermal properties of these PNs were obtained using the cone calorimeter, UL 94 test method, and heat deflection temperature.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Plastic deformation due to thermal stresses has been investigated for different metallic films deposited on Si or α-alumina substrates. We conducted post-mortem TEM and SEM investigations of samples that underwent thermal cycles in order to capture the microstructural changes imposed by thermal stresses. The ultimate goal is to determine the dominant plasticity mechanisms responsible for such changes. In-situ thermal cycles performed inside the TEM allowed direct and real-time observations of dislocation behaviour under stress. It is shown that dislocation density drops in Al/Si, Au/Si and in Cu/α-alumina thin film systems. Except in the case of pseudo-epitaxial Cu on sapphire, the interaction of dislocations with the interfaces (passivation, oxide, adhesion layer) is attractive and leads to the disappearance of interfacial dislocations. In this light, the generalized observation of high tensile stresses that arise in metallic films at the end of cooling is explained in terms of insufficient dislocation sources instead of classic strain hardening. Diffusional processes can substitute for a lack of dislocation, but the low relaxation strain rate that would be excpected should lead to high stresses during the cooling stages of thermal cycles.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"A sample of josephinite, a rock containing predominantly a Ni-Fe metallic phase, was evaluated as a natural metal analog to increase confidence in the assessment of waste package performance for the potential high-level radioactive waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The josephinite sample was characterized electrochemically in simulated groundwater environments using cyclic potentiodynamic polarization and potentiostatic tests. The passive surface layers formed potentiostatically were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These results were compared to those obtained with a synthetic Ni3Fe alloy with a chemical composition similar to that of josephinite. Electrochemical studies showed that josephinite exhibited passivity at a slightly higher pH than did the cast Ni3Fe alloy and was found to be slightly more susceptible to pitting corrosion. The passive films formed on the josephinite and the cast Ni3Fe alloy have a duplex structure consisting of an Fe-rich hydroxide outer layer and a Ni-rich oxide inner layer. Results obtained from this study provide an appropriate characterization of the environmental conditions leading to the passivity and localized corrosion of josephinite. Extended persistence of a stable passive film, however, is essential for the long-term stability of the josephinite sample. The relationship between the passive behavior and the formation of alteration layers needs to be established for assessing the survivability of josephinite.","chemistry_names":   [

Emphasis was placed on the role played by hydrogen during film growth. Hydrogen is found to govern the film formation process by promoting the reverse process, \u2018etching\u2019. By preferentially eliminating energetically unfavorable configurations during the film growth, hydrogen controls the atomic structure, hydrogen incorporation, and grain growth of the film. It affects the total hydrogen content in the film, as well as the way hydrogen is bonded to the silicon. Excessive hydrogen dilution, however, reduces the grain size by changing the columnar grain growth to a more spherical-like grain growth, and eventually eliminates film growth. With appropriate hydrogen dilution, plasma deposition was found to yield \u2018polycrystalline\u2019 silicon films which has a large distribution of grain sizes, with the largest grains being about 2000 Å.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"One of the main deficiencies in today\u2018s rapid tooling techniques is the capability of producing only near net-shape parts. Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) is a technique that enables the fabrication of true net-shape parts in just a few hours with only minimum postprocessing. The DMLS is a laser-based rapid tooling process developed in Europe by Rapid Product Innovations (formerly Electrolux Rapid Development Finland) and EOS GmbH Germany. Rapid Product Innovations was also the first to implement this technology to functional prototyping by using two proprietary bronze-based powders and a new steel-based powder. The technique enables the fabrication of tailored microstructures from porous matrix to near full density. Thus, functionally gradient structures can be fabricated, i.e. material is sintered to full density only where it is needed. This paper describes the philosophy of fabricating true net-shape mold inserts and metal components, but also concentrates on how to maintain the dimensional accuracy even after the post-processing. The study shows that even +/− 0.05 mm accuracy can be obtained. The results of the study also illustrate the beneficial effects of reduced layer thickness and post-processing on the surface roughness and mechanical properties as well as the suitability of various conventional and non-conventional coatings. With reduced layer thickness, the step-shaped effect of the layers was no longer visible. The surface was even further improved by shot peening and coating. In addition, case studies from injection molding, pressure die-casting and direct metal component fabrication are presented.","chemistry_names":   [

Both types of samples emitted characteristic 1.54 µm PL resulting from the intra-4f Er3+ transition 4I13/2→4I15/2. Under below-gap excitation the samples exhibited very similar 1.54 µm PL intensities. On the contrary, under above-gap excitation GaN: Er (SSMBE) showed ∼80 times more intense 1.54 µm PL than GaN: Er (MOMBE). In addition, GaN: Er (SSMBE) also emitted intense green luminescence at 537 nm and 558 nm, which was not observed from GaN: Er (MOMBE). The average lifetime of the green PL was determined to be 10.8 µs at 15 K and 5.5 µs at room temperature. A preliminary lifetime analysis suggests that the decrease in lifetime is mainly due to the strong thermalization between the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 excited states.

While each of these applications require that the sensor and associated packaging be tailored for that individual application, they all require sensitive detection. The sensing approach taken to meet these needs is the use of SiC as a semiconductor in a Schottky diode configuration due to the demonstrated high sensitivity of Schottky diode-based sensors. However, Schottky diode structures require good control of the interface between the gas sensitive metal and SiC in order to meet required levels of sensitivity and stability. Two examples of effort to better control the SiC gas sensitive Schottky diode interface will be discussed. First, the use of chrome carbide as a barrier layer between the metal and SiC is discussed. Second, we report the first use of atomically flat SiC to provide an improved SiC semiconductor surface for gas sensor deposition.

The depth profiles, which were obtained using 18O(ρ,α)15N nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), reveal both the bulk oxygen diffusion coefficients (D) and surface exchange coefficients (k). Bulk oxygen diffusion coefficients are consistent with an extrapolation to lower temperature of previously published results with an activation energy of 114 kJ/mol (1.2 eV).

Much higher exchange rates are observed with C18O2 than with 18O2 (over four orders of magnitude when compared to an extrapolation to lower temperatures of previously published results) with a measured activation energy of 152 kJ/mol (1.6 eV). This faster surface exchange rate enabled measurable 18O tracer profiles to be generated at lower temperatures than previously reported, further contributing to the understanding of YSZ material properties and bringing to light a possible order/disorder transition similar to that previously observed at 650°C.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"A preliminary device was investigated as a first step in making an on-chip electrical readout based on the semiconductor CdS for a novel 3-D optical data storage method. The optical data is stored in glass as subsurface nanometer size defects called voxels. These voxels display secondary harmonic generation (SHG) to 800 nm input light. The device begins with an indium tin oxide film on a glass substrate coated with a film of Al2O3. In this preliminary device the Al2O3 was patterned via optical lithography with a periodic array of 10 micron holes that were filled with electrodeposited CdS. X-ray diffraction, and energy dispersive X-ray analysis were used to characterize the CdS. The device operation depends on the ability of the CdS with a bandgap of 2.4 eV to detect the 3.1 eV SHG light from the voxels while remaining unresponsive to 1.6 eV input light. The electrodeposited CdS was found to absorb 400 nm light at least a factor of 10 times greater than 800 nm light. Light to dark photocurrent ratios of 15 to 63 were observed from the CdS pillars using a 150 W xenon broadband light source. A light to dark ratio of about one was found when a long pass optical filter allowed only wavelengths above 750 nm. Thus the 10 micron CdS pillars have detected 400 nm light while rejecting the 800 nm input light.","chemistry_names":   [

As a result, the exciton ground state energy in GaN/AlN quantum dots with heights larger than 3 nm exhibits a red shift with respect to bulk GaN energy gap. It is shown that the radiative decay time in GaN/AlN quantum dots is large and increases from 0.3 ns for quantum dots with height 1.5 nm to 1.1×103 ns for the quantum dots with height 4.5 nm. On the contrary, the electron and the hole are not separated in ZnO quantum dots. Moreover, a relatively thick \u201cdead layer\u201d is formed near the surface of ZnO quantum dots.

The structurally similar family of explosives, TATB, DATB, Picramide and TNB were the focus of this work. It has been found that the energy of shake-up transitions observed in x-ray photoelectron spectra of these molecules shows a linear relation with the explosive sensitivity. To the contrary, optical absorption maxima, dependant upon dipole selection rules display a trend opposite that intuitively expected in relation to ease of initiation. The shake-up transitions are governed by monopole selection rules, so that the transitions between initial and final states of the same symmetry are allowed. The forbiddeness of the excited state may favor proton transfer, bond breakage and free radical formation relative to de-excitation by returning to the ground state. Electronic excitations of this type are believed to be important to multiphonon up pumping. The Is core hole resulting from photoionization creates a central coulomb force that shrinks the orbitals, simulating conditions similar to those of high pressure or shock passage. These factors may be at the heart of the correlation between the shake-up promotion energy and explosive sensitivity.","chemistry_names":   [

A core principle is to have individuals from different disciplines be the ones not only to build concise modules, but also to share them with content developers in other disciplines under a common organized framework. This bottom-up approach is an efficient way of introducing new content in existing curricula, and is especially helpful in university environments that may have no comprehensive \u201cexperts\u201d in nanotechnology per se. Having individuals work together to develop bottom-up pieces from their own specialized fields provides a mechanism not only for curriculum enhancement but also for faculty professional development.

Topics span different aspects of nanoscale materials, phenomena, devices, and manufacturing, and the content is structured in a framework such that components may be packaged as modular entities.

 {"abstract":"The continued shift towards the integration of diverse functions into single chips and chip assemblies requires a new vision in microelectronic systems integration. Over the last decade or so, there has been a tremendous push towards systems on chip (SoC) approach for increased functionality. While systems on a chip has received much deserved credit for the size and cost reduction of many products, a true system on a chip solution has not been practical for a number of applications. In some cases, this is simply an issue of chip size, in others material compatibility (Si and GaAs), in yet others electrical compatibility (high voltage, RF, analog, with digital) and in some others the overall cost of integration on silicon, even if technically feasible. The need to combine diverse materials and technologies to achieve increased functionality with decreased size and weight, along with the ever present pressure for lower cost, has created the opportunity for new system level integration opportunities. Among the new concepts, system in a package (SiP) and system on a substrate (SoS) have received the most attention. System in a package is a natural extension of system on a chip concept. Currently, there are aggressive programs to develop SiP capabilities to allow rapid, cost effective design and fabrication of subsystem level packages. System on a substrate is an emerging concept based on the integration of technologies in a wide area of electronics. SoS will take the next step to the full system level (e.g. a monolithic radio). However, there is another important concept that seeks the same objective of system-level integration, but with a different set of drivers. In situations where the product is required to be a certain size (e.g. a display or a smart card), further size reductions of the components is no longer productive. This creates the opportunity for alternative technologies such as thin film transistors and plastic substrates. Integration of these technologies offers the potential for significant cost savings because of lower manufacturing costs, and light weight, wearable, flexible products by elimination of today's rigid substrates. Such technologies not only offer new capabilities, but also change the basic premise of the electronics industry. We could move from the microelectronics to the macroelectronics era. In this paper, we will present an overview of this diverse and emerging technology.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"ZnO bulk crystals can be grown by several methods. 1) From the gas phase, usually by chemical vapor transport. Such CVT crystals may have high chemical purity, as the growth is performed without contact to foreign material. The crystallographic quality is often very high (free growth). 2) From melt fluxes such as alkaline hydroxides or other oxides (MoO3, V2O5, P2O5, PbO) and salts (PbCl2, PbF2). Melt fluxes offer the possibility to grow bulk ZnO under mild conditions (<1000°C, atmospheric pressure), but the crystals always contain traces of solvent. The limited purity is a severe drawback, especially for electronic applications. 3) From hydrothermal fluxes, usually alkaline (KOH, LiOH) aqueous solutions beyond the critical point. Due to the amphoteric character of ZnO, the supercritical bases can dissolve it up to several per cent of mass. The technical requirements for this growth technology are generally hard, but this did not hinder its development as the basic technique for the growth of α-quartz, and meanwhile also of zinc oxide, during the last decades. 4) From pure melts, which is the preferred technology for numerous substances applied whenever possible, e.g. for the growth of silicon, gallium arsenide, sapphire, YAG. The benefits of melt growth are (i) the high growth rate and (ii) the absence of solvent related impurities. In the case of ZnO, however, it is difficult to find container materials that are compatible from the thermal (fusion point Tf = 1975°C) and chemical (required oxygen partial pressure) point of view. Either cold crucible (skull melting) or Bridgman (with reactive atmosphere) techniques were shown to overcome the problems that are inherent to melt growth.

 {"abstract":"The electrical effects associated with pulsed laser irradiation of thermal oxides of silicon were investigated. Three of the functions performed by thermal oxides are control of field effects, junction passivation and electrical isolation. Representative oxide thicknesses suitable for these applications were studied: ≈ 100 nm; ≈ 500 nm and ≥, 1.0 μm respectively. The oxides were irradiated by a repetitively Q-switched Nd 3+:YAG laser operated at the fundamental frequency. The key laser parameters of energy and power density were varied over a wide range, from no change to the onset of discernible change and irreversible damage. The range of energy densities over which the oxide was not electrically degraded was established for each thickness of the oxide. This range of energy densities is compared to the useful range of energy densities for annealing polysilicon and for activating an implant through an oxide. The electrical data was obtained using a mercury probe and through the analysis of a large number of MOS capacitors formed on the irradiated oxides. Parameters measured include: breakdown voltages, surface state charge densities and flat band voltages.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"The combination of arsenic and boron implantation with rapid thermal annealing (RTA) has been investigated to form shallow p-n junctions under a titanium silicide (TiSi2) metallization. The use of TiSi2 as a connection material can lead to the destruction of the junction if the kinetics of silicidation and doping are not well controlled. The purpose of this study is to better understand and control these kinetics, using far-from equilibrium processing such as ion implantation and RTA. The structures were characterized by Rutherford Backscattering Spectometry (RBS) for arsenic and silicide profiling, Secondary Ion Mass Spectometry (SIMS) for boron profiling, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and electrical sheet resistance measurements. Two procedures were investigated. Both involved the thermal reaction of Ti thin films, sputter-deposited with thicknesses ranging between 40 and 80 nm. In the first experiment, the as-deposited films were implanted with either 115 keV arsenic or 28 keV boron to form the junction, disperse the native oxide, and ion beam mix the Ti and Si. The films were then subjected to an RTA at 750°C for 15 to 60 seconds, which leads to TiSi2 formation in unimplanted films. Implantation was found to actually prevent TiSi2 formation. Ion transport calculations indicated that dopant pile-up at the interface might inhibit silicidation while higher energies and larger implant doses can more effectively ion beam mix Ti and Si. A more attractive solution consists of first forming TiSi2 from the as-deposited Ti by RTA, and then implanting to form the junction. This resulted in better control of the junction thickness. A sharp increase in the TiSi2 resistivity was found after implantation but the original value could be restored by a second RTA. This RTA also electrically activated the dopants and recrystallized the junction. The material properties of Ti/Si and TiSi2/Si under ion bombardment, RTA, doping, and conventional furnace annealing will be discussed.","chemistry_names":   [

The electrochemical process involved in the oxidative dissolution of copper was investigated by potentiodynamic polarization studies. Surface modification of copper was investigated using Xray photoelectron spectroscopy to understand the interaction of Cu-H2O2-glycine-ATA during CMP. In the absence of glycine and ATA, the copper removal rate is found to be high in a slurry with 5% H2O2 at pH 2, then it decreases with increasing pH and reaches the minimum at pH 6, it continuously increases at alkaline condition. In the presence of 0.01M glycine, the removal rate of copper decreases in acidic slurries while increases significantly in alkaline slurries. With the further addition of ATA, the copper removal rate was reduced. However, better surface planarity was obtained.

 {"abstract":"Transportcoe[ ]cients in charged media exhibit strong variations, according to the conditions of displacement of the particles. Electrical transport, characterized by the simultaneous displacement of positive and negative charges in opposite directions obeys Ohm's law, but its variation with concentration (non-ideality), depends on several types of interactions, whose time of establishment varies from picosecond to nanosecond. Several diffusion processes can occur: mutual diffusion, where ions move simultaneously in the same direction, keeping local elec- troneutrality, and self diffusion where individual ionic particles move separately. The variation of diffusion coefficients with concentration dependson non-ideality factors analogous to those occuring in conductance, and their experimental evidence is facilitated b y the availability of experimental tec hniquesowing different characteristic times of observation. This phenomenon is particularly noticeable for self-diffsuion coefficients, where the dynamical processes can be observed from the picosecond range (neutron quasi-elastic scattering), to millisecond (NMR) and to hour scale (radiactive tracers). The results are especially enhanced for porous charged media like ion exchanging membranes (nafions).","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"As microcomponents in engineered systems, biological muscles have unique advantages such as large force transduction, utilization of biochemical fuel, and self-assembly from single cells, over other inorganic actuators for biomedical engineering applications. Successful integration of muscles with inorganic fabricated structures and electronics promises the capability of precisely characterizing muscles' mechanical properties and fabricating self-assembled controllable autonomous structures powered by ubiquitous glucose. However, the use of extracted muscle tissue from animals on these devices is impractical and inefficient, as the tissues must be dissected and incorporated into each device by hand with crude interfaces between the biological tissue and inorganic materials. Integration of muscle with fabricated structures would be optimally achieved through self-assembling muscle cells on MEMS. The construction of self-assembled muscle-powered MEMS structures is complicated by the stringent requirements to spatially direct the cell growth, control the tight connection of these differentiated structures with MEMS structures, and enable the cells and the integrated hybrid freedom to move. Conventional and soft photolithography techniques have been extensively employed to pattern the growth of a variety of cell types and investigate their interaction with substrate in the micrometer level. However, all studies are only suitable for patterning static cells on an immobile surface, so a novel system of spatially patterning the contractible cells must be developed to enable the cells and the integrated hybrid devices to be free to move.","chemistry_names":   [

Near-field radiation from a ridge waveguide transducer is expressed in terms of power density quantities. This allows us to quantify the near-field radiation efficiency from the near-field transducer with respect to the input optical power. Finite element method (FEM), which is capable of modeling focused beams, is used to simulate various geometries involving ridge waveguides. The incident electric field near the focal region is determined using a Gaussian beam expression and Richards-Wolf vector field equations for low NA and high NA beams, respectively. First, the ridge waveguide transducer is placed at the focal point of an optical lens system. The maximum value of the absorbed optical power in the recording medium is 1.6*10-4 mW/nm3 for a 100 mW input optical power. Finally, the ridge waveguide is placed adjacent to a solid immersion lens but separated by a low-index dielectric layer. For this case, the maximum value of the absorbed optical power in the recording medium is 7.5*10-4 mW/nm3 for a 100 mW input optical power. The improvement in the transmission efficiency is a result of two factors: 1. Increased incident electric field over the transducer surface due to increased NA of the optical system, 2. Surface plasmon enhancement obtained by placing a low-index dielectric material between the solid immersion lens and ridge waveguide.","chemistry_names":   [

Silica seed particles (from 50 to 150 nm in diameter) were first surface-modified by the adsorption of an oxyethylene-based macromonomer. Then, emulsion polymerization of styrene was carried out in presence of these particles, the formation of polystyrene nodules being highly favored at the silica surface in such conditions. The ratio between the number of silica seeds and the number of growing polystyrene nodules appeared to be one of the key parameters to control the morphology of the final hybrid nanoparticles. When this ratio is close to 1, original hybrid dumbbell-like nanoparticles were mainly obtained.","chemistry_names":   [

We carried out the RT-NIL process for the fabrication of diamond nanopit arrays, using the diamond nanodot molds that we developed.

High doses of Mn ions (∼2\u20135×1016/cm 2) were implanted into single crystal CdTe and into ZnSe epilayers on GaAs, forming subsurface layers of Cdl.xMnxTe and Znl-xMnxSe alloys, respectively, with x∼0.15\u20130.22. Fluorescence extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements on these materials reveal that the Mn atoms in the CdMnTe and ZnMnSe layers, both as-implanted and annealed, have local environments similar to their corresponding bulk-grown DMS alloys. While the anion-cation distances (Ra-c) in the annealed samples are equivalent to those in the corresponding bulk-grown DMS, the Ra-c in the asimplanted samples are slightly larger (∼0.01Å) than those in the bulk-grown DMS. This is most likely due to the implantation damage in the as-implanted materials. Our results on the Ra-c of the ion beam synthesized layers deviate significantly from Vegard's law, but are consistent with the bimodal distribution model.

The presence of nanoscale pits and substrate bowing were also found. XRD measurements showed a variation in crystalline quality of the substrates with the FWHM of the (0002) rocking curve varying from 87 arcsec to 192 arcsec with some substrates showing multiple peaks in the rocking curve. Photoluminescence was used to measure the optical quality of the substrates and both band edge luminescence and yellow luminescence were found to vary greatly within one substrate as well as from substrate to substrate. After characterization of each individual substrate a 405 nm LED structure was grown using identical growth conditions on each substrate, in separate growth runs. A GaN template was included in each growth for consistency. The surface morphology and crystalline quality of the device structures were then measured. Following this devices were fabricated and tested for electroluminescence optical output power and current-voltage characteristics. The device characteristics and performance as related to starting substrate quality will be presented with respect to substrate surface morphology and crystalline structure.","chemistry_names":   [

ZrO2 films were deposited by both atomic layer deposition (ALD) and plasma enhanced ALD (PEALD) techniques using Zr t-butoxide and Zr(NEt2)4 as Zr precursors and oxygen as reactant gas. The XTEM images showed a randomly oriented polycrystalline structure of ZrO2 and amorphous characteristics of the interfacial layer. The calculated dielectric constant value of the ZrO2 films are about 10∼18 and these low values are believed due to the low dielectric constant interface layer. ZrO2 films deposited with oxygen plasma using Zr(NEt2)4 showed the leakage current of 3.12X10-9 A/cm2 at the gate bias voltage of -1.0 Volt with the equivalent oxide thickness value of 1.39 nm. ZrO2 films deposited with the oxygen plasma showed generally improved film quality with relatively low leakage current, small hysteresis and low carbon incorporation as well as the higher growth rate compared to the films deposited with the oxygen gas. Also, ZrO2 films deposited using Zr(NEt2)4 showed relatively improved film properties compared to the films deposited using Zr t-butoxide.

While all of these experimental approaches have yielded valuable insights, only ESR has afforded detailed atomic-scale structural characterizations. ESR spectra of two fundamental classes of defects in a-SiO have been knon since the 1956 work of Weeks. However, many crucial detaiis such as the 29Si and 17O hyperfine structures of these centers have been provided only within the past dozen years. From these results, it is known that the so-called E\u2032 center comprises an unpaired electron in a dangling tetrahedral orbital of a single silicon atom at the site of an oxygen vacancy; at least three variants of the E\u2032 center have been distinguished in a-SiO2. Two additional intrinsic defect types, the nonbridging oxygen hole center and the superoxide radical, have also been identified by ESR, these being relatively more prevalent in irradiated silicas of high and low hydroxyl contents, respectively. Recent theoretical developments have proven indispensible to the modeling of the E\u2032 centers and have yielded valuable insights on the superoxide defects.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Grain boundaries are known to be able to impede phonon transport in the material. In the thermoelectric application, this phenomenon could help improve the figure-of-merit (ZT) and enhance the thermal to electrical conversion. Bi2Te3 based alloys are renowned for their high ZT around room temperature but still need improvements, in both n- and p-type materials, for the resulting power generation devices to be more competitive. To implement high density of grain boundaries into the bulk materials, a bottom-up approach is employed in this work: consolidations of nanocrystalline powders into bulk disks. Nanocrystalline powders are developed by high energy cryogenic mechanical alloying that produces Bi(Sb)Te(Se) alloy powders with grain size in the range of 7 to 14 nm, which is about 25% finer compared to room temperature mechanical alloying. High density of grain boundaries are preserved from the powders to the bulk materials through optimized high pressure hot pressing. The consolidated bulk materials have been characterized by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscope for their composition and microstructure. They mainly consist of grains in the scale of 100 nm with some distributions of finer grains in both types of materials. Preliminary transport property measurements show that the thermal conductivity is significantly reduced at and around room temperature: about 0.65 W/m-K for the n-type BiTe(Se) and 0.85 W/m-K for the p-type Bi(Sb)Te, which are attributed to increased phonon scattering provided by the nanostructure and therefore enhanced ZT about 1.35 for the n-type and 1.21 for the p-type are observed. Detailed transport properties, such as the electrical resistivity, Seebeck coefficient and power factor as well as the resulting ZT as a function of temperature will be described.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"The models that have been successfully used to control the ductile-brittle transition in high strength structural steels are qualitative in nature, and address the microstructural control of the mechanisms of brittle fracture. The basic idea is incorporated in the \u201cYoffee diagram\u201d, which dates from the 1920's and attributes the ductile-brittle transition to the competition between deformation and fracture; the more difficult brittle fracture becomes, the lower the temperature at which ductile processes dominate. There are two important brittle fracture modes: intergranular separation and transgranular cleavage. The intergranular mode is usually due to chemical contamination, and is addressed by eliminating or gettering the contaminating species. There are also examples of brittle fracture that is due to inherent grain boundary weakness. In this case the failure mode is overcome by adding beneficial species (glue) to the grain boundary. Transgranular cleavage is made more difficult by refining the effective grain size. In high strength steel this is done by refining the prior austenite grain size, by interspersing islands of metastable austenite that transform martensitically under plastic strain, or by disrupting the crystallographic alignment of ferrite grains or martensite laths. The latter mechanism offers intriguing possibilities for future steels with exceptional toughness.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Strained-Si-On-Insulator (Strained-SOI) MOSFETs are one of the most promising device structures for high speed and/or low power CMOS. In realizing strained-Si MOS LSI, fabrication of strained-Si MOSFETs with small sizes are indispensable and thus, the investigation of the strain relaxation is an important issue. Therefore, the strain relaxation of strained-SOI mesa islands with small active area was investigated in this study. Thin strained-Si films were grown on thin relaxed SiGe-on-insulator (SGOI) structures (x=0.28). The isolation process was carried out by using chemical-dry-etching (CDE) to fabricate samples with small active areas. Using Raman spectroscopy with resolution of > 1 micron meter, strained-Si islands on SGOI substrates with the size of 5 micron meter square were investigated. Rapid-thermal-annealing (RTA) in N2 atmosphere was performed to study the strain relaxation during heating processes. As a result, it was confirmed that the strained-Si layers grown on relaxed SiGe (x=0.28) before and after mesa isolation, down to 5 micron meter in size, had almost no relaxation after the RTA process at 1000°C. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the nano-beam electron diffraction (NBD) measurement showed similar tendency regarding the strain relaxation.","chemistry_names":   [

This paper will present the in-situ measurement and analysis of stress development during the making of these films, from the onset of drying till the end of heating. The drying stress is measured by a cantilever beam technique; the thermal stress is measured by monitoring the wafer curvature using a laser deflection method. During the course of drying, the surfactant templated films experience a low drying stress due to the influence of the surfactant on surface tension and extent of siloxane condensation. The aerogel films first develop a biaxial tensile stress due to solidification and initial drying. At the final stage of drying where the drying stress vanishes, dilation of the film recreates the porosity of the wet gel state, reducing the residual stress to zero. For the surfactant templated films, very small residual tensile stress remains after the heat treatment is finished (∼30MPa). Aerogel film has almost no measurable stress developed in the calcination process. In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry analysis during drying and heating, and TGA/DTA are all used to help understand the stress development.","chemistry_names":   [

While machined and forged parts of CPTi, or Ti-6Al-4V, are suitable for many applications, they are not economical for one-off objects or artefacts of extreme intricacy. Titanium castings are an obvious solution to the problem but these are extremely difficult to process without contamination. Alloying allows a lowering of the melting point and significantly reduces the risk of contamination but the resultant alloys are normally brittle due to networks of intermetallics forming. This paper describes a process of semi-solid casting using a powder titanium feedstock for making one-off castings of artefacts like those required in dentistry. The process will be described and the mechanical and corrosion properties of several alloys which are compatible with this technique are assessed. The basic process is relatively inexpensive and provides a useful tool for examining a wide range of potential titanium base alloys.","chemistry_names":   [

The mean composition of individual SFs was measured for bulk specimens which had been equilibrated in the range 450-575°C. In addition, the composition was measured with a spatial resolution, within the plane of the SFs, of ~1 Å and with a spatial resolution of <4 Å perpendicular to the SFs. These measurements demonstrated the following: (a) The meancompostion of the SFs increased with decreasing temperature according to an Arrhenius-like expression; (b) The Nb or Fe concentrations fall off very quickly with distance--within <4 Å from the plane of the SF the bulk concentation is achieved; (c) The SFs equilibrated above 4500 C contained solute-atom fluctuations (≈5 to 20 \\ diameter) which correspond to compositions with stoichiometries of ≈Co2Nb or ≈Co3Fe. In the case of the Co(Nb) alloy, a transmission electron diffraction pattern was obtained ofa SF--with the electron beam normal to the SF--which exhibited superlattice reflections with six-fold symmetry around the hcp matrix reflections.

 {"abstract":"Diethylgermane, (CH3CH2)2GeH2, and germanium tetrachloride, GeCl4 may be useful precursors for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or atomic layer controlled deposition of germanium. To explore the surface chemistry of these alternative precursors, the adsorption and desorption kinetics of (CH3CH2)2GeH2 (DEG) and GeCl4 on Si(111) 7×7 have been examined using laser-induced thermal desorption (LITD), and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) techniques. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has also been employed to monitor the decomposition of DEG on porous silicon surfaces. The FTIR spectra revealed that DEG dissociatively adsorbs on porous silicon surfaces at 200 K to form SiH, GeH, and SiCH2CH3 surface species. No spectral features were observed for GeCH2CH3 surface species. The TPD studies following DEG exposures on Si(111) 7×7 observed CH2=CH2 and H2 desorption products at 700 and 800 K, respectively. The production of CH2=CH2 (ethylene) was consistent with a βhydride elimination mechanism from surface ethyl species, i.e. SiCH2CH3(ad) → SiH(ad) + CH2=CH2 (g). Similar TPD experiments following GeCl4 exposures monitored the desorption of only SiCl2 at approximately 920 K. Desorption of SiCl2 indicates that the chlorine on GeCl4 has transferred to the silicon surface. Atomic Ge was also observed to desorb at 1200 K following both DEG and GeCl4 adsorption. LITD experiments measured initial reactive sticking coefficients of So ∼0.05 for DEG and So ∼1.0 for GeCl4 at 200 K. As expected from a precursor-mediated adsorption model, the sticking coefficients decreased versus increasing surface temperature. The sticking coefficients for these germanium containing precursors were higher than the corresponding sticking coefficients for (CH3CH2)2SiH2 and SiCl4. Possible recipes for the CVD or atomic layer controlled deposition of germanium on silicon can be proposed based on the surface chemistry and adsorption and desorption kinetics for DEG and GeCl4.","chemistry_names":   [

Ba2Ca2Cu3Ox precursor films are deposited via metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) in a horizontal hot walled reactor. The second generation precursors Ba(hfa)2\u2022tet, Ca(hfa)2\u2022tet, and Cu(hfa)2 (hfa = hexafluoroacetylacetonate, tet = tetraglyme) were used as volatile metal sources due to their superior volatility and stability. Tl was introduced into the film via a high temperature post anneal in the presence of a Tl2O3:BaO:CaO:CuO pellet (1:2:2:3 ratio). Low O2 partial pressures were used to reduce the temperature in which the TI-2223 phase forms and to improve the surface morphology associated with a liquid phase intermediate. Films are highly oriented with the c-axis perpendicular to the substrate and a-b axis epitaxy is seen from x-ray φ- scans. The best films have a resistively measured Tc of 115K and a magnetically derived Jc of 6×105 A/cm2 (77K, 0 T).

With a specially designed quadruple reflection phase shifter we measured the MCD effect with Pcire<l as well as with Pcirc∼1.

The imprinting of Cr3+ in cross-linked siloxane network was investigated by FT-IR which indicates the metal ion is coordinated with oxygen atoms of polysiloxanes. SEM images revealed that imprinted polysiloxanes possess uniform particles of submicron size. It was experienced that by increasing the concentration of CPTM up to 10% (v/v) substantially improves the binding capacity of polysiloxanes which allows us to recognized Cr3+ down to 50µg/L. Furthermore, the selectivity of Cr3+-imprinted polysiloxanes was evaluated by treating them with other competing metal ions of same concentration i.e. Cr6+, Pb2+ and Ni2+. In this regard, polysiloxanes showed much higher binding for imprint ion i.e. Cr3+ in comparison to above mentioned metal ions.

Gas phase doping levels were 1%. At the lower temperatures the hydrogen concentration in the B doped and compensated doped films is larger than in the P and undoped films. For higher deposition temperatures the H concentration of the B doped films appeared to be smaller than in the other materials. The difference in hydrogen content of the doped and undoped material, deposited at various temperatures, is considered as a function of the measured activation energy for conduction in these films. This difference varies in much the same way with the activation energy as the hydrogen content in films deposited at one substrate temperature, but with varying gas phase dopant levels.

Above Vth the current increased almost linearly with bias, and the carrier transport changed from a semiconducting behaviour into a more conducting (metallic) state. The threshold voltage Vth was found to decrease with increasing temperature and disappear at 340 ∼ 350K, but recovered on reducing the temperature. The transition at Vth has been analysed in terms of electrothermal mechanism. The calculated turnover temperature is about 346K, close to that for the disappearance of Vth.

 {"abstract":"A polycrystalline silicon (pc-Si) thin film with large grains on a low-cost non-Si substrate is a promising material for thin-film solar cells. One possibility to grow such a pc-Si layer is by aluminum-induced crystallization (AIC) followed by epitaxial thickening. The best cell efficiency we have achieved so far with such an AIC approach is 8%. The main factor that limits the efficiency of our pc-Si solar cells at present is the presence of many intra-grain defects. These intra-grain defects originate within the AIC seed layer. The defect density of the layers can be determined by chemical defect etching. This technique is well suited for our epitaxial layers but relatively hard to execute directly on the seed layers. This paper presents a way to reveal the defects present in thin and highly-aluminum-doped AIC seed layers by using defect etching. We used diluted Schimmel and diluted Wright etching solutions. SEM pictures show the presence of intra-grain defects and grain boundaries in seed layers after defect etching, as verified by EBSD analyses. The SEM images of diluted Wright etched pc-Si seed layer shows that grain boundaries become much better visible than with diluted Schimmel etch.","chemistry_names":   [

The surface roughness of the N-polarity material appears to be caused by Ga-polarity inversion domains which lead the growth. A cathodoluminescence study showed that the N-polarity material is much brighter than the Ga-polarity material, suggesting a higher donor concentration, probably due to increased impurity incorporation in the [0001] growth direction or possibly due to an increase in intrinsic point defects.

The PZT films were deposited at different pressures and different substrate temperatures ranging from floating temperature to 400°; the thicknesses of the sputtered films were in the 15-720 nm range. The absolute and relative cation and oxygen compositions of the thin films were determined by a new method based on the simultaneous use of Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS) and Nuclear Reaction Analysis (NRA) induced by a deuteron beam. The total deposition rate and atomic ones are observed as a function of the substrate temperature and pressure.

 {"abstract":"Previous studies have helped elucidate the underlying mechanisms for selective area epitaxy in chemical beam epitaxy by investigating the reactions of triethylgallium (TEG) on a silicon nitride surface. However no explanation was produced as to why selective growth is lost at low temperatures or high Gp V beam fluxes. This question is addressed in this paper which examines the interaction between TEG and As2 on the silicon nitridesurface. In the absence of arsenic, TEG adsorbs with a low sticking probability on the dielectric. Adsorbed species mainly desorb rather than decompose, and any Ga produced on the surface becomes converted to a nitride form; no free Ga is produced hence GaAs growth cannot occur. Arsenic is found to form a weakly adsorbed phase on the nitride surface. Reaction with co-adsorbed TEG results in the formation of GaAs. Adsorbed As also is efficient in increasing the reactive sticking probability of TEG.The results provide further insight into the reaction mechanisms governing selected area epitaxy.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"The effect of twin/tilt initiated in the process of graphite growth making the graphite curling and change from flake to vermicular and spheroidal is discussed. With the developing of the solidification process,the modifying elements enrich in the front of solid-liquid interface, the amount of twin defects in the graphite increases,its tilt fashion changes and the graphite formed varies from flake to vermicular and spheroidal. The modifying elements promote the formation of twin/tilt. When the modifying elements are insufficient for spheroidizing,the tilt orientation of twins is changeable,and the graphite formed is twisted. When the modifying elements are sufficient enough, the tilt orientation of twins becomes singular, and the graphite formed tends to be round. According to the energy and kinetics consideration of the formation of twin/tilt boundary, it is predicted that the twin plane would firstly adopt (10Tm), especially the (10T2) plane. This result coincides well with the experimental observations. It is proposed that the formation of SG can be divided into two steps: growth of graphite nucleus into spherulite by twin/tilt mechanism and brancing on it in a spiral mode.","chemistry_names":   [

However, closer examination of how relaxation depends on thermal treatments reveals the complexity that might be expected from a disordered material. For example, the stabilization of many spins quenched in from 260°C can be increased by annealing at an intermediate temperature: It appears that, some 260°C defects equilibrating further at 205°C will relax and become more locked-in configurationally than defects simply equilibrated at 260°C. Crossover of annealing data is the result. Crossover cannot be explained with two-level system approaches. Models in which a spin can be stabilized with alternate structural configurations must be invoked.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Natural short-lived radionuclides generate electronic defects in minerals, such as trapped electrons and positive holes, often associated with element impurities, which act as final traps over geological periods. Two main examples will be illustrated. The first example will concern the point defects, which are observed in clay minerals. The high specific surface area makes clay minerals sensitive to the geochemical radiation background and provides a record of the past occurrence of radionuclides in geological systems. In kaolinite, three types of hole-centers are trapped by oxygen atoms linked to Si- or Al-sites. An experimental dosimetry gives the paleodose, which can be used either to assess mean past U-concentration or for kaolinite dating, depending on the available geochemical parameters. The detection of past migrations of radioelements in natural analogues may be used in the safety assessment of radioactive waste disposals. The second example will concern the role of mineral impurities in defect formation and stabilization. Natural fluorites (CaF2) exhibit hole-and electron-centers trapped on several rare earths and oxygen impurities, often present at the ppm level, which are responsible for the wide range of coloration observed in natural fluorites. Ca colloids may form under severe irradiation and give rise to a characteristic absorption. The thermal stability of radiation-induced defects gives constraints on the evolution of fluorites as a function of temperature and time. Other minerals, such as apatite, confirm the importance of impurities in stabilizing radiation-induced defects over geological periods.","chemistry_names":   [

For Br2 and Cl2 on Cu(100) and polycrystalline Cu, the etching mechanism could be characterized as a two step process: 1) formation of a bulk Cu(I) halide, and 2) removal of the halide by sublimation. In all cases the first step was found to be adsorption rate limited. Halide formation was observed to consume Cu atoms from the step edge and thus etching can be considered the reverse of step flow growth. While STM showed that Cl2 reacts isotropically with steps on Cu(100), the rate of CuBr formation was observed to be sensitive to the local adsorbate structure at the step edge. For Cl2, it was found that halide removal could be characterized as a simple bulk sublimation process independent of the structure of the underlying Cu. In contrast, a CuBr desorption peak at temperatures lower than anticipated from bulk vapor pressure data was observed. The presence of narrowly spaced steps on the Cu surface was observed to stabilize this low-temperature desorption peak.","chemistry_names":   [

The ionic strength of the supporting NaCl electrolyte, in equilibrium with atmospheric air, was either 0.002 M or 0.1 M. The apparent diffusivities derived from saturation-leaching experiments reveal that equilibrium adsorption on a negatively charged silica surface does not act to retard the mass transfer of sodium ions. The steady-state diffusion results are found to demonstrate the increasing break-through for sodium with decreasing ionic strength of the background electrolyte in comparison to 3H. These observations are consistent with the picture of chloride ion exclusion and of the diffuse double layer surface-excess for sodium ions being transported in the direction of the macroscopic concentration gradient. Furthermore, they are shown to be at odds with the widely adopted macroscopic pore diffusion model, which neglects the mobility of the counter-ion surface- excess.","chemistry_names":   [

Before the growth process, metal nanoparticles were scattered over the substrate surface by dipping it into a dispersion previously sonicated. The concentration of the dispersion (150, 300, 500 and 5000 ppm) controls the metal content into the carbon coating. The morphology of the deposited samples was analysed by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy). The metal content in the carbon films has been evaluated by SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy). The incorporation of low amounts of metal nanoparticles into the hard carbon coating produces an outstanding improvement in the durability of the layer, as detected by pin-on-disc tests. For an optimum chromium content of 300 ppm of nanoparticles in the dispersion, the grown layer exhibits a noteworthy higher wear resistance respect to that of the DLC reference film. More precisely, in this case, the Cr-DLC coating undergoes ten times longer wear process than the reference DLC coating. However, it is important to indicate that in samples grown using more concentrated dispersions (> 300 ppm), a rapid deterioration of the coating is produced and short lifetimes have been detected, attributed to the large contribution of metal to the transfer layer.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Surface effects produced by plasma processing Ultra High Molecular Weight polyethylene (UHMW) were examined. The goal was to enhance adhesion of UHMW to a variety of polar polymers. This research focussed on enhancing adhesion to polyurethane. UHMW samples were immersed in a DC discharge and subjected to various processing conditions. The background gases experimented with were oxygen, nitrogen, and argon, and the pressure was varied between 6-67 Pa. The processing time, discharge current and discharge potential were also varied. A polar polymer (polyurethane) was subsequently applied to the processed UHMW samples and the tensile strength of the bonds was measured. Standard dogbone specimens were fabricated, and the polymer interfaces placed in the middle of the gage section and oriented normal to the tensile axis. The specimens were tested to failure in displacement control at an approximate strain rate of 0.2% per sec. In general, significant enhancement in yield strength was observed over unprocessed samples, where essentially no bonding occurred. Samples subjected to plasma processing in oxygen showed the strongest adhesion, while those in argon were almost as good, followed by nitrogen.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Strained layer semiconductor structures provide possibilites for novel electronic devices. When a semiconductor layer is deposited epitaxially onto a single crystal substrate with the same structure but a slightly different lattice parameter, the semiconductor layer grows pseudomorphically with a misfit strain that can be accomodated elastically below a critical thickness. When the critical thickness is exceeded, the elastic strain energy builds up to a point where it becomes energetically favorable to form misfit dislocations. In the absence of a capping layer, surface roughening may also take place which causes strain relaxation in the form of 2D ridges or islands via surface diffusion. At sharp valley regions on the surface, amplified local stresses can cause further defect nucleation and propagation. These defects can be detrimental to the electrical performance of devices by acting as electron-hole recombination centers or current leakage channels. In this paper, we present observations and analyses of two novel defects nucleated in heteroepitaxial Si1−xGex thin films through surface roughening. Heteroepitaxial films 500 Å thick and containing 22% Ge are deposited by LPCVD. These initially flat films are subjected to various annealing conditions in a H2 atmosphere to induce morphological evolution and defect formation. High resolution transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy have been used to study the morphology of defects at the film surface and at the film/substrate interface.","chemistry_names":   [

With bias voltage ~ 1.2V/μm, the field emission properties of the carbon nanotubes are improved by exposing the nitrous oxide while the bias effect with water exposure is less significant.

Spiking into the Si and voids in the Ge film are observed after the anneal. This is attributed to defect-assisted Ge diffusion into the Si substrate caused by strain at the Ge-Si interface. Simple diffusion theory using published diffusivity values predicts diffusion depths similar to the spiking depths observed by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Approaches to reduce the strain at the interface are explored. It is found that the quasi-equilibrium nature of FA reduces spiking and that there is an area dependence.

Coated steels using the aforementioned method are exposed to high temperature 800\u20131000°C and their oxidation behavior is investigated. It is found that the nanoceria particles in the implemented coatings exhibit some growth during high temperature exposure. In addition, thermogravimetric determinations of oxidation resistance in coated and bare samples at 900°C clearly indicates that the nanoceria coated stainless steels exhibits a two fold reduction in mass gain when compared with bare ones. Optical and scanning electron microscopy are employed to characterize the developed oxide scale morphologies. It is found that in areas are nanoceria is not uniformly coated, Fe-rich oxide islands develop, whereas in coated regions the scale is Cr and Ce rich indicating that the scale is probably a Ce doped Cr oxide.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"LiFePO4/C composite cathode materials were synthesized by one-step solid-state reaction using FePO4 as main raw materials and solid PVA (Polyvinyl Alcohol) as a reductive agent and carbon source. The sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), particle size analysis and charge-discharge test. The results indicated that the carbon generated from the pyrogenation of PVA did not affect the olivine structure of the cathode materials but considerably improved its high-rate discharge ability and cycle performance. The initial discharge capacity of the sample was 149.7, 133.1, 120.6, 93.0 mAh/g at 0.2C, 1C, 2C, 5C respectively, and the discharge capacity could reach 90 mAh/g at 5C rates after 80 cycles.

 {"abstract":"A method was proposed to generate flat-top polygonal temperature distributions in substrates from a Gaussian-shaped laser source. The original Gaussian beam is equally and diametrically separated into several portions and is then rearranged so that the each portion has its peak intensity allocated toward outside. This can be realized by a symmetrical multi-facet prism. A mathematical model was derived to calculate the temperature rise induced the rearranged portions of the laser beam. Flat-top polygonal temperature profiles with two, three, four and six corners have been investigated by numerical calculations. It is shown that flat-top polygonal temperature distributions can be obtained by this method if the distance between the peaks of the beam portions is arranged to be certain proportions to the original Gaussian beam. It is also found the shape of the temperature profile is almost with the same size as the original Gaussian beam size and does not depend on the incident laser power and the substrate material.","chemistry_names":   [

We develop quantitative measures of the accuracy and convergence of the method by considering a comparison with known analytical solutions. It is shown that the method displays absolute convergence with increasing the number of quadrature points on the dislocation loop and the surface mesh density. For example, at a distance of one lattice parameter from the surface, the relative error is less than 5% for a surface mesh with an element size of 1000 × 2000 lattice parameters, and 64 quadrature points. The Eshelby twist in a finite length cylinder containing a coaxial screw dislocation is also used to benchmark the method. Simulation results of single slip behavior in cylindrical microcrystals is presented, and the general features are compared to single-crystal compression experiments.

The approach utilized full potential of complexation for the first time by using aqueous electroplating solutions containing complexing agents at alkaline regime. Complexing agents were employed to solubilize In and Ga ions at high pH and to bring their reduction potentials down, closer to that of Se. Since no appreciable complexation occurred between Se and the complexing agents, Se reduction potential could be independently controlled by the amount of dissolved Se. Tartrate and citrate were determined to be suitable complexing agents for In and Ga. By optimizing the concentrations of the metal salts, the complexing agents, the selenium source, pH and the electrodeposition current density, it was possible to obtain adherent and smooth In-Se and Ga-Se films with high repeatability and controllable In/Se and Ga/Se molar ratios.","chemistry_names":   [

As a result we can now predict the detailed time- and temperature-dependent supersaturation of interstitials during thermal evolution of these defects. This opens the way to predictive simulation of transient enhanced diffusion and dose loss in preamorphized ultrashallow junctions, where dopant movement is driven by free interstitials emitted by self-interstitial \u201cend-of-range\u201d defects.

Field ion images and atom probe analyses revealed segregation of zirconium to dislocation strain fields and ribbon-like morphological features that are probably related to dislocations. These results provide direct experimental evidence in support of the suggestion that the tremendous increase in the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) in zirconium-doped NiAl is due to pinning of dislocations by zirconium atoms. Atom probe analyses also revealed segregation of zirconium to grain boundaries. This result is consistent with the change from an intergranular fracture mode in undoped NiAl to a mixture of intergranular and transgranular fracture mode in zirconium-doped NiAl. The NiAl matrix was severely depleted of the solutes molybdenum and zirconium. Small Mo-rich precipitates, detected in the matrix and grain boundaries, are likely to contribute to the significant increase in the room-temperature yield stress of microalloyed NiAl through a precipitation hardening mechanism.","chemistry_names":   [

Both time-of-flight spectra at the incident angle of 45.0°C along [ 100] azimuth and of 35.3°C along [110] azimuth revealed Ti and weak O peaks and no Sr peak at 150°C, which means that the topmost layer at 150°C is terminated by TiCh-plane, completely. On the other hand, as increasing the substrate temperature, Sr peak began to appear above 400°C. This Sr peak intensity from both directions was drastically increased with elevating the substrate temperature. This indicates that the topmost O and Ti atoms desorb from the surface at the higher substrate temperature. The ratio Sr/Ti corresponds to the amount of the topmost oxygen or titanium vacancies due to the desorption. It was found that 40 % of the topmost oxygen atoms and 32% of the topmost titanium atoms desorb from TiO2-terminated SrTiO3(001) surface at 800°C.

SiNWs also open the possibility for integrating optoelectronics with microelectronics, since silicon has semiconducting properties and amorphous silicon nanowires have been shown to emit blue light. It has been demonstrated that SiNWs have tunable electrical properties, depending on the dopant used. With such a range of applications, the ability to mass-produce silicon nanowires simply and easily with no other source of silicon needed other than the substrate itself will prove very useful. Such methods have previously been reported, but our method involves production of the SiNWs at a lower temperature than those widely observed. A (100) silicon substrate was cleaned for five minutes each in ethanol followed by acetone. Films with thicknesses of less than 20 nm of either gold or 60/40 gold/palladium were deposited on the substrate through physical vapor deposition to serve as the growth center for the SiNWs. The samples were placed in a furnace and annealed to 900° C, under a 1500 sccm flow of argon at atmospheric pressure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used for characterization of the SiNWs. The resulting SiNWs were amorphous in structure and very convoluted, with lengths on the order of tens of microns, diameters of 40 nm and a bed thickness of approximately 10 m. The effect of varying gold concentration, annealing time, temperature, and gas flow rate were then investigated. The results, which will be discussed in further detail, indicate that adjusting these parameters allows for control over the length, thickness, density, and morphology of the nanowires.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"The self-consistent one-electron wave functions and energy bands obtained by the LMTO-ASA method within the local density approximation (LDA) are used to calculate the wave vector and frequency dependent non-interacting spin susceptibility of paramagnetic La2CuO4 in the body-centred tetragonal (bct) structure. We show that the tendency towards the antiferromagnetic instability is strongly dependent on the effects of the matrix elements which lead to a substantial depression of the susceptibility, especially near the X-point. The Fermi surface nesting properties, although important for the susceptibility, are by far not sufficient for the instability and the interband transitions turn out to be of great significance. Our results indicate that the susceptibility is at least 3 times too small to drive this system through a transition to the antiferromagnetic state, and we discuss possible reasons for this failure.","chemistry_names":   [

However, many diamonds also contain defects configurations (groups of threading dislocations originating from a secondary phase region or inclusion) in the bulk of the wafer which map well to regions of photoconductive gain, indicating that these inclusions are a source of electron trapping which affect the performance of diamond X-ray detectors. It was determined that photoconductive gain is only possible with the combination of an injecting contact and charge trapping in the near surface region.

The microstructure of discharged-produced, hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) appears to be strongly affected by the presence of impurities in the discharge atmosphere. A model is developed in which impurities create microvoids in a-Si:H, and traps, recombination centers and metastable centers are associated with the internal surfaces of the microvoids. In this model, hydrogen plays an important role in determining the electronic activity and diffusivity of impurities, and metastable centers are created by the trapping of holes near microvoids and the induced motion of hydrogen on the internal surfaces of the microvoids.","chemistry_names":   [

Our main goal in this study was to compare the MD predictions to models of ion-assisted etching involving the concept of a site balance. For the case of 50 eV Cl+ etching silicon, the coverage vs. exposure results in the simulation could be reasonably well reproduced in a site balance model, but only if the correct parameters in the model were taken from the simulation.

 {"abstract":"Fluctuation electron microscopy studies have been performed on several aluminum oxides exposed to different electrochemical conditions. Little is known about amorphous aluminum oxide structures and their relationship with their passivation behaviors. Corrosion studies have shown that exposure of aluminum oxide films to Cl ions in solution reduces the oxide's passivity, and this results in the onset of pitting corrosion. The physical changes that occur in the oxide as a result of Cl exposure have not been previously identified due to the difficulty in investigating the structure of this amorphous material. Fluctuation microscopy is a new electron microscopy technique that is able to detect the presence of medium range order structures in amorphous systems. In this paper, we will report fluctuation microscopy results on amorphous aluminum oxides that have been exposed to Cl ions in solution and compare them with oxides that have seen no electrolyte exposure or that have been exposed to electrolytes that do not contain Cl-,such as SO42- containing electrolytes. We will also compare the Cl-exposed oxides with oxides that have been implanted with Cl ions. The differences in pitting behaviors for these oxidesare consistent with our previous speculation on the effect of medium range order on the passivation behavior of aluminum oxides grown using ozone.","chemistry_names":   [

The Ta interlayered samples were prepared by depositing Ta and Ti films sequentially on Si(111) substrates in a UHV system. As control samples, 100Å Ti films were deposited directly on clean Si(111) substrates. The deposited substrates were annealed for 10 min, in-situ, at temperatures between 500°C and 750°C using 50°C increments. The TiSi2, which formed in this UHV process, was analyzed with XRD, AES, SEM, TEM, and four-point probe measurements. The control samples exhibited the C49 to C54 transition at a temperature of 750°C. However, the TiSi2 samples with 5Å and 10Å Ta interlayers displayed a significant reduction of the phase transition temperature. The XRD analysis indicated that the C49 to C54 transition temperature of TiSi2 was lowered by ∼200°C. The sheet resistance measurement showed a low resistivity characteristic of C54. The SEM and TEM micrographs showed that the Ta interlayer also suppressed the surface agglomeration of the C54 TiSi2 film. The AES analysis data indicated that the composition of the titanium silicide showed the expected Ti:Si stoichiometry of 1:2.","chemistry_names":   [

With this in mind, we used Conducting Atomic Force Microscopy, combined with physical analysis to understand the nature of these charges.

Recording local IV's in those \u2018weak\u2019 spots suggests that they consist of positive charge.

Photoluminescence excitation measurements showed that the peak position of the excitation bands were independent of temperature suggesting that the electronic fine structure in our system was not due to the Jahn-Teller effect. Selective excitation measurements revealed that no peak shift occurs with changing excitation wavelength, indicating that Cu+ pairs or aggregates and Cu+-defect coupled centers were not existent in our system. Finally, several models were proposed for off-center displacements of Cu in SrS, since a rigorous treatment of these displacements is difficult. Both the tetragonal and trigonal distortion models for a <111> displacement yielded reasonable distortions parameters of 0. 16Å and 0.11Å, respectively.

There is a systematic variation in the morphology of the ZnO nanostructures with variation of process parameters, such as microwave power, microwave irradiation time, type of solvents, surfactants/structure-directing agents and its type and concentration. The as-prepared powder sample may either need a very brief exposure to heat to remove the surfactant or no post-synthesis processing, and is found to be well-crystallised. Determination of their crystallinity, actual shape, and orientation was made using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"During the past several years, we have developed high displacement sensitivity tunneling accelerometers using surface micromachining and metal electroplating techniques. These devices consist of a Au tunneling tip fabricated below a 1-2 μm thick metal cantilever beam of electroplated Ni or Au. A thin film of e-beam evaporated Au on the underside of the cantilever serves as the tunneling counter electrode. In operation, a 100mV bias is applied across the tunneling gap. A larger turn-on voltage is also applied between the cantilever and a control electrode, located on the substrate, to deflect the cantilever and maintain a constant tunneling current of 1 or 10 nA. Typical deflections of the end of 100 μm-long and 250 μm-long cantilevers are 0.5μm during operation. We have observed that the turn-on voltage decreases over time for most devices with a larger drop observed for the Au cantilevers. In all cases, the initial decay of the turn-on voltage was almost completely recoverable after the device was turned off for 24 hrs. This decay was not found to be strongly dependent on the magnitude of the tunneling current, but could be significantly reduced by pre-stressing the cantilever before operation. Finally, a vacuum anneal at 100°C influences the measured temperature dependence of the turn-on voltage. The observed effects appear to be consistent with fatigue and creep phenomena in the cantilevers. These effects are reversible at room temperature and are dependent on the stress and temperature history of the devices. A comparison is made between metal plated and all-Si structures.","chemistry_names":   [

This is mainly due to the low resistance, extracellular cleft formed between the cell's plasma membrane and the substrate to which it adhere. This cleft shunts the current generated by the neuron, or the device and thus reduces the signal to noise ratio. To increase the clefts electrical resistance we fabricated gold micronails that protrude from the transistor gate surface. The micronails were functionalized by phagocytosis facilitating peptides.

The Seebeck coefficient is positive in whole measured temperature range (77K and 300K) and it decreases with Sr content. At room temperature S(T) changes from 400 μ/K for the samples with the lowest levels of Sr to 30 μV/K for the samples with the highest Sr levels. The behavior of S(T) fits to Heikes model, which describes the behavior of Seebeck coefficient in systems where the correlated hopping is present. With the Sr content, the electrical resistivity changes its behavior from semiconducting to metallic and it took values from 2.4 to 10−3 Ωcm. From S(T) and rho(T) measurements the thermoelectric power factor, PF was obtained. The maximum values for PF were about 5 μW/K2cm in the samples where x= 0.03, which are comparable to the typical values for conventional thermoelectric semiconductors. The structural and morphological properties of the samples were studied by x-ray diffraction analysis and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) respectively.

 {"abstract":"The XIA DXP-4C is a 4 channel, CAMAC based, x-ray spectrometer which digitally processes directly digitized preamplifier signals. The DXP-4C was designed for instrumenting multi-detector arrays for synchrotron radiation applications, and optimized for very high count rates at a low cost per detector channel. This produced a very compact and low power (3.4 W/channel) instrument for its count rate and MCA capabilities, which thus provides a strong basis for portable applications. Because all functions are digitally controlled, it can be readily adapted to various user interfaces, including remote access interfaces. Here we describe the design and examine approaches to lowering its power to 50 mW/channel. We then consider the issues in applying it to three typical portable or remote spectrometry applications.","chemistry_names":   [

The Seebeck coefficient of the solid solution gradually decreases with increasing temperature and the values are larger than those of CoP3 and CoAs3 in the temperature range investigated, with a maximum value of about 89 μV/K near room temperature. The thermal conductivity of CoP3 and CoAs3 are higher than that of CoSb3, as can be expected from the effect of anionic size on lattice vibration. A substantial reduction in thermal conductivity was observed for the solid solution compared to the constituent binary compounds due to additional phonon scattering from lattice disorder and other possible point defects such as vacancies.

The optical absorption of samples where the silver nanoparticles were embedded in thin amorphous silicon layer showed an enhancement peak around the plasmon resonance of 800 nm.

In this latter case, the interface is between two crystalline lattices. Stresses in epitaxial Al films and polycrystalline Cu films were determined by substrate- curvature measurements.

The severity of the deviations depends on both the half-included angle of the indenter and the Poisson ratio of the material being indented. The solution is found to underestimate the actual contact radii by up to 9% and 27% for rigid conical indenters with half-included angles of 70.32° and 42.28°, respectively. Approximate analytical corrections to the Sneddon relationships are presented for the case of a right circular cone of arbitrary included angle.

 {"abstract":"The formation of ultra-shallow junctions (USJs) for future integrated circuit technologies requires preamorphization and high dose boron doping to achieve high activation levels and abrupt profiles. To achieve the challenging targets set out in the semiconductor roadmap, it is crucial to reach a much better understanding of the basic physical processes taking place during USJ processing. In this paper we review current understanding of dopant-defect interactions during thermal processing of device structures \u2013 interactions which are at the heart of the dopant diffusion and activation anomalies seen in USJs. First, we recall the formation and thermal evolution of End of Range (EOR) defects upon annealing of preamorphized implants (PAI). It is shown that various types of extended defect can be formed: clusters, {113} defects and dislocation loops. During annealing, these defects exchange Si interstitial atoms and evolve following an Ostwald ripening mechanism. We review progress in developing models based on these concepts, which can accurately predict EOR defect evolution and interstitial transport between the defect layer and the surface. Based on this physically based defect modelling approach, combined with fully coupled multi-stream modelling of dopant diffusion, one can perform highly predictive simulations of boron diffusion and de/re-activation in Ge-PAI boron USJs. Agreement between simulations and experimental data is found over a wide range of experimental conditions, clearly indicating that the driving mechanism that degrades boron junction depth and activation is the dissolution of the interstitial defect band. Finally, we briefly outline some promising methods, such as co-implants and/or vacancy engineering, for further down-scaling of source-drain resistance and junction depth.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"The relationship between approximant structures and quasicrystals is discussed on the example of quantitatively known decagonal quasicrystal and approximant structures in the thoroughly studied system Al-Co-Ni. The binary Al-Co as well as the ternary Al-Co-Ni approximants consist of the same basic pentagonal bipyramidal structure elements as the decagonal phase. The binary Al-Ni approximants, on the other hand, are vacancy ordered superstructures of the AlNi §-phase, which itself is related to the periodic average structure of decagonal Al-Co-Ni. Thus, the decagonal phase may be considered as a compromise between the competing driving forces to form pentagonal structural units on the one side and vacancy ordered superstructures of the AlNi §-phase on the other side. The broad stability range of decagonal Al-Co-Ni can be interpreted in terms of entropy gain by Co/Ni substitutional disorder and phasonic disorder of a part of the Al atoms.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Obstructing commercialization of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) is the soaring cost of platinum and other catalysts used to increase membrane efficiency. The goal of this investigation is to find a relatively inexpensive catalyst for coating the membrane and enhancing the efficiency of the PEMFC. Graphene oxide was reduced using NaBH4 in the presence of metal salts, primarily KAuCl4 and K2PtCl4, to synthesize metal-nanoparticle/reduced graphene oxide (RGO). FTIR indicated the successful synthesis of RGO, while Transmission Electron Microscopy displayed the presence of nanoparticles on RGO sheets. Nafion® membranes were coated with metal-nanoparticle/RGO and tested in an experimental PEMFC alongside bare Nafion®, Gold (Au) nanoparticles, and RGO. The metal-nanoparticle/RGO composites enhanced the PEMFC compared to bare Nafion®. Au-RGO, the best catalyst composite, increased the efficiency up to 150% better than nanoparticles or RGO alone while using only 1% of the concentration of Au nanoparticles. Theoretical power output of the Au-RGO synergy could increase fuel cell efficiency up to 18 times more than the Au-nanoparticles themselves by altering concentrations of Au nanoparticles in Au-RGO. The Au nanoparticles changed the structure and catalytic ability of graphene in the Au-RGO, offering a promising future for PEM fuel cell technology.","chemistry_names":   [

SURE students learn about industrial research by visiting IBM and getting a tour of the Almaden Research Center. A Career Day is held during the Program where students are given workshops on applying to graduate school as well as talks from people in different scientific careers, both traditional and nontraditional.

Although BD is SiO2 based, it is vastly different from oxide in terms of dielectric strength and reliability. One of the main reliability concerns is the drift of copper ions under electric field to the surrounding dielectric layer and this is evaluated by voltage ramp (V-ramp) and time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB). Metal 1 and Metal 2 intralevel comb structures with different metal widths and spaces were chosen for dielectric breakdown studies. Breakdown field of individual test structures were obtained from V-ramp tests in the temperature range of 30 to 150°C. TDDB was performed in the field range 0.5 \u2013 2 MV/cm. From the leakage between combs at the same level (either metal 1 or metal 2) Cu drift through SiC/BD or SiN/BD interface was characterized.

Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy revealed that during capacitor fabrication, the FIB rendered around 20nm of dielectric at the electrode-dielectric interface amorphous, associated with local gallium impregnation. Such a region would act electrically in series with the single crystal and would presumably have a considerable negative influence on dielectric properties. However, annealing prior to electrode deposition was found to fully recover the single crystal, and homogenise the gallium profile. Some subsequent dielectric testing of SrTiO3 was performed yielding a room temperature dielectric constant of ∼150 and loss tangent of 0.015 at 100kHz. A technique has therefore been demonstrated which allows fabrication of capacitors in which size-effects in \u2018thin-films\u2019 can be studied, without the influence of grain boundaries, and other issues associated with conventional thin film growth.","chemistry_names":   [

LTA process effectiveness in terms of crystal damage recovery as well as dopant diffusion and activation is studied through room-temperature photoluminescence, Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy and four-point probe sheet resistance. These studies demonstrate that non-melt LTA with multiple pulses induces high activation without visible diffusion with an effective curing of the implantation-induced crystalline defects.

This study focuses on the thermal stability of selective emitters for solar thermophotovoltaic (STPV) systems to enhance the conversion efficiency. 2-D photonic crystals are periodic micro/nano-scale structures that are designed to affect the motion of photons at certain wavelengths. The structured patterns, however, lose their structural integrity at high temperature, which disrupts the tight tolerances required for spectral control of the thermal emitters. Through analytical studies and experimental observations, the four major mechanisms of thermal degradation of 2-D photonic crystal are identified: oxidation, grain growth and re-crystallization, surface diffusion, and evaporation and re-condensation. In this work, the design of a flat surface photonic crystal (FSPC) is proposed and experimental validations are performed.","chemistry_names":   [

The CH complexes in AlGaN, formed either during growth or by proton irradiation, exhibit five local vibrational modes (LVMs) due to the symmetric and asymmetric vibrational stretching modes of C-H in CHn (n=1\u2013;3) defect complexes. It was found that the annealing temperature (Ta) of 500°C is sufficient enough to dissociate most of the C-H complexes in AlGaN samples. A turning point annealing temperature is found around 300°C for un-irradiated Mg-doped sample, below which the total integrated area of the C-H LVMs continued to increase with increasing annealing temperature and reach the maximum value around 300°C. At Ta > 300°C, the total integrated area of the C-H LVMs starts to decrease and the C-H complexes seem to be completely depleted at Ta > 600°C. The depleted C-H LVMs were observed to partially recover after thermal annealing at Ta > 500°C and waiting for aging periods of several days. This recovery behavior is explained in terms of the hydrogen being remained inside the crystal after the dissociation of C-H complexes, subsequent diffusion and recombining again with carbon atom to reform C-H complexes.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"The incorporation of hydrogen into standard p-type Czochralski (Cz) silicon (≥1 Ωcm) by a 110 MHz plasma treatment at 260°C leads to the formation of an n-type region due to hydrogen enhanced thermal donor (TD) formation in hydrogenated regions of the wafer, if a subsequent annealing in air is applied at 450°C. Spreading resistance probe (SRP) and light beam induced current (LBIC) measurements were used for the experimental analysis. The p-n junction depth, i. e. the counter doping by TDs, depends on the initial doping level of the p-type substrate, and therefore on the post-hydrogenation annealing time. The penetration of the n-type region into the wafer bulk is driven by a rapid hydrogen diffusion. The essential process for a TD generation is the creation of metastable hydrogen molecular species around 260°C and their decay at 450°C.","chemistry_names":   [

FTIR measurements in structurally well-characterized samples exhibiting all X-ray reflections of crystalline hexagonal ZnO show absorbance bands around 405 cm-1(Zn-O stretching vibration) and 1110 cm-1 (in-plane C-H vibrations on aromatic rings of polyimide). Observed shifts in both absorption features as a function of deposition temperatures can probably be attributed to thermal stress in the layers. PL measurements showed broad spectra centered around 3.35 eV from ZnO excitonic emission and a broader PL band from 2.7 to 3.1 eV defect complex emissions. The appearance of these peaks was consistent for depositions of ZnO on non-organic substrates, which indicates that the integration of ZnO thin films on polymer based substrate preserved the characteristic optical properties of ZnO.","chemistry_names":   [

By plasma-polymerization (PP) process using ring-type siloxane precursor, a new self-organized porous SiOCH film is developed with preserving the original hexagonal silica-backbone structure, thus so called as a molecular-pore-stack (MPS) SiOCH film. The hydrocarbon-rich MPS film has high endurance to the process damages. A density-modulated MPS film is obtained with reinforced interfaces by plasma co-polymerization (PcP) process using not only the ring-type but also linear-type siloxane. Furthermore, an ultimate full low-k module with low-k silica-amorphous-carbon composite (SACC) cap, instead of high-k SiCN, is also obtained simply by the one-step deposition scheme. The modulated PcP process and the sophisticated molecular design of the precursor siloxane provides scaled-down interconnect modules with good mechanical strength and excellent dielectric reliability at a low manufacturing cost, applicable for 45/32/22nm-nodes ULSIs.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"As a consequence of the unusual nature of plutonium's electronic structure, point- and extended-defects are expected to, and do exhibit extraordinary properties. Low temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements on Pu and fcc-Pu(Ga) show that the magnetic susceptibility increases as a function of time, yet upon annealing the specimen returns to its initial magnetic susceptibility. This excess magnetic susceptibility (EMS) arises from the alpha-decay and U recoil damage cascades which produce vacancy and interstitials as point and extended defects. The temperature of the first annealing stage defines a temperature (<35K) below which we are able to characterize the time and temperature evolution of the accumulating damage cascades as being a saturation function. The temperature dependence of the EMS is well described by a time independent, Curie-Weiss curve arising from a volumetric region surrounding each U damage cascade. This saturation picture also leads directly to a determination of the microscopic volume of the specimen that is affected by the frozen-in damage cascade. For our measurements in δ-Pu we calculate a diameter of the magnetically affected volume of ∼250Å per damage cascade. This should be compared with an estimated volume that encloses the damage cascade itself (determined from molecular dynamics) of ∼100 Å. Hence, the ratio of these volumes is ∼8. The observed anomalous magnetic behavior is likely a consequence of the highly correlated nature of the electrons. Similarities with defects in hole-doped superconductors suggest a general phenomenon in strongly correlated electron systems, of which Pu may be a particularly unusual or special example.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Tungsten and molybdenum hexacarbonyls were used as precursors in chemical vapour deposition process for preparation of W and Mo thin films. Pyrolitical decomposition of these precursors proceeds at temperatures of 250\u2013400°C. Thin films with thicknesses in the range of 0,02\u20131 μm were deposited on different substrates - bare or covered with CdTe glass, and monocrystalline Si. Microstructural studies performed by Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) method showed that films deposited tend to grow textured. This is discussed as probably due to differences in the growth rate for various crystal planes. The sheet resistances of the as-deposited W and Mo films are in the range of 20\u201330 Ω/□ for thicknesses of 0.15 μm. After thermal annealing the resistance of W films drops to about 2 Ω/□ and for Mo films to about 9Ω/□. Decreasing in the resistivity of the films is tightly connected with the decreasing in the impurities concentration. These impurities are considered to be in the base of the observed behaviour of the temperature dependence of the electrical resistance of the films. The CVD-W and Mo films are studied as back contacts on CdTe layer in CdS/CdTe photocells. In the paper some preliminary results are presented for the sheet and contact resistances when CVD W and Mo films are deposited at lower temperatures on the surface of CdTe layers, deposited by closespaced sublimation method. The thin film materials, produced by CVD technology look promising with respect to the required high deposition rates and extremely wide deposition areas in the mass production of solar cells.","chemistry_names":   [

We compare our predicted materials design to fabricate a low resistivity p-type ZnO with the recent successful codoping. Based upon the success in the valence control of ZnO, we propose a materials design to fabricate the ferromagnetic Mn-doped p-type ZnO upon codoping. It is shown that the anti-ferromagnetic state is more stable than the ferromagnetic ones due to the anti-ferromagnetic super-exchange interaction, if we have no mobile holes. Upon codoping with the mobile holes, it is shown that the ferromagnetic state becomes more stable than the anti-ferromagnetic ones due to the ferromagnetic double-exchange interaction. However, it is shown that the anti-ferromagnetic state is more stable upon electron doping due to the anti-ferromagnetic super-exchange interaction. We calculate the chemical trends of the magnetic state in V-, Cr-, Fe-, Co-, and Ni-doped (25 at%) in ZnO, and predict that all of these materials show the ferromagnetic ground states without electron and hole doping.","chemistry_names":   [

The second harmonic generation (SHG) of dendrons was measured in the molecular oriented thin films prepared by the Langmuir-Blodgett film transfer technique. In such structurally organized thin films, individual chromophores coherently contribute to the increase in the molecular hyperpolarizability of dendrons. The SHG activity became large as the numbers of branching units of dendrons increased. The highest molecular hyperpolarizability was found to be <8000×10−30 esu for dendron containing 15 chromophoric units.

 {"abstract":"Controlling material properties over nanometer length scales is crucial for current and emerging high-density microelectronic device packages. Miniaturization of devices is increasingly limited by the ability to \u201cconnect\u201d to the device, and the required packaging structures must be fabricated where layer thickness and feature sizes approach micron size scales while achieving the required mechanical, thermal and electrical properties. Second phase additions such as sub-micron sized particles are often added to locally adjust the material properties of constituent layers in the complex package structure. This results in significant variation of mechanical properties over sub-micron length scales. Such manipulation of material structure and its effects on mechanical and interfacial fracture behavior are addressed using experimental and modeling studies. Underfill layers consisting of an epoxy matrix with dispersed silica beads are shown to exhibit variations of elastic and flow properties in excess of three-fold across the layer thickness. Mechanical properties are not only affected by the distribution of second-phase fillers, but also by the adhesion properties of the filler/matrix interface. Interfaces are susceptible to stress corrosion cracking associated with moisture which can lead to progressive debond growth at loads much lower than that required to exceed the critical interface fracture energies.

 {"abstract":"The dielectric properties of the heat-resistant heterocyclic polymers are governed by their chemical structure and the absence of unwanted dipoles. A polyphenylquinoxaline is taken as an example of the effect of the dipole symmetry. In the particular case of polyimides, it is obvious that the dehydrocyclization of the intermediate polyamic acid has to be completed to produce the lowest achievable permittivity. This is illustrated by the polycondensation in solution of the polyimides based on 4,4'-(9H-fluoren-9-ylidene)-bisbenzeneamine. In addition, the spatial conformation of the macromolecular chain can also play an important role. The chemistry of a polyimide prepared from 4,4'-(1,3-benzenedicarbonyl) bis(1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid dianhydride) allows to discuss this topic. However, a dielectric constant of 2.7 seems to be the ultimate value achievable for dense films prepared with the most performing polymers. The introduction of homogeneously distributed micro-voids allows the preparation of dielectric films with a permittivity lower than 2.0. The modification of a polymer with tertiobutyl carbonate (t.BOC) groups is a promising approach because it offers a large processability window.","chemistry_names":   [

A contrasted behaviour appears between low temperature processed films which retain the templating agent and are thus little compressible, and high temperature processed films, which are more condensed and also exhibit high porosity. We suggest that the behaviour of the former is dominated by shear flow, at least above a given threshold, while the latter are characterized by a yield strength in compression as is commonly found in porous materials. The response to indentation allows fast qualitative comparison of mechanical responses: in the present work, we show that a fast UV-O3 treatment results in mechanical properties which are undistinguishable from a much more cumbersome high temperature heat treatment.","chemistry_names":   [

Variations in measured grain boundary concentration, both within a sample and between samples, are reduced by refinements in both the radiation and the AES techniques. These refinements include improvements in temperature control, uniformity of sample-to-sample dose, grain boundary acceptance criteria, amount of intergranular fracture, and amount of beam current used in analysis. AES measurements on samples irradiated at 400°C to 1.0 dpa show how implementing the technique refinements reduces the variability in the measured concentrations. Additionally, measurements from regions of ductile tearing in samples irradiated to 0.1 and 1.0 dpa at 400°C, to 1.0 dpa at 200°C, and from unirradiated samples show that sensitivity factors must be determined to obtain the most accurate measurement of grain boundary composition.","chemistry_names":   [

The parameters of this model are based on MD simulations, or on first principles calculations. In a second part, we have investigated the subsequent evolution of the primary damage with a model based on a vacancy jump mechanism. These simulations which rely on an adapted EAM potential show the formation of copper rich defects. Some of the potential's predictions that played a key role in the model were checked by ab initio calculations.

 {"abstract":"Nanomechanical properties of mineralized tissues are determined by microstructural tissue organization and relative composition of organic, mineral, and water phases. We combine nanoindentation and quantitative backscattered electron (qBSE) imaging to understand how these factors influence material properties at the ultrastructural and tissue level. Developmental stages of equine tooth enamel provide a good situation for studying the effects of enamel prism orientation and mineralization. Equine cheek teeth continue to form new enamel whilst mature tissue is being worn away. Hence we can study graded mineral content that increases with enamel maturity. Hunter-Schreger bands (HSBs) containing enamel prisms of contrasting orientations allow investigation of the effect of orientation on modulus. An equine second mandibular molar (2-year-old) was embedded in poly-methylmethacrylate, sectioned longitudinally, polished, carbon coated, imaged in qBSE, and subjected to nanoindentation testing. Elastic modulus increases significantly during maturation as enamel protein matrix degradation makes space for increased mineral content with closer proximity of enamel crystals, finally reaching values exceeding 80 GPa for little further increase in mineral content. Indentations spanning HSBs in immature, poorly mineralized enamel yielded modulus values that varied with prism orientation in a sinusoidal pattern where modulus varies by as much as a factor of three. Nanoindentation helps to elucidate how the composition and ultrastructural organization of enamel contribute to mechanical properties.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"High-resolution x-ray triple axis diffractometry was used to characterize damage recovery in gallium arsenide implanted with gallium or indium ions, and co-implanted with carbon ions. From reciprocal space mapping around the (004) reciprocal lattice point, the evolution of residual strain and the lattice plane tilt induced by the ion implantation and annealing processes were analyzed. The lattice damage in implanted gallium arsenide is dependent on the dose and ion type; annealing subsequently alters the structural properties of the material. For example, In/C co-implanted gallium arsenide shows a greater amount of residual damage as compared to Ga/C co-implanted gallium arsenide after rapid thermal annealing at 885 °C for 5 seconds. For a given Group III ion / C co-implant, we observe the highest p-type activation when the Group III ion and C implant doses are the same. Increasing the Group III ion dose reduces the material quality and has a concomitant negative effect on the electrical properties of the material. These results suggest that reciprocal space maps can provide insight into the relationship between the structure and properties of implanted compound semiconductors.","chemistry_names":   [

Lead zirconacte titanate (PZT) films between 1 and 3 μm thick with a ratio of Zr to Ti of 40:60 were deposited onto 3 mm square silicon membranes. The total tensile stress in the composite structure reaches 100 MPa during standard fabrication processing. Utilizing analytical calculations, a structure was determined that lowered the residual stress of the composite to 11 MPa and increased the electromechanical coupling 35 times. Changing the geometry of the electrode coverage decreased the residual stress of the composite by 40%. Trenching around the membrane provided a membrane with boundary conditions that approached simply supported and decreased the composite residual stress by another 16%.

For the thermal spike, the ion beam mixing parameter Dt/Φ is derived as being proportional to χ2+μ, where the damage parameter is defined as, χ = − F0/ΔHcoh, F0 is the damage energy deposited per unit path length, and μ is a constant dependent on the thermal spike shape and point defect density in the thermal spike regions. The shape of the thermal spike that best fit the experimental results depends on the magnitude of the cascade density. For relatively high density collisional cascades, where thermal spikes start to be important, it was found that a spherical thermal spike model was more consistent with experimental measurements at low temperatures.

This model was coupled with fundamental descriptions of the flow, heat and mass transfer in MOVPE reactors. All the uncertainties of the model were lumped into the two rate constants of the surface growth reaction. Finite element simulations of GaAs growth in a rotating-disk MOVPE reactor reported in the literature were used to fit the two unknown rate constants. Without any adjustment, the model could predict observed growth rates at higher susceptor rotational rates. A more serious robustness test was the fully coupled 2-D simulation of GaAs growth in a horizontal MOVPE reactor by using a state-of-the-art code (MPSalsa) developed at Sandia National Laboratories. The model predicted observed growth rates reasonably well in 2-D fully coupled simulations of flow, heat and mass transfer. Further development of the kinetic model by testing different kinetic scenaria in 2- and 3-d simulations and by using data obtained at kinetically-limited growth conditions is planned in order to develop a reactor-independent simulator of the MOVPE of GaAs.

The binding distribution for platelet containing samples, determined using H evolution, exhibits two peaks: a bulk peak at 1.8\u20131.9 eV below the transport barrier, and a second possibly surface related peak 1.8\u20131.9 eV below the surface evolution barrier. The bulk peak grows at 250C and is consistent with calculated energies for platelet structures. The same two evolution peaks are found in hydrogenated polycrystalline Si and amorphous silicon. The IR spectra for heavily hydrogenated c-Si are dominated by the stretching modes at 2076 and 2128 cm-1. Most surprisingly there appears to be a strong mode at 856 cm-1 which is associated with a deformation mode of SiH3.

 {"abstract":"Co-Cr thin film with the excellent c-axis orientation is required as the media for ultra high density perpendicular recording. There are two dominant factors that affect the c-axis orientation. One is the process condition such as argon gas pressure and targets-substrate distance L which change the kinetic energies of arriving atoms on substrate. The concept of mean collision number was introduced to get better understanding the relation between c-axis orientation and kinetic energy of particles. In this study, Facing Targets Sputtering (FTS) system was used because of its superiority as the plasma free sputtering. And the other is the interfacial effect between the substrate and the deposited film. In order to investigate the Interfacial effect, it has been performed to prepare the CoCr(500Å)/CoCr(500Å) double layer. By controlling the argon gas pressure, thin layers with different c-axis orientation can be easily obtained. When the c-axis well oriented 1st layer was used as the under layer, good c-axis orientation of 2nd layer was obtained even at the high argon gas pressure at which c-axis orientation in the single layer is poor. However, this improvement of c-axis orientation did not continue with the increase of the thickness of 2nd layer. It was clarified that there was the critical thickness in the 2nd layer affected by the c-axis orientation of under layer. As a result, it was concluded that the process condition was the superior dominant factor for c-axis orientation.","chemistry_names":   [

For undoped STO film, the influences of the forming processes on their resistive switching properties were studied by current and voltage controlled I-V sweeps, respectively. An obvious current controlled negative differential conductance phenomenon was found in both polarities of the electrical field. However, for low Indium doped STIO (x=0.1), the filament related resistance switching was observed in both the current and voltage I-V sweeps. And for high Indium doped STIO (x=0.2), a resistance switching with a reverse direction change to that in undoped STO can be obtained by a proper forming process. Based on these results, the reversible change of the Schottky like barrier at the grain boundary by the migration of oxygen vacancies were proposed to interpret the mechanism of the resistance switching.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"We have developed an ab-initio method for calculating the static response functions in substitutional alloys. For magnetic alloys, in addition to the nuclear diffuse scattering, a contribution to the alloy diffuse scattering intensities results from the response of the local moments to changes in the \u2018local\u2019 chemical environment (i.e. ∂μi/∂cj). We present results of firstprinciples calculations of these \u2018local\u2019 response functions in magnetic alloys. These response functions, which may be directly compared to neutron-scattering and Mößbauer experiments, are derived via a mean-field statistical mechanical description of compositional fluctuations in alloys. The statistical averages are performed via the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker coherent potential approximation, which incorporates the electronic structure of the high-temperature, chemically disordered state. As a first application of the theory, we have investigated the environmental dependence of the moments in NiFe alloys and FeV alloys and multilayers. We compare our results with experiments on bulk alloys and multilayers. Also, a comparison is made to a set of first-principle \u2018supercell\u2019 calculations.

Site-directed assembly using this pIII peptide fusion was studied using a variety of precursor concentrations, incubation times, and phage concentrations. For comparision, free ZnO-binding peptides were also used to biomineralize ZnO. Isolated, polydisperse, spherical ZnO nanoparticles were formed at all mineralization conditions containing the ZnO-binding M13 bacteriophage, whereas free peptide mineralization resulted in smaller, more irregularly shaped particles which agglomerated at longer incubation times.

TiO2-xNx photocatalysts have been formed in seconds at room temperature at the nanoscale via the direct nitration of anatase TiO2 nanocolloids. Tunability throughout the visible depends upon the degree of agglomeration and the ability to seed these nanoparticles with metal ions. Co metal ion seeding leads to the efficient room temperature phase transformation, of anatase to rutile TiO2, where normally much higher temperatures are required. Seeding of a properly nitridated TiO2 nanocolloid with transition metal ions (Co, Ni) allows for the enhancement of the infrared spectra of the TiO2-xNx nitridated titania surface in excess of 10-fold, providing a means to analyze for minor contaminants and intermediates. Evidence for nitrogen fixation is found in Fe treated systems. The TiO2-xNx systems act as visible light absorbing photocatalyts. These photocatalysts and additional nanostructured metal oxides can be placed on the surface of PS-based sensor and microreactor configurations to greatly improve the interface response.","chemistry_names":   [

Reductions in stress variation between window and overgrown regions can be achieved by using a double ELO GaN growth at a much smaller ELO thickness. Increased compressive stress at the coalescence boundary of two adjacent wings of ELO GaN was related to the presence of voids in this area.

The anodizing conditions can be adjusted to start forming alumina wires that originate on the surface of the porous alumina layer at the triple junction points (the edges of the hexagonal inter-pore structure where three pores meet). The wires tangle together as they become longer; eventually creating a tangled mesh layer above the porous oxide layer. SEM micrographs of the oxide cross section show tapered wires that are approximately 2 to 10 m long, depending on anodizing time, and range in width from a few nanometers to 50nm. The aluminum substrate can be chemically removed and the alumina barrier layer dissolved to leave a free standing porous alumina membrane with very high surface area alumina wires on one face.

These changes are directly driven by irradiation induced changes to the crystal structure as reflected through the bulk microstructure. Therefore it is important that irradiation changes and there implications on component property changes are understood.

 {"abstract":"The ultrasonic pulse transmission method (100-500 kHz) was adapted to measure compressional (P) and shear (S) wave velocities for synthetic soils fabricated from quartz-clay and quartz-peat mixtures. Velocities were determined as samples were loaded by small (up to 0.1 MPa) uniaxial stress to determine how stress at grain contacts affects wave amplitudes, velocities, and frequency content. Samples were fabricated from quartz sand mixed with either a swelling clay or peat (natural cellulose). P velocities in these dry synthetic soil samples were low, ranging from about 230 to 430 m/s for pure sand, about 91 to 420 m/s for sand-peat mixtures, and about 230 to 470 m/s for dry sand-clay mixtures. S velocities were about half of the P velocity in most cases, about 130 to 250 m/s for pure sand, about 75-220 m/s for sand-peat mixtures, and about 88-220 m/s for dry sand-clay mixtures. These experiments demonstrate that P and S velocities are sensitive to the amount and type of admixed second phase at low concentrations. We found that dramatic increases in all velocities occur with small uniaxial loads, indicating strong nonlinearity of the acoustic properties. Composition and grain packing contribute to the mechanical response at grain contacts and the nonlinear response at low stresses.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"A total area conversion efficiency of 10.2% has been achieved for a 1Ocm×1Ocm integrated-type single-junction amorphous silicon (a-Si) solar cell submodule. It is the highest conversion efficiency ever reported for an a-Si solar cell with an area of 100cm2, including multi-junction cells. The effective area conversion efficiency is as high as 11.3%. The high efficiency is obtained by improving the quality of the i-layer and the p/i buffer layer, as well as by utilizing a highly textured, high-quality transparent electrode. The quality of the i-layer plays a dominant role in the performance of a-Si solar cells, especially in high efficiency cells. Techniques that control the properties of the high-quality a-Si films for the i-layer are described. Electric conductivity, ESR spin density and the Raman spectra of high-quality a-Si:H films are investigated as well as their thickness-dependence and substrate-dependence.","chemistry_names":   [

A method for extracting the carbon doping levels from lattice contraction measurements is suggested. The dependence of layer composition, free carrier concentration and hydrogen passivation on growth parameters are investigated.

 {"abstract":"In this paper, we measured and analyzed the operation lifetime of a high efficiency blue OLED which consists of N,N' \u2013Vdiphenyl -N,N'-bis(1-napthyl) -1,1'-biphenyl-4,4'- diamine (NPB) as the hole-transport layer (HTL), 4,4'-bis[2-(4-(N,N-diphenylamino)phenyl)vinyl]biphenyl (DPAVBi) doped in 9,10-bis(2';-naphthyl) anthracene (ADN) as the emitting layer (EML), and bis(10-hydroxyben-zo[h]quinolinato)beryllium (Bebq2) as the electron-transport layer (ETL). Due to the high electron mobility of the ETL (one order of magnitude higher than Alq3), the carrier balance is achieved and a blue OLED with a high external quantum efficiency of 8.32% is obtained. The device structure of our blue OLED device is ITO /HTL (40nm)/EML (45nm, 4% dopant)/ETL (15nm)/ LiF(1.2nm)/Al (100nm). In our operation lifetime measurement, we fixed the initial luminescence of the blue OLEDs at 12500, 10000, 7000, 5000 cd/m2 with a constant current driving. The resulting half-lifetime are 5.58, 16.56, 27, 109.819 hours, respectively. To estimate the half-lifetime of this device, we use a well-known relation in our fitting: L*t1/2n= constant where n is the acceleration coefficient, and t1/2 is the half-lifetime. In our blue OLED, the n value is 3.088. By using the equation, we can calculate that the estimated half lifetime at an initial luminance of 1000 cd/m2 achieves 15611 hours in our device. For further investigating the lifetime mechanism in our blue OLED, we fit all the luminance versus time curves obtained under different driving condition. We found that luminance is inversely proportional to the square of the time, rather than a typically stretched exponential decay which means the luminance decay is a second-order reaction in our blue OLED.","chemistry_names":   [

In this paper some of the generic-materials characteristics, generally believed to be required for a high figure of merit, will be discussed in terms of the experimental approach to their evaluation and optimization.

 {"abstract":"For silicon nitride (SiNx) deposited at 3 nm/s using hot wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD), the mass-density reached an ultra high value of 3.0 g/cm3. Etch rates in a 16BHF solution show that the lowest etch rate occurs for films with a N/Si ratio of 1.2, the ratio where also the maximum in mass density occurs. The thus found etch rate of 7 nm/min is much better than that for PECVD layers, even when made at a much lower deposition rate. The root-mean-square (rms) roughness measured on 300 nm thick SiN1.2 layers is only about 1 nm, which is advantageous for obtaining high field-effect mobility in thin-film transistors. SiN1.2 films have succesfully been tested in \u201call hot wire\u201d thin film transistors (TFTs). SiNx films with various x values in the range 1.0 < × <1.5 have been incorporated in metal-insulator-semiconductor structures with n-type c-Si wafers to determine their electrical properties from C-V and I-V measurements. We analyzed the behavior of the static dielectric constant, fixed nitride charges and trapped nitride charges as function of N/Si ratio. I-V measurements show that the HW SiNx films with N/Si ≥ 1.33 have high dielectric breakdown fields that exceed 5.9 MV/cm. For these films we deduce a low positive fixed nitride charge density of 6.2-7.8 × 1016 cm-3 from the flat band voltage and from the small hysteresis in the backward sweep we deduce a low fast trapped charge density of 1.3-1.7 × 1011 cm-2. The dielectric constant ε for different compositions is seen not to change appreciably over the whole range and amounts to 6.3 ± 0.1. These high-density SiNx films possess very low tensile stress (down to 16 MPa), which will be helpful in for instance, plastic electronics applications. HWCVD provides high quality a-SiNx materials with good dielectric properties at a high deposition rate.","chemistry_names":   [

A compact reflection-type phase shifter fabricated on sapphire substrates coated with ferroelectric barium strontium titanate (BST) thin-films has been built which shows the promise of using BST thin films in the design of tunable microwave devices. The phase shifter, fabricated as one monolithic assembly, consists of a 3dB coupler, meandered line inductors and tunable interdigital capacitors. A continuously variable phase shift range of more than 100° using the branch-line coupler was obtained at a center frequency of 2.95 GHz, and more than 90° phase shift over 200 MHz bandwidth with a bias voltage range from 0 V to 175 V. The phase shifter using the Lange coupler has over 700 MHz bandwidth centered at 2.2 GHz with a phase shift of more than 90° and an insertion loss less than 2 dB and return loss of greater than 14 dB, over a bias voltage range from 0 V to 160 V.

 {"abstract":"The alkali-borosilicate (ABS) system provides the basis for a wide variety of commercially important products among which are the nuclear waste glasses. Although a large number of investigations have been undertaken in the last five years, the corrosion mechanisms of the ABS glasses have not been characterized nearly as well as for the soda-lime-silicate (NCS) glasses commonly used for containers. It is well known that the corrosion of the latter glasses involves ion exchange, network dissolution, and precipitation mechanisms resulting in the development of one of five types of surface films. In the present paper we compare the corrosion behavior to the ABS and NCS glasses and discuss our current understanding of ABS glass corrosion in terms of mechanisms, kinetics, surface film formation and thermodynamics.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"In this paper the various performance advantages of SOI and SOS structures for submicron ULSI circuits will be described. In addition to the traditional speed and radiation-hardness advantages, there are several significant advantages of thin-film SOI compared to bulk structures for the submicron scaling of MOS transistors. These advantages include short-channel threshold voltage stability, improved sub-threshold slope, increased saturation current, and reduced hot electron effects. Both theory and data from several groups will be presented to illustrate these effects. Since these advantages all fall in areas that are critical limits to device engineering and scaling in the submicron regime, the motivation for using SOI should be even stronger as devices are scaled to smaller dimensions in the future. Consideration of SOI or SOS on the ULSI scale will require a technology capable of low defect films with a film thickness of 1000 A or less, however.\nThe prospects for minority carrier devices such as bipolar transistors for BI-MOS will also be discussed. Both device structure (lateral vs. vertical) and material quality are issues that must be addressed.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Monochromatized synchrotron radiation has been employed as the excitation source for soft x-ray emission spectroscopy. In the present paper changes in the emission spectra that occur as the excitation energy is varied near the core-absorption threshold are discussed. In the case of crystalline silicon, strong variations are seen in the L2,3 emission for excitation energies up to 30 eV above threshold. These variations are shown to be dependent on the crystalline order of the material and can be interpreted in terms of restrictions on the crystal momentum that arise in an inelastic scattering description of the combined absorption and emission. On the other hand this description is less relevant to the excitation-energy dependence of ionic insulators, in which strong phonon coupling removes these restrictions on crystal momentum. In the insulators B2O3 and BN strong variations in the emission are observed at threshold, upon creation of a core exciton: the exciton affects the emission through its influence on the phonon coupling as well as on the initial and final-state screening.","chemistry_names":   [

The RBS spectra from Au indicated that the interdiffused samples consisted of two layers: an Au-Nb binary layer on the surface and a ternary Au-Ni-Nb compound layer beneath the binary layer. The growth kinetics of the ternary compound layer differed in samples which had been relaxed prior to Au deposition from the kinetics for unrelaxed samples. Furthermore, cross section TEM micrographs showed that relaxed and unrelaxed samples exhibit different microstructures after the early stages, of annealing.

After learning of the work of Krätschmer et al. indicating the presence of C60 in carbon soot, we showed that samples consisting almost exclusively of C60 and C70 can be sublimed from such soot. Vibrational Raman spectra of C60 and C70 were obtained from these samples. The C60 spectrum Is consistent with the calculated spectrum of Buckmlnsterfullerene, and the strongest three lines can be assigned on the basis of frequency and polarization. The NMR spectrum of dissolved C60 was then obtained, and found to consist of a single resonance, establishing the icosahedral symmetry of this molecule. STM images of the C60 molecules on a Au(111) crystal face show that these clusters form hexagonal arrays with an intercluster spacing of 11.0 Å and are mobile at ambient temperature. Distinctly taller species evident in the arrays are believed to be C70 clusters. Vibrational Raman and infrared spectra have also been obtained for separated C60 and C70.","chemistry_names":   [

The calculations are performed using an ensemble Monte Carlo simulator including the full details of the conduction and valence bands along with a numerically determined, wave-vector dependent interband ionization transition rate determined from an empirical pseudopotential calculation. The first four conduction bands and first three valence bands, which fully comprise the energy range of interest for device simulation, are included in the analysis. It is found that the electron and hole ionization rates are comparable over the full range of applied electric field strengths examined. Based on these calculations an avalanche photodiode, APD, made from bulk zinc blende GaN then would exhibit poor noise and bandwidth performance. It should be noted however, that the accuracy of the band structure employed and the scattering rates is presently unknown since little experimental information is available for comparison. Therefore, due to these uncertainties, it is difficult to unequivocally conclude that the ionization rates are comparable.","chemistry_names":   [

For the detection of gases such as hydrogen, the semiconductors are typically coated with a catalyst metal such as Pd or Pt to increase the detection sensitivity at room temperature. Functionalizing the surface with oxides, polymers and nitrides is also useful in enhancing the detection sensitivity for gases and ionic solutions. The wide energy bandgap of these materials make them ideal for solar-blind UV detection, which can be of use for detecting fluorescence from biotoxins. The use of enzymes or adsorbed antibody layers on the semiconductor surface leads to highly specific detection of a broad range of antigens of interest in the medical and homeland security fields.

However, the effects of Bi segregation in inducing embrittlement seem greater than can currently be rationalized by such a concept and, also, there is evidence that fracture surfaces may not always coincide, microscopically, with the interface.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"a-Si:H/a-Si1−x Cx:H double-barrier structure imbedded in the i layer were fabricated by glow discharge. By using the built-in field in the i layer and the external applied bias, the effects of photo-excited carriers driven by electric field in the i layer tunneling through the double-barrier quantum well were examined. Distinct current bumps are distinctly observed when the quantum well structure is imbedded in the middle section of the i layer. A simple theoretical analysis was developed to study the quantum transport behavior.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"P doping of gallium nitride by incorporation of magnesium in the layers was controlled recently. Only Popovici et al. [1] have published the results of a Raman study on p type GaN. In the present communication, we report on the interaction of the free hole gas with the axial A1(LO) or planar E1(LO) phonon modes, evidenced by Raman scattering: the observed coupled phononplasmon mode is found very different from the corresponding one evidenced in silicon doped (n type) GaN. We compare the experimental data with the lineshape calculated within a dielectric model, using the results of electrical measurements. These results are also compared with infrared reflectivity spectra.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"We report on the electrical properties of defects introduced in epitaxial 4H-SiC by 2 MeV protons using deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). After proton irradiation with a dose of about 1.5×1014 cm-2, the DLTS measurements were made, and the rate window shows a single broad peak between 280 and 310 K. The intensity of this peak remains unchanged after a thermal anneal at 900°C for 20 min. However, after annealing at or above 1100°C, the peak intensity gradually decreases with anneal temperature up to 1500°C, indicating a decrease in the defect concentration. Because a complete damage recovery of the SiC is not observed even after annealing at 1500°C, we believe a higher temperature annealing is necessary for a complete recovery. Using a curve fit analysis, a set of deep levels of defect centers were found with energy ranging between 567 and 732 meV. These traps do not exhibit a significant change in the trap energy or capture cross-section parameters as a function of anneal temperature, but the decrease in the trap density with increasing anneal temperature demonstrates a damage recovery.","chemistry_names":   [

 {"abstract":"Intrinsic stresses due to lattice mismatch and high densities of threading dislocations and extrinsic stresses resulting from the mismatch in the coefficients of thermal expansion are present in almost all III-Nitride heterostructures. Stress relaxation in the GaN layers occurs in conventional and in pendeo-epitaxial films via the formation of additional misfit dislocations, domain boundaries, elastic strain and wing tilt. Polychromatic X-ray microdiffraction, high resolution monochromatic X-ray diffraction and finite element simulations have been used to determine the distribution of strain, dislocations, sub-boundaries and crystallographic wing tilt in uncoalesced and coalesced GaN layers grown by maskless pendeo-epitaxy. An important parameter was the width-to-height ratio of the etched columns of GaN from which the lateral growth of the wings occurred. The strain and tilt across the stripes increased with the width-to-height ratio. Tilt boundaries formed in the uncoalesced GaN layers at the column/wing interfaces for samples with a large ratio. Sharper tilt boundaries were observed at the interfaces formed by the coalescence of two laterally growing wings. The wings tilted upward during cooling to room temperature for both the uncoalesced and the coalesced GaN layers. It was determined that finite element simulations that account for extrinsic stress relaxation can explain the experimental results for uncoalesced GaN layers. Relaxation of both extrinsic and intrinsic stress components in the coalesced GaN layers contribute to the observed wing tilt and the formation of sub-boundaries.","chemistry_names":   [
