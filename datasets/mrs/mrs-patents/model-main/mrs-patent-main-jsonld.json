        "text": "Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene fibers can be utilized as a tread base rubber in tires in order to improve their heat build-up and wear characteristics. However, in order for the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to provide the desired combination of properties, it is essential for it to be in fibrous form. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,274,462 discloses pneumatic tires having improved resistance against heat build-up which employ syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene fibers in their tread base rubber. Various techniques for synthesizing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in organic solvents and water are known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,901,868 reveals a process for producing a polymer consisting essentially of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene by the successive steps of: (a) preparing a catalyst component solution by dissolving, in an inert organic solvent containing 1,3-butadiene, a cobalt compound, soluble in the organic solvent, such as (i) cobalt-Î²-diketone complex, (ii) cobalt-Î²-keto acid ester complex, (iii) cobalt salt of organic carboxylic acid, and (iv) halogenated cobalt-ligand compound complex, and an organoaluminum compound, (b) preparing a catalyst composition by mixing the catalyst component solution with an alcohol, ketone or aldehyde compound and carbon disulfide, (c) providing a polymerization mixture containing desired amounts of 1,3-butadiene, the catalyst composition and an inert organic solvent, and (d) polymerizing 1,3-butadiene at a temperature of -20Â° C. to 90Â° C. U.S. Pat. No. 4,429,085 reveals a process for producing polybutadiene composed essentially of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in an aqueous medium comprising polymerizing 1,3-butadiene in said aqueous medium in the presence of (1) a catalyst composition microencapsulated in a polyene product which contains (a) at least one cobalt compound selected from the group consisting of (i) Î²-diketone complexes of cobalt, (ii) Î²-keto acid ester complexes of cobalt, (iii) cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids having 6 to 15 carbon atoms, and (iv) complexes of halogenated cobalt compounds of the formula CoXn, wherein X represents a halogen atom and n represents 2 or 3, with an organic compound selected from the group consisting of tertiary amine alcohols, tertiary phosphines, ketones and N,N-dialkylamides, and (b) at least one organoaluminum compound of the formula AlR3, wherein R represents a hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms; and (2) carbon disulfide. After the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is synthesized utilizing a conventional technique, it is necessary to convert it to fibrous form. This is generally done utilizing hot mill flexing and/or extrusion techniques. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a technique for synthesizing fibrous syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene directly without the necessity of utilizing a hot mill flexing or extrusion step. In other words, by utilizing the technique of this invention, syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene fibers can be made directly in the polymerization step. By practicing the process of the present invention, the need to use extrusion or hot mill flexing in order to produce fibrous syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is eliminated. In practicing the present invention, 1,3-butadiene monomer is polymerized in the presence of a liquid polymer and/or naphthenic oil. The presence of the liquid polymer or naphthenic oil during the polymerization causes the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene formed to be in fibrous form. The process of the present invention can be practiced by simply dissolving a liquid polymer or naphthenic oil in 1,3-butadiene monomer followed by polymerizing the 1,3-butadiene monomer utilizing a conventional technique. In fact, fibrous syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene can be synthesized utilizing the technique of the present invention in either water or an inert organic solvent. The present invention more specifically reveals a process for directly preparing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene fibers comprising polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer in the presence of (1) a catalyst composition which is comprised of (a) a cobalt compound and (b) an organoaluminum compound: (2) carbon disulfide: and (3) at least one member selected from the group consisting of liquid polymers and naphthenic oils. The present invention more specifically relates to a process for directly preparing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene fibers comprising: (1) preparing a monomer component solution by dissolving at least one member selected from the group consisting of liquid polymers and naphthenic oils in 1,3-butadiene monomer; (2) preparing a polymerization mixture by mixing said monomer component solution, a catalyst composition which is comprised of (a) a cobalt compound and (b) an organoaluminum compound, and carbon disulfide throughout a liquid medium: and (3) allowing said 1,3-butadiene to polymerize in said polymerization mixture into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene fibers. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The catalysts and polymerization conditions utilized in the polymerizations of this invention are the same as those utilized in conventional synthesis techniques for preparing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene, except for the fact that the polymerizations of this invention are conducted in the presence of a liquid polymer and/or naphthenic oil. A conventional synthesis technique for preparing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in an inert organic solvent is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,901,868 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A conventional process for preparing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in an aqueous medium is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,429,085, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The process of the present invention can be practiced by dissolving the liquid polymer and/or naphthenic oil in the 1,3-butadiene monomer prior to polymerization. In other words, the 1,3-butadiene is mixed with the liquid polymer and/or naphthenic oil prior to charging the 1,3-butadiene into the polymerization medium being utilized (before the 1,3-butadiene comes into contact with the catalyst). In effect, the 1,3-butadiene monomer is charged into the polymerization mixture as a monomer component solution which is prepared by dissolving the liquid polymer and/or naphthenic oil in 1,3-butadiene monomer. The monomer component solutions utilized in the process of the present invention will normally have a ratio of 1,3-butadiene to liquid polymer and/or naphthenic oil of from about 1:100 to 10:1. It is generally preferred for the ratio of monomer to liquid polymer and/or naphthenic oil to be from 1:10 to 4:1 with the most preferred ratio being from 1:4 to 1:1. The liquid polymers which are utilized in the process of the present invention have molecular weights which are low enough for them to be in the liquid state at standard temperature and pressure (S.T.P.). Normally, such liquid polymers will have molecular weights of from about 1,000 to about 200,000. More commonly, the liquid polymers utilized in practicing the process of this invention will have molecular weights of 2,000 to 10,000. The liquid polymers which are most preferred for utilization in the process of the present invention have molecular weights of 3,000 to 7,000. These liquid polymers will commonly be polydienes (polymers which are comprised of repeat units which are derived from one or more diene monomers). For instance, liquid polybutadiene or liquid polyisoprene can be utilized as the liquid polymer. Liquid polymers which are comprised of repeat units which are derived from one or more diene monomers and one or more vinylaromatic monomers can also be utilized in the process of this invention. For instance, liquid styrene-butadiene rubber can be utilized as the liquid polymer. Polysiloxane can also be used as the liquid polymer. The naphthenic oils that can be used include those commonly used to extend rubber. The catalysts used in practicing the process of this invention are prepared by dissolving at least one cobalt compound and at least one organoaluminum compound in an inert organic solvent containing at least one polyene monomer dissolved therein. The term \"an inert organic solvent\" as used herein refers to an organic solvent chemically inert to all of the catalyst components used in the process of the present invention, 1,3-butadiene and the butadiene polymer. Some representative examples of inert organic solvents include aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, alicyclic hydrocarbons, halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, and mixtures of two or more of the above-mentioned compounds. The aromatic hydrocarbons may be benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, diethylbenzene or isobutylbenzene; and the aliphatic hydrocarbons may be n-hexane, isohexanes, n-heptane, n-octane, isooctanes, n-decane, 2,2-dimethylbutane, petroleum ether, kerosene, petroleum spirit or petroleum naphtha, and the alicyclic hydrocarbon may be either cyclohexane or methylcyclohexane. The halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon may be chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzenes or trichlorobenzenes. The cobalt compound usable for the process of the present invention is soluble in an inert organic solvent selected from the group consisting of i. Î²-diketone complexes of cobalt: ii. Î²-keto acid ester complexes of cobalt; iii. cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acid having 1 to 25 carbon atoms, and iv. complexes of halogenated cobalt compounds of the formula: CoXn wherein X represents a halogen atom and n represents 2 or 3, with an organic compound selected from the group consisting of tertiary amines, alcohols, tertiary phosphines, ketones and N,N-dialkylamindes. The Î²-diketone compound to form a complex with a cobalt atom is of the formula: ##STR1## wherein R1 and R4, which are the same as or different from one another, are an alkyl radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms and R2 and R3, which are the same as or different from one another, are a hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. This type of Î²-diketone complex of cobalt may be cobalt (II) acetylacetonate or cobalt (III) acetylacetonate. The Î²-keto acid ester to form a complex with a cobalt atom may be of the formula: ##STR2## wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 are the same as defined above. This type of cobalt complex may be a cobalt-acetoacetic acid ethyl ester complex. The cobalt salt of organic carboxylic acid may be either cobalt octoate or cobalt naphthenate. In the ligand compounds capable of forming a complex with a halogenated cobalt compound, the tertiary amine may be pyridine, triethylamine, tributylamine or dimethylaniline, the alcohol may be methyl alcohol or ethyl alcohol, the tertiary phosphine may be trimethyl phosphine, tributyl phosphine or triphenyl phosphine, the ketone may be acetone or methyl ethyl ketone and the N,N-dialkylamide may be N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-diethylformamide or N,N-diethylacetamide. The complex of halogenated cobalt is preferably either a complex of cobalt chloride with pyridine or ethyl alcohol. The organoaluminum compound usable for the process of the present invention is of the formula AlR3 wherein R represents a hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms. They hydrocarbon radical may be an alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Preferably, the organoaluminum compound may be trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum or triphenylaluminum. In the preparation of the catalyst component solution, it is important that the cobalt compound and the organoaluminum compound are dissolved in the inert organic solvent containing at least one polyene. Some polyenes that can be used in the formation of the polyene products used to prepare microencapsulated catalysts are 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, isoprene, myrcene, and 1,5-cyclooctadiene. Polyenes in which at least two of the double bonds are conjugated and which have minimal substitution on the double bonds are preferred, particularly 1,3-butadiene. Other olefins which can be used are those which are capable of serving as chelating agents for transition metals, such as 1,5-cyclooctadiene. Polyenes with neither conjugation nor good chelating potential are much less effective. If the preparation is carried out in the absence of a polyene, the resultant catalyst component solution is not effective as a component of the catalyst composition of the present invention. The polyene is preferably used in a ratio by mole of at least 1.0, more preferably, at least 5.0 to the amount by mole of the cobalt compound to be used in the catalyst component solution. The preferred polyenes for use in this invention are 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, isoprene, and myrcene. The most preferred polyene is 1,3-butadiene. Generally, the larger the ratio of the amount of polyene to the cobalt compound in the catalyst component solution, the higher the activity of the catalyst. However, the activity of the catalyst reaches a maximum value at a ratio by mole of polyene monomer to the cobalt compound used in the catalyst component solution of between 10 and 200. For example, if a molar ratio of polyene monomer to the cobalt compound of 10,000 is employed the activity of the catalyst will be similar to that of the catalyst prepared from a catalyst component solution containing a ratio of polyene monomer to the cobalt compound of from 10 to 200. If the ratio is less than 1.0, the resultant catalyst composition has poor activity. The catalyst component solution is preferably prepared at a temperature of 10Â° to 50Â° C. and preferably contains 0.0005 to 1.0% by mole, more preferably 0.001 to 0.5% by mole, of the cobalt compound. 0.001 to 10% by mole, more preferably, 0.03 to 5% by mole of the organoaluminum compound based on the amount by mole of 1,3-butadiene to be polymerized. The ratio by mole of the organoaluminum compound to the cobalt compound is preferably in a range from 0.5 to 50, more preferably, from 0.2 to 10. In the preparation of the catalyst component solution it is preferred for the cobalt compound to be first dissolved in the inert organic solvent in the presence of the polyene monomer and then for the organoaluminum compound to be added to the solution. However, very satisfactory results can also be obtained when the organoaluminum compound is added first. In the preparation of this catalyst component solution the organoaluminum compound should not be allowed to come in contact with water. This is because water can completely decompose such organoaluminum compounds. Accordingly, it is preferable that the inert organic solvent to be used to prepare the catalyst component solution be preliminarily dehydrated at least up to a content of water which is insufficient to completely decompose the entire amount of the organoaluminum compound. It is preferable that the catalyst component solution be prepared using a dehydrated inert organic solvent. However, a trace of water in the inert organic solvent can be present up to a concentration of about 500 ppm (parts per million by weight). In fact, it is believed that the total elimination of water from such a catalyst component solution is undesirable. It is preferred for no more than 200 ppm of water to be present in the inert organic solvent used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution. If the content of water in the inert organic solvent is larger than 500 ppm, the catalyst component solution has to contain a relatively large amount of the cobalt compound and organoaluminum compound. This results in an economic disadvantage. If a sufficient amount of water is present in the inert organic solvent used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution the catalyst can be completely destroyed. It is desirable to allow the prereaction used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution to run for a period of at least 30 seconds, and more preferably for at least 1 minute before mixing the catalyst component solution with the 1,3-butadiene/water mixture to form the reaction mixture. Longer time periods can be used without the catalyst component solution losing its activity. After the organoaluminum compound has been incorporated in the catalyst component solution using the above-described technique the catalyst is \"protected\" from decomposition by water. This is believed to be due to a microencapsulation of the catalyst by polyene product formed in the prereaction process used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution. It is believed that a hydrophobic shield is formed around the catalyst that water cannot readily penetrate; however, this hydrophobic shield or membrane is probably permeable by the butadiene monomer being polymerized into the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. When 1,3-butadiene is used as the polyene, the butadiene product which microencapsulates the catalyst is believed to be a butadiene monomer complex, an oligomerized butadiene or a polymer of butadiene. It has been determined that this protection is sufficient to allow for the use of this catalyst component solution in an aqueous suspension polymerization of butadiene into 1,3-polybutadiene of syndiotactic crystallinity. The microencapsulated catalyst formed can, of course, also be used to catalyze the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer in inert organic mediums. A reaction mixture can be prepared by mixing a catalyst component solution with a monomer component solution. Normally, the monomer component solution will be diluted in a liquid medium. The liquid medium can be an inert organic solvent or water. It is also possible to utilize a liquid polymer and/or naphthenic oil as the liquid medium. The reaction mixture prepared can contain from as little as about 2% 1,3-butadiene to as much as about 50% 1,3-butadiene by weight based upon the total weight of the reaction mixture. It is preferred for the reaction mixture to contain from 15% to 35% by weight butadiene, and it is more preferred for it to contain 20% to 25% butadiene by weight. Since 1,3-butadiene is very volatile, it will be necessary to prepare this mixture in a closed system. Agitation should be provided in the preparation of the reaction mixture in order to insure that the catalyst component solution and 1,3-butadiene are distributed essentially homogeneously throughout the mixture. Since 1,3-butadiene is essentially insoluble in water it will be present in aqueous systems in the form of droplets which are distributed throughout the mixture. If agitation is discontinued there will be a separation of the organic and aqueous components in such aqueous mixtures into two layers. The organic and aqueous layers of such aqueous reaction mixtures can be mixed together again by agitating the reaction mixture. A polymerization mixture can be prepared by mixing carbon disulfide throughout the above-described reaction mixture. The amount of carbon disulfide that can be added will vary between 0.005 mole percent and 2 mole percent based on the amount of moles of 1,3-butadiene to be polymerized in the polymerization mixture. More preferably the amount of carbon disulfide added will vary between 0.001 and 1 mole percent based on the amount of moles of 1,3-butadiene to be polymerized in the polymerization mixture. In the process of the present invention, the larger the proportion of the carbon disulfide in a range from about 0.0005 to about 0.5% by mole based on the amount by mole of the 1,3-butadiene to be polymerized in the polymerization mixture, the larger the yield of the polymer product obtained from the polymerization mixture. However, too large an amount of carbon disulfide, for example, larger than 0.5% by mole, causes a decrease in the polymer yield. In the process of the present invention the crystallinity and melting point of the polybutadiene produced can be controlled by adding alcohols, ketones, nitriles, aldehydes, or amides to the polymerization mixture. In this aqueous suspension polymerization process there is a limitation of controlling crystallinity and melting point with agents which are water-soluble. Thus ethanol and methanol are not as effective as other alcohols which are much less soluble in water than in hydrocarbons. Water soluble agents can not be used effectively to control crystallinity and melting point (only hydrocarbon soluble agents can be used). A detailed description of the agents and techniques that are used to control crystallinity and melting points is given in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,901,868 and 4,153,767. These patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. As has been pointed out, water soluble agents, such as ethanol and methanol, are not effective agents. Other alcohols such as, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 1-decanol, and 5-tridecanol, which are not soluble in water, have been used very successfully. In the final step of this process the 1,3-butadiene monomer in the polymerization mixture is converted into polybutadiene while agitating the polymerization mixture. If the use of an antioxidant is desired, it may be added conveniently at the beginning of the polymerization. This polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer can be carried out at a temperature from about -20Â° C. to about 90Â° C. It is preferable for the polymerization temperature to be from 0Â° C. to 40Â° C. The most preferred polymerization temperature is about 10Â° C. At temperatures below 0Â° C. an antifreeze agent can be added to the polymerization mixture to keep it from freezing. This polymerization can be carried out either under a normal pressure or in a pressurized system. This polymerization can be carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere with good results. Such a polymerization can be run for a period of from about 1 to about 30 hours. It is generally preferred for the polymerization to be run for about 10 hours. However, the optimum polymerization time will vary greatly with the polymerization temperature, catalyst, the amount of catalyst used, etc. The polybutadiene formed using the process of this invention will float to the surface of the polymerization mixture and can easily be recovered. Various embodiments of the process of the present invention in practice are illustrated by the following working examples. These examples are intended merely to illustrate the present invention and not in any sense to limit the scope in which the present invention can be practiced. Unless specifically indicated otherwise, parts and percentages are given by weight. EXAMPLE 1 A typical non-aqueous polymerization utilizing the process of this invention was carried out by charging 35 grams of liquid polybutadiene having a molecular weight of about 5,000, 0.25 grams of 2,6-di-t-butyl-p-cresol, and 25 grams (after venting) of 1,3-butadiene monomer into an 8-ounce (227 gram) polymerization bottle. The bottle was capped with a self-seal lined cap and tumbled in a constant temperature bath maintained at 10Â° C. for about 1 hour. The liquid polymer dissolved into the 1,3-butadiene monomer. This polymerization was initiated by charging cobalt octanoate, triethyl aluminum and carbon disulfide into the polymerization bottle. This was done by charging 1.5 ml. of a 0.08 M (molar) solution of cobalt octanoate and triethyl aluminum having a molar ratio of aluminum to cobalt of 4:1 into the bottle followed by charging 0.6 ml. of a 0.2 M solution of carbon disulfide into it. The polymerization bottle was allowed to remain in the constant temperature bath for a period of 18 hours, during which time the polymerization mixture had set up. A yield of 60 grams of a semi-transparent hard rubber-like blend was obtained which consisted of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene embedded in a liquid polymer matrix. The syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene rubber particles formed could not be observed by the naked eye, but extraction of the liquid polybutadiene with toluene from a weighed sample of the blend gave the theoretical amount of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene having a melting point of 190Â° C. Microscopy studies at 30,000 magnification showed that the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene produced to be in the form of fibers. These fibers were determined to have diameters of about 100 â„« (angstroms) and lengths in the range of about 700 to 1,700 â„«. It should be noted that in the liquid polybutadiene/syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene matrices formed, no free liquid polymer was found. This proved to be the case even when the ratio of liquid polybutadiene to 1,3-butadiene monomer charged is as high as 2:1. Additionally, such blends did not have an \"oil-like feel.\" This example clearly shows that syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene can be produced in fibrous form directly eliminating the need for a separate extrusion or stretching step. EXAMPLE 2 The procedure specified in Example 1 was repeated in this experiment except that 40 grams of silicon oil was substituted for the 35 grams of liquid polybutadiene utilized in Example 1. An additional difference between the two procedures is that in this Example, the polymerization was allowed to continue for about 20 hours. The rubber blend produced in this experiment was washed with isopropanol and dried. A 59 gram yield of an opaque flexible material was obtained. It was determined by microscopy that the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene produced in this experiment was in fibrous form. EXAMPLE 3 In this Example, syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene fibers were synthesized in an aqueous medium. This was done by charging 35 grams of liquid polybutadiene, 0.25 grams of 2,6-di-t-butyl-p-cresol, 30 ml. of distilled water, and 25 grams of 1,3-butadiene monomer into an 8-ounce (227 gram) polymerization bottle. The polymerization bottle was then tumbled in a constant temperature bath for 90 minutes at a temperature of 10Â° C. The mixture in the polymerization bottle was then treated with the co-catalysts specified in Example 1. The 1,3-butadiene monomer was allowed to polymerize for about 20 hours. The polymer blend produced fell out of the polymerization bottle as a large solid mass rather than as suspended particles. Isolation and drying of the rubber blend yielded 57 grams of product. A sample of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was studied by microscopy. It was again determined that the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene produced was in fibrous form. These examples clearly show that by utilizing the technique of the present invention, syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene fibers can be produced directly during polymerization. While certain representative embodiments and details have been shown for the purpose of illustrating the invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in this art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the scope of this invention."

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene (SPBD) is a thermoplastic polymer which can be utilized in a wide variety of applications. For example, the incorporation of SPBD into rubber compositions which are utilized in the supporting carcass or innerliner of tires greatly improves the green strength of those compositions. Electron beam precure (microwave precure) is a technique which has gained wide commercial acceptance as a means of improving the green strength of synthetic elastomers which are used in building tires. However, electron beam precure techniques are costly. The incorporation of SPBD into blends of such synthetic elastomers can often improve green strength to the degree that electron beam precure is not required. The incorporation of SPBD into halogenated butyl rubbers which are utilized as the innerliner compositions for tires also greatly improves the scorch safety of such compositions. U.S. Pat. No. 4,274,462 disclosed that pneumatic tires having improved resistance against heat build-up can be prepared by utilizing SPBD fibers in their tread base rubber. SPBD can also be molded into a wide variety of useful articles. Techniques for preparing SPBD by solution polymerization and by suspension polymerization are known in the art. A process is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,778,424 for the preparation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene which comprises polymerizing 1,3-butadiene in an organic solvent in the presence of a catalyst composition composed of: (a) a cobalt compound, (b) an organoaluminum compound of the formula AlR3, in which R is a hydrocarbon radical of 1-6 carbons, and (c) carbon disulfide. U.S. Pat. No. 3,901,868 reveals a process for producing a butadiene polymer consisting essentially of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene by the successive steps of: (a) preparing a catalyst component solution by dissolving, in an inert organic solvent containing 1,3-butadiene, a cobalt compound, soluble in the organic solvent, such as (i) cobalt-Î²-diketone complex, (ii) cobalt-Î²-keto acid ester complex, (iii) cobalt salt of organic carboxylic acid, and (iv) halogenated cobalt-ligand compound complex, and an organoaluminum compound, (b) preparing a catalyst composition by mixing the catalyst component solution with an alcohol, ketone or aldehyde compound and carbon disulfide, (c) providing a polymerization mixture containing desired amounts of 1,3-butadiene, the catalyst composition and an inert organic solvent, and (d) polymerizing 1,3-butadiene at a temperature of -20Â° C. to 90Â° C. U.S. Pat. No. 4,429,085 discloses a process for producing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene by suspension polymerization in an aqueous medium. In this aqueous polymerization process polybutadiene which has an essentially syndiotactic 1,2-microstructure is made by the steps of: (A) preparing a catalyst component solution by dissolving, in an inert organic solvent containing 1,3-butadiene (a) at least one cobalt compound selected from the group consisting of (i) Î²-diketone complexes of cobalt, (ii) Î²-keto acid ester complexes of cobalt, (iii) cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids having 6 to 15 carbon atoms, and (iv) complexes of halogenated cobalt compounds of the formula CoXn, wherein X represents a halogen atom and n represents 2 or 3, with an organic compound selected from the group consisting of tertiary amine alcohols, tertiary phosphines, ketones, and N,N-dialkylamides, and (b) at least one organoaluminum compound of the formula AlR3, wherein R represents a hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms: (B) preparing a reaction mixture by mixing said catalyst component solution with a 1,3-butadiene/water mixture containing desired amounts of said 1,3-butadiene: (C) preparing a polymerization mixture by mixing carbon disulfide throughout said reaction mixture, and (D) polymerizing said 1,3-butadiene in said polymerization mixture into polybutadiene while agitating said polymerization mixture. U.S. Pat. No. 4,751,275 discloses a process for the preparation of SPBD by the solution polymerization of 1,3-butadiene in a hydrocarbon polymerization medium, such as benzene, toluene, cyclohexane, or n-hexane. The catalyst system used in this solution polymerization contains a chromium-III compound which is soluble in hydrocarbons, a trialkylaluminum compound, and a dialkylphosphite, such as di-neopentylphosphite or di-butylphosphite. Heretofore, blends of SPBD with rubbery elastomers have been prepared utilizing standard mixing techniques. For instance, SPBD can be mixed throughout a rubbery elastomer utilizing a Banbury mixer or a mill mixer. However, these standard mixing procedures have certain drawbacks. These drawbacks include high processing costs, polymer degradation, inadequate mixing, and process limitations. The processing equipment required in order to mix SPBD throughout rubbery elastomers by mastication is also expensive and very costly to operate. Such standard mixing procedures result in polymer degradation due to the high shearing forces and high temperatures which may be required for mixing. For instance, it is generally desirable to mix the SPBD throughout the rubbery elastomer at a temperature which is above the melting point of the SPBD. Accordingly, SPBD powder, which is utilized in tire innerliner or carcass compounds, is mixed into the compound utilizing standard mixing procedures at a temperature which is at least as high as the melting point of the SPBD being used. Since high mixing temperatures result in degradation of the rubbery elastomer being utilized as the innerliner or carcass compound, the melting point of the SPBD utilized has typically been limited to no more than about 190Â° C. In order to limit polymer degradation, the SPBD utilized in such applications typically has a melting point of no more than about 160Â° C. Even though the green strength of tire carcass compounds containing SPBD increases with the melting temperature of the SPBD, the higher mixing temperature associated with the higher melting SPBD makes its utilization very difficult because of the degradation that occurs utilizing standard mixing techniques. Furthermore, good dispersions of SPBD throughout rubbers are difficult to attain utilizing conventional mixing techniques. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a process for producing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene latex. It more specifically discloses a process for producing a syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene latex which comprises polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer in an aqueous medium in the presence of (1) at least one emulsifier: (2) a catalyst emulsion composition which is comprised of (a) at least one cobalt compound selected from the group consisting of (i) Î²-ketone complexes of cobalt, (ii) Î²-keto acid ester complexes of cobalt, (iii) cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids having 6 to 15 carbon atoms, and (iv) complexes of halogenated cobalt compounds of the formula CoXn, wherein X represents a halogen atom and n represents 2 or 3, with an organic compound selected from the group consisting of tertiary amine alcohols, tertiary phosphines, ketones and N,N-dialkylamides, and (b) at least one organoaluminum compound of the formula AlR3 wherein R represents a hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, wherein said catalyst composition is microencapsulated in a polyene product and wherein said catalyst emulsion composition is microfluidized in an oil to a particle size which is within the range of about 10 nanometers to about 1000 nanometers; and (3) at least one member selected from the group consisting of carbon disulfide and phenyl isothiocyanate. The subject invention also reveals a process for preparing a syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene latex by emulsion polymerization which comprises polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer in an aqueous reaction mixture which is comprised of (1) water, (2) at least one emulsifier, (3) 1,3-butadiene monomer, (4) a catalyst emulsion composition which is prepared by dissolving in an inert organic solvent containing at least one polyene (a) at least one cobalt compound selected from the group consisting of (i) Î²-ketone complexes of cobalt, (ii) Î²-keto acid ester complexes of cobalt, (iii) cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids having 6 to 15 carbon atoms, and (iv) complexes of halogenated cobalt compounds of the formula CoXn, wherein X represents a halogen atom and n represents 2 or 3, with an organic compound selected from the group consisting of tertiary amine alcohols, tertiary phosphines, ketones and N,N-dialkylamides, and (b) at least one organoaluminum compound of the formula AlR3 wherein R represents a hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms to produce a catalyst component solution, and microfluidizing the catalyst component solution with an oil, a surfactant, and water to an average particle size which is within the range of about 10 nanometers to about 1000 nanometers: and (5) at least one member selected from the group consisting of carbon disulfide and phenyl isothiocyanate. The subject invention further discloses a catalyst emulsion composition which is useful in the emulsion polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene, which is prepared by dissolving in an inert organic solvent containing at least one polyene (a) at least one cobalt compound selected from the group consisting of (i) Î²-ketone complexes of cobalt, (ii) Î²-keto acid ester complexes of cobalt, (iii) cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids having 6 to 15 carbon atoms, and (iv) complexes of halogenated cobalt compounds of the formula CoXn, wherein X represents a halogen atom and n represents 2 or 3, with an organic compound selected from the group consisting of tertiary amine alcohols, tertiary phosphines, ketones and N,N-dialkylamides, and (b) at least one organoaluminum compound of the formula AlR3 wherein R represents a hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms to produce a catalyst component solution, and microfluidizing the catalyst component solution with an oil, a surfactant, and water to an average particle size which is within the range of about 10 nanometers to about 1000 nanometers. The latices made by the process of this invention can be utilized in preparing blends of SPBD with rubbery elastomers. This can be done by simply mixing the SPBD latex with the latex of a rubber. For instance, an SPBD/styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) blend can be prepared by simply mixing the SPBD latex with an SBR latex. The SPBD/SBR blend can then be recovered utilizing conventional coagulation techniques. By utilizing this technique, all of the drawbacks associated with conventional blending of dry SPBD with dry rubbers are overcome. Blends of SPBD with various rubbery elastomers can also be prepared by utilizing the SPBD latex as the polymerization medium for preparing other emulsion rubbers. For instance, a blend of SPBD with SBR can be prepared by adding styrene monomer, 1,3-butadiene monomer, emulsifiers, and an appropriate initiator to a SPBD latex. The SBR is accordingly prepared by emulsion polymerization in the SPBD latex. This results in the formation of a latex which contains both SPBD and SBR. The SPBD/SBR blend can be recovered by simply coagulating the latex. The SPBD latices made in accordance with this invention are also valuable for utilization in other applications. For instance, SPBD powders having a very small particle size can be prepared by simply drying the SPBD latex. SPBD made utilizing other polymerization techniques must be ground in order to obtain small particle size powders. The SPBD latices of this invention can also be applied to substrates and allowed to dry. This provides the substrate with a thin coating of the SPBD. For instance, rubber slabs can be dipped in SPBD latex to prevent them from sticking together. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A catalyst emulsion composition is utilized to catalyze the emulsion polymerizations of this invention. A catalyst component solution is utilized in preparing such catalyst emulsion compositions. The catalyst component solution is prepared by dissolving at least one cobalt compound and at least one organoaluminum compound in an inert organic solvent containing at least one polyene monomer which is dissolved therein. The term \"an inert organic solvent\" used herein refers to an organic solvent chemically inert to all of the catalyst components, the emulsifier, the 1,3-butadiene and the SPBD. Some representative examples of inert organic solvents include aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, alicyclic hydrocarbons, halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, and mixtures of two or more of the above-mentioned compounds. Some representative examples of aromatic hydrocarbons that can be utilized include benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, diethylbenzene or isobutylbenzene. The aliphatic hydrocarbons which can be used include n-hexane, isohexanes, n-heptane, n-octane, isooctanes, n-decane, 2,2-dimethylbutane, petroleum ether, kerosene, petroleum spirit or petroleum naphtha. The alicyclic hydrocarbons that can be used include cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane. Some representative examples of halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons that can be used include chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzenes or trichlorobenzenes. The cobalt compound usable for the process of the present invention is soluble in an inert organic solvent selected from the group consisting of (i) Î²-diketone compounds: (ii) Î²-keto acid ester complexes of cobalt; (iii) cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids having 1 to 25 carbon atoms, and (iv) complexes of halogenated cobalt compounds of the formula CoXn wherein X represents a halogen atom and n represents 2 or 3, with an organic compound selected from the group consisting of tertiary amines, alcohols, tertiary phosphines, ketones and N,N-dialkylamides. The Î²-diketone compound which can be used to form a complex with a cobalt atom is of the formula: ##STR1## wherein R1 and R4, which are the same as or different from one another, are an alkyl radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms and R2 and R3, which are the same as or different from one another, are a hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. This type of Î²-diketon complex of cobalt may be cobalt (II) acetylacetonate or cobalt (III) acetylacetonate. The Î²-keto acid ester which can be used to form a complex with a cobalt atom may be of the formula: ##STR2## wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 are the same as defined above. This type of cobalt complex may be a cobalt-acetoacetic acid ethyl ester complex. Some representative examples of cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids that can be used include cobalt octoate and cobalt naphthanate. In the ligand compounds capable of forming a complex with a halogenated cobalt compound, the tertiary amine may be pyridine, triethylamine, tributylamine or dimethylaniline, the alcohol may be ethyl alcohol methyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, or n-butyl alcohol, the tertiary phosphine may be trimethyl phosphine, tributyl phosphine or triphenyl phosphine, the ketone may be acetone or methyl ethyl ketone and the N,N-dialkylamide may be N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-diethylformamide or N,N-diethylacetamide. The complex of halogenated cobalt is preferably either a complex of cobalt chloride with pyridine or ethyl alcohol. The organoaluminum compound usable for the process of the present invention is of the formula AlR3 wherein R represents a hydrocarbon radical containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The hydrocarbon radical may be an alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl radical containing from about 1 to about 6 carbon atoms. Preferably, the organoaluminum compound will be trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum triisobutylaluminum or triphenylaluminum. In the preparation of the catalyst component solution, it is important that the cobalt compound and the organoaluminum compound are dissolved in the inert organic solvent containing at least one polyene. Some polyenes that can be used in the formation of the polyene products used to prepare microencapsulated catalysts are 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, isoprene, myrcene and 1,5-cyclooctadiene. Polyenes in which at least two of the double bonds are conjugated and which have minimal substitution on the double bonds are preferred, particularly 1,3-butadiene. Other olefins which can be used are those which are capable of serving as chelating agents for transition metals, such as 1,5-cyclooctadiene. Polyenes with neither conjugation nor good chelating potential are much less effective. If the preparation is carried out in the absence of a polyene, the resultant catalyst component solution is not effective as a component of the catalyst composition of the present invention. The polyene is preferably used in a ratio by mole of at least 1.0, more preferably, at least 5.0 to the amount by mole of the cobalt compound to be used in the catalyst component solution. The preferred polyenes for use in this invention are 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, isoprene, and myrcene. The most preferred polyene is 1,3-butadiene. Generally, the larger the ratio of the amount of polyene to the cobalt compound in the catalyst component solution, the higher the activity of the catalyst. However, the activity of the catalyst reaches a maximum value at a ratio by mole of polyene monomer to the cobalt compound used in the catalyst component solution of between 10 and 200. For example, if a molar ratio of polyene monomer to the cobalt compound of 10,000 is employed, the activity of the catalyst will be similar to that of the catalyst prepared from a catalyst component solution containing a ratio of polyene monomer to the cobalt compound of from 10 to 200. If the ratio is less than 1.0, the resultant catalyst composition has poor activity. The catalyst component solution is preferably prepared at a temperature of -10Â° C. to 50Â° C. and preferably contains 0.0005 to 1.0% by mole, more preferably 0.001 to 0.5% by mole, of the cobalt compound. The temperature at which the catalyst component solution is prepared will more preferably be within the range of 5Â° C. to 25Â° C. and it is also highly desirable to use vigorous agitation in the preparation of the catalyst component solution. Generally, from about 0.001 to 10 mole percent, more preferably from about 0.03 to about 5 mole percent of the organoaluminum compounds is utilized, based on the amount of 1,3-butadiene to be polymerized. The ratio by mole of the organoaluminum compound to the cobalt compound is preferably in a range from 0.2 to 50, more preferably, within the range of from 0.5 to 10. In the preparation of the catalyst component solution, it is preferred for the cobalt compound to be first dissolved in the inert organic solvent in the presence of the polyene monomer and then for the organoaluminum compound to be added to the solution. However, very satisfactory results can also be obtained when the organoaluminum compound is added first. In the preparation of this catalyst component solution, the organoaluminum compound should not be allowed to come in contact with water. This is because water can completely decompose such organoaluminum compounds. Accordingly, it is preferable that the inert organic solvent to be used to prepare the catalyst component solution be preliminarily dehydrated at least up to a content of water which is insufficient to completely decompose the entire amount of the organoaluminum compound. It is preferable that the catalyst component solution be prepared using a dry (essentially water free) inert organic solvent. However, a trace of water in the inert organic solvent can be present up to a concentration of about 500 ppm (parts per million by weight). In fact, it is believed that the total elimination of water from such a catalyst component solution is undesirable. It is preferred for no more than 200 ppm of water to be present in the inert organic solvent used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution. If the content of water in the inert organic solvent is larger than 500 ppm, the catalyst component solution has to contain a relatively large amount of the cobalt compound and organoaluminum compound. This results in an economic disadvantage. If a sufficient amount of water is present in the inert organic solvent used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution, the catalyst can be completely destroyed. The catalyst component solution will preferably be stored under an inert gas atmosphere, such as nitrogen, in the absence of sunlight or ultraviolet light. It is desirable to allow the prereaction used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution to run for a period of at least 30 seconds, and more preferably for at least 1 minute before mixing the catalyst component solution with the oil, surfactant, and water used in making the catalyst emulsion composition. Longer time periods can be used without the catalyst component solution losing its activity. After the organoaluminum compound has been incorporated in the catalyst component solution using the above-described technique, the catalyst is \"protected\" from decomposition by water. This is believed to be due to a microencapsulation of the catalyst by polyene product formed in the prereaction process used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution. It is believed that a hydrophobic shield is formed around the catalyst that water cannot readily penetrate: however, this hydrophobic shield or membrane is probably permeable by the butadiene monomer being polymerized into the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. When 1,3-butadiene is used as the polyene, the butadiene product which microencapsulates the catalyst is believed to be a butadiene monomer complex, an oligomerized butadiene or a polymer of butadiene. It has been determined that this protection is sufficient to allow for the use of this catalyst component solution in the aqueous emulsion polymerization of butadiene into SPBD. The catalyst emulsion composition is prepared by microfluidizing or microemulsifying the catalyst component solution with an oil, a surfactant and water. In preparing the catalyst emulsion composition, it is highly desirable to first mix the catalyst component solution with the oil and to separately mix the surfactant with the water. The catalyst component solution/oil mixture is then subsequently mixed with the surfactant/water mixture immediately prior to the microfluidization. The ratio of oil to catalyst component solution will normally be within the range of about 0.5 to 30. It is normally preferred for the ratio of oil to catalyst component solution to be within the range of about 1 to about 10 and it is typically most preferred for the oil to catalyst component solution ratio to be within the range of about 2 to about 3. For example, a weight ratio of oil to catalyst component solution of about 2.5:1 is highly preferred. The weight ratio of water to catalyst component solution utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition is typically within the range of about 5 to about 80. It is normally preferred for the weight ratio of water to catalyst component solution to be within the range of about 10 to about 50. In most cases it will be more preferred for the weight ratio of water to catalyst component solution utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition to be within the range of about 20 to about 30. For instance, a weight ratio of water to catalyst component solution of about 27:1 is highly preferred for utilization in preparing the catalyst emulsion compositions of this invention. The weight ratio of surfactant to catalyst component solution utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition will typically be within the range of about 0.001 to about 10. In most cases it will be preferred to utilize a weight ratio of surfactant to catalyst component solution which is within the range of about 0.05 to 5. It is typically more preferred to utilize a ratio of surfactant to catalyst component solution which is within the range of about 0.1 to 0.3. Accordingly, a weight ratio of surfactant to catalyst component solution of about 0.2:1 is highly preferred. The oil utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition will typically be a long chain paraffinic oil. Such oils will generally be mixtures of various long chain hydrocarbons which contain from about 12 to about 28 carbon atoms. It is generally preferred for these compounds to be saturated. The oil will preferably be comprised of hydrocarbon compounds which contain from about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms. It is possible to utilize long chain alcohols which contain from about 12 to about 28 carbon atoms as the oil. The utilization of such alcohols results in the SPBD being synthesized having a lower melting point. It is, accordingly, desirable to use such alcohols as the oil if SPBD having a low melting point is desired. On the other hand, if SPBD having a high melting point is sought, then it will not be desirable to utilize alcohols as the oil. It is, of course, also possible to utilize a combination of paraffinic oils and alcohols to adjust the melting point of the SPBD as desired. The surfactant utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition will normally be an anionic surfactant or a nonionic surfactant. Some representative examples of types of anionic surfactants which can be utilized include carboxylates, alkylbenzene sulfonates, alkane sulfonates, Î²-olefin sulfonates, fatty alcohol sulfates, and oxo-alcohol sulfates. Some representative examples of types of nonionic surfactants which can be utilized include alkylphenol ethoxylates, fatty-alcohol polyethyleneglycol ethers, oxo-alcohol polyethyleneglycol ethers, ethylene oxide polymers, propylene oxide polymers, and fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers. It is generally preferred for the surfactant to be an anionic surfactant with alkyl benzene sulfonates, fatty alcohol sulfates, and oxo-alcohol ether sulfates being most preferred. The alkyl benzene sulfonates which are utilized generally have the structural formula: ##STR3## wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 8 to 18 carbon atoms and preferably wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 10 to 13 carbon atoms. The fatty alcohol sulfates which can be utilized normally have the structural formula: R-O-SO3 Na wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 6 to 28 carbon atoms and preferably wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 11 to 17 carbon atoms. The oxo-alcohol ether sulfates which can be utilized generally have the structural formula: ##STR4## wherein n is an integer from 1 to about 4 and wherein R and R' represent alkyl groups which can be the same or different with the total number of carbon atoms in R and R' ranging from about 11 to about 13. The microfluidization procedure utilized results in the formation of a catalyst emulsion composition which has an average particle size which is within the range of about 10 to about 1,000 nanometers. The catalyst emulsion composition prepared will preferably have an average particle size which is within the range of about 30 to about 600 nanometers and will more preferably have an average particle size which is within the range of about 60 to about 300 nanometers. This microfluidization procedure can be carried out utilizing conventional microfluidizers or other equipment which is capable of homogenizing the catalyst emulsion composition to the desired particle size. For instance, the microfluidization can be carried out utilizing a high pressure pump or series of pumps. Ultrasonic and/or mechanical means can be utilized in the microfluidization procedure. To attain the desired particle size, it may be advantageous to pass the catalyst emulsion composition which is being prepared through the Microfluidizer.SM. more than one time. The catalyst component solution utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition is stable over long periods of time and can be stored for long periods without losing its activity. However, it is highly desirable to utilize the catalyst emulsion composition as soon as possible after it is prepared because the catalyst emulsion composition loses its activity over time. In practice, the catalyst emulsion composition loses essentially all of its activity after about 24 hours of being stored at room temperature. It is, accordingly, important to use the catalyst emulsion composition as soon as possible after its preparation. The aqueous reaction mixture is prepared by mixing (1) water, (2) at least one emulsifier, (3) 1,3-butadiene monomer, (4) the catalyst emulsion composition and (5) carbon disulfide and/or phenylthiocyanate. Water is the major component in the aqueous reaction mixture. The amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer in the aqueous reaction mixture will vary from about 2 weight percent to about 50 weight percent. However, in most cases it will be preferred for the aqueous reaction mixture to contain from about 10 weight percent to about 40 weight percent 1,3-butadiene monomer. It will generally be more preferred for the aqueous reaction mixture to contain from about 20 to about 30 weight percent 1,3-butadiene monomer. The amount of emulsifier utilized in preparing the aqueous reaction mixture will normally be within the range of about 0.1 phm to about 10 phm (parts per hundred parts of monomer). It will normally be preferred for the emulsifier to be present in an amount ranging from about 0.5 phm to about 5 phm. In most cases, it will be more preferred for the emulsifier to be present in an amount within the range of about 1 phm to about 3 phm. The emulsifiers used in the emulsion polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into SPBD may be charged at the outset of the polymerization or may be added incrementally or by proportioning as the reaction proceeds. Generally, anionic emulsifier systems provide good results, however, any of the general types of anionic, cationic or nonionic emulsifiers may be employed in the polymerization. Among the anionic emulsifiers that can be employed in such emulsion polymerizations are fatty acids and their alkali metal soaps such as caprylic acid, capric acid, pelargonic acid, lauric acid, undecyclic acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, and the like: amine soaps of fatty acids such as those formed from ammonia, monoand dialkyl amines, substituted hydrazines, guanidine and various low molecular weight diamines: chain-substituted derivatives of fatty acids such as those having alkyl substituents; naphthenic acids and their soaps and the like: sulfuric esters and their salts, such as the tallow alcohol sulfates, coconut alcohol sulfates, fatty alcohol sulfates, such as oleyl sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate and the like: sterol sulfates: sulfates of alkylcyclohexanols, sulfation products of lower polymers of ethylene as C10 to C20 straight chain olefins, and other hydrocarbon mixtures, sulfuric esters of aliphatic and aromatic alcohols having intermediate linkages, such as ether, ester, or amide groups such as alkylbenzyl (polyethyleneoxy) alcohols, the sodium salt of tridecyl ether sulfate: alkane sulfonates, esters and salts, such as alkylchlorosulfonates with the general formula RSO2 Cl, wherein R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and alkylsulfonates with the general formula RSO2 -OH, wherein R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms: sulfonates with intermediate linkages such as ester and ester-linked sulfonates such as those having the formula RCOOC2 H4 SO3 H and ROOC-CH2 -SO3 H, wherein R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms such as dialkyl sulfosuccinates: ester salts with the general formula: ##STR5## wherein R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms: alkylaryl sulfonates in which the alkyl groups contain preferably from 10 to 20 carbon atoms, e.g. dodecylbenzenesulfonates, such as sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate; alkyl phenol sulfonates: sulfonic acids and their salts such as acids with the formula RSO3 Na, wherein R is an alkyl and the like: sulfonamides: sulfamido methylenesulfonic acids: rosin acids and their soaps: sulfonated derivatives of rosin and rosin oil; and lignin sulfonates, and the like. Carboxylate emulsifiers are highly preferred. This is because their utilization leads to less build-up on the walls of the polymerization reactor. Fatty acid soaps and rosin acid soaps are representative examples of highly preferred carboxylate soaps. Of rosin acids, about 90 percent are isometric with abietic acid and the other 10 percent is a mixture of dehydro abietic acid and dihydro abietic acid. Agitation should be provided in the preparation of the aqueous reaction mixture to ensure that the catalyst emulsion composition, the monomer, and the surfactant are distributed essentially homogeneously throughout the mixture. Since 1,3-butadiene monomer is very volatile, it will be necessary to prepare the aqueous reaction mixture under pressure in a closed system. The carbon disulfide or phenyl isothiocyanate is typically the last component to be added to the aqueous reaction mixture. The addition of carbon disulfide and/or phenyl isothiocyanate to the reaction mixture which already contains the catalyst emulsion composition will initiate the polymerization reaction. The amount of carbon disulfide or phenyl isothiocyanate that can be added will vary between 0.005 phm and 2 phm. More preferably, the amount of carbon disulfide added will vary between 0.001 and 1 phm. In the process of the present invention, the larger the proportion of the carbon disulfide in a range from about 0.0005 phm to about 0.5 phm in the polymerization mixture, the larger the yield of the SPBD obtained from the polymerization mixture. However, too large an amount of carbon disulfide, for example, larger than about 0.5 phm, causes a decrease in the polymer yield. In the process of the present invention, the crystallinity and melting point of the polybutadiene produced can be controlled by adding alcohols, ketones, nitriles, aldehydes, or amides to the aqueous reaction mixture. ln this aqueous emulsion polymerization process, there is a limitation of controlling crystallinity and melting point with agents which are water-soluble. Thus, ethanol and methanol are not as effective as other alcohols which are much less soluble in water than in hydrocarbons. Water soluble agents cannot be used as effectively to control crystallinity and melting point (only hydrocarbon soluble agents can be used). A detailed description of the agents and techniques that are used to control crystallinity and melting points is given in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,901,868 and 4,153,767. These patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. As has been pointed out, water soluble agents, such as ethanol and methanol, are not effective agents. Other alcohols such as, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 1-decanol, and 5-tridecanol, which are not soluble in water, can be used with better success. The 1,3-butadiene monomer is polymerized into SPBD while agitating the polymerization mixture. If the use of an antioxidant is desired, it may be added conveniently at the beginning of the polymerization. This polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer can be carried out at a temperature from about -20Â° C. to about 100Â° C. It is preferable for the polymerization temperature to be from 0Â° C. to 60Â° C. The most preferred polymerization temperature is about 10Â° C. to about 30Â° C. At temperatures below 0Â° C., an antifreeze agent can be added to the polymerization mixture to keep it from freezing. This polymerization can be carried out either under a normal pressure or in a pressurized system. This polymerization can be carried out under an inert gas atmosphere, such as a nitrogen atmosphere, with good results. Such a polymerization can be run for a period of from about 3 to about 30 hours. It is generally preferred for the polymerization to be run for a period which is within the range of about 10 to 16 hours. However, the optimum polymerization time will vary greatly with the polymerization temperature, catalyst, the amount of catalyst used, etc. In most cases, the optimum polymerization time will be within the range of about 12 to about 14 hours. After the polymerization has been completed, the SPBD can be recovered from the latex by standard coagulation techniques. In the alternative, the SPBD latex can be blended with the latices of rubbery elastomers as desired or it can be utilized as the polymerization medium for preparing emulsion rubbers. In any case, the SPBD can be coagulated from the latex by utilizing standard techniques. For instance, coagulation can be accomplished by adding acids or blends of salts with acids to the latex. For example, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, blends of sodium chloride with sulfuric acid and blends of hydrochloric acid with methanol are very effective as coagulating agents. Calcium chloride solutions and blends of calcium chloride with various acids can also be utilized as coagulants. Salt/acid coagulants are generally preferred. For instance, the utilization of sulfuric acid with sodium chloride or potassium chloride as the coagulant will lead to good results. Barium chloride and magnesium sulfate are additional examples of divalent salts which are suitable for utilization in coagulating the SPBD latex. It may also be advantageous to employ materials classified as coagulation aids, such as high molecular weight polyelectrolytes, in the coagulation of the SPBD latex. The preferred coagulation aids are weak bases. Some representative examples of suitable coagulation aids which can be used include Nalco.SM. 108 (Nalco Chemical Company), Daxad.SM. CP-1 (W. R. Grace and Company) and similar materials that are also weakly basic polyelectrolytes. The quantity of coagulant required will vary with the emulsifier, the amount of emulsifier used, the rubber being coagulated, and the type of coagulant being employed. Generally, the optimum type of coagulant, quantity of coagulant and coagulating conditions can be determined using a trial and error approach. If a blend of the SPBD with a rubbery elastomer is sought, then the SPBD latex is mixed with a latex of the rubbery elastomer prior to coagulation. The coagulation of such blended latices results in the formation of a highly dispersed blend of SPBD throughout the rubbery elastomer. The amount of SPBD and rubber in the blend is determined by the amount of the various latices which are mixed together. It is, of course, important for the latices to be compatible with each other to prevent undesired reactions from taking place. Blends of SPBD with a wide variety of rubbery elastomers including high cis-1,4-polybutadiene, synthetic polyisoprene, SBR, isoprene-butadiene rubber, nitrile rubber, butyl rubbers, halogenated butyl rubbers, ethylene propylene diene monomer rubbers (EPDM), and ethylene propylene rubbers (EPR) can be made utilizing this technique. In cases where the SPBD latex is utilized as the polymerization medium for producing emulsion rubbers typically additional water, emulsifiers initiator, and desired monomers will be added thereto. It is, of course, important to select an emulsifier, initiator, and monomers which are compatible with the SPBD latex. The monomers present in the polymerization medium are then polymerized into the rubbery elastomer desired. For instance, this can be done utilizing free radical polymerization techniques. Such polymerizations can be initiated utilizing standard chemical free radical initiators, ultraviolet light, or radiation. To ensure a satisfactory polymerization rate, uniformity. and a controllable polymerization, free radical initiators are generally used with good results. Free radical initiators which are commonly used include the various peroxygen compounds such as potassium persulfate, ammonium persulfate, benzoyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, di-t-butyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl peroxide, decanoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, p-menthane hydroperoxide, t-butylhydroperoxide, acetyl acetone peroxide, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, succinic acid peroxide, dicetyl peroxydicarbonate, t-butyl peroxyacetate, t-butyl peroxymaleic acid, t-butyl peroxybenzoate, acetyl cyclohexyl sulfonyl peroxide and the like: the various azo compounds such as 2-t-butylazo-2-cyanopropane, dimethyl azodiisobutyrate, azodiisobutyronitrile, 2-t-butylazo-1-cyanocyclohexane, 1-t-amylazo-1-cyanocyclohexane, and the like; the various alkyl perketals, such as 2,2-bis-(t-butylperoxy)butane, ethyl 3,3-bis(t-butylperoxy) butyrate, 1,1-di-(t-butylperoxy) cyclohexane, and the like. Cumene hydroperoxide can be used as an initiator to obtain very good results in the polymerization of carboxylated nitrile rubber. The emulsion polymerization system used in the synthesis of carboxylated rubbers can be treated at the desired degree of conversion with shortstopping agents, such as hydroquinone. The latex made can then be coagulated using a standard technique. This results in the formation of a highly dispersed blend of the SPBD throughout the rubbery elastomer. In an alternative embodiment of this invention, SPBD latex can be prepared in the latex of a rubbery elastomer. Such polymerizations are carried out by adding 1,3-butadiene monomer, the catalyst emulsion composition, carbon disulfide and/or phenyl isothiocyanate, and additional emulsifiers if desired to the latex of the rubbery elastomer. A latex containing the SPBD as well as the rubbery elastomer will result. This latex can accordingly be coagulated to form a highly dispersed blend of the SPBD throughout the rubbery elastomer. This invention is illustrated by the following examples which are merely for the purpose of illustration and are not to be regarded as limiting the scope of the invention or the manner in which it can be practiced. Unless specifically indicated otherwise, parts and percentages are given by weight. Particle sizes reported herein were determined utilizing a Nicomp Model 370 dynamic light scattering unit using automatic sample preparation techniques. EXAMPLE 1 In this experiment a latex of SPBD was prepared. The first step of the procedure utilized involved making the catalyst component solution. This was done by charging 7.3 lbs. (3.3 kg) of hexane to a reactor which had been evacuated for 30 minutes. Then 0.61 lbs. (0.28 kg) of cobalt octoate was added with the mixture being agitated. Then 1.3 lbs. (0.59 kg) of 1,3-butadiene was added. After that 3.5 lbs. (1.59 kg) of triethylaluminum was added with the agitation being continued. Cooling was also utilized to keep the temperature of the mixture below about 70Â° F. (21Â° C.). After all of the triethylaluminum had been added and the temperature fell below 50Â° F. (10Â° C.). The catalyst component solution which had been prepared was transferred to a clean plastic 5 gallon (18.9 liter) carboy for storage in a cold room until needed. The catalyst component solution was additionally stored under a blanket of nitrogen in the absence of light. A mixture of the catalyst component solution with a paraffinic oil was then prepared. This was done by mixing 450 grams of the catalyst component solution with 300 grams of a paraffinic process oil. A surfactant solution was also prepared. This was done by mixing 7 lbs. (3.2 kg) of water with 300 grams of an aqueous solution containing 28% sodium lauryl sulfate. The mixture of the oil with the catalyst component solution was then microfluidized with the surfactant solution. This was done in a homogenizer unit made by Microfluidics Corporation. Mixing of the aqueous and organic phases was accomplished utilizing a mixing Tee just ahead of the Microfluidizer.SM. pump. The homogenization process was continued until an average particle size for the catalyst emulsion composition of about 100 nanometers was attained. The catalyst emulsion composition prepared was determined to contain particles which varied in size from about 60 to about 300 nanometers. A buffer solution having a pH of about 9.5 was prepared by mixing 20 lbs. (9.1 kg) of water with 1.8 lbs. (0.82 kg) of a tallow fatty acid. The buffer solution was added to a polymerization reactor and 12.5 lbs. (5.7 kg) of 1,3-butadiene monomer was charged into the reactor. The reactor was equipped with two afts with baffles for agitation which was carried out at 150 rpm. The catalyst emulsion composition prepared was charged into the reactor along with 9 grams of carbon disulfide which was dissolved in 391 grams of hexane. The polymerization was carried out at a temperature of about 50Â° F. (10Â° C.) for a period of 12 to 14 hours. A stable SPBD latex having a solids content of above 20% was produced. EXAMPLE 2 In this experiment SPBD latex made by the procedure specified in Example 1 was utilized in the polymerization medium utilized in preparing emulsion SBR. This polymerization was carried out utilizing a 10 gallon (37.9 liter) reactor. The aqueous reaction mixture utilized was prepared by charging 8 lbs. (3.6 kg) of water, 50 lbs. (22.7 kg) of SPBD latex prepared by the procedure described in Example 1, 0.38 lbs. (170 grams) of a tallow fatty acid, 0.38 (170 grams) of a rosin acid, 0.11 lbs. (47.5 grams) of potassium sulfate, 0.04 lbs. (19.2 grams) of sodium naphthalene sulfonate (a dispersing agent), 0.005 lbs. (2.3 grams) of sodium hydrosulfide (an oxygen scavenger), 0.018 lbs. (7.9 grams) of sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate (a reducing agent), 5.63 lbs. (2.54 kg) of styrene, 0.063 lbs. (28.3 grams) of t-dodecylmercaptan (a chain regulator), 0.015 lbs. (6.8 grams) of p-methane hydroperoxide, 13.1 lbs. (5.9 kg) of 1,3-butadiene, and 0.4 grams of a chelated iron salt of tetraethyldiamine tetra-acetic acid which was dissolved in 1.25 lbs. (565 grams) of water. The polymerization was carried out at 50Â° F. (10Â° C.) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The polymerization was shortstopped when a solids content of about 23% was attained. The polymerization was shortstopped by charging a mixture containing 1 lbs. (452 grams) of water, 0.05 lbs. (22.6 grams) of sodium dithiocarbamate, and 0.05 lbs. (22.6 grams) of diethyl hydroxyl amine into the reactor. A stable latex containing SPBD and SBR was obtained utilizing this procedure. The latex was coagulated to produce a highly dispersed blend of SPBD with SBR. This experiment shows that SPBD latex can be utilized in the polymerization medium used in preparing emulsion SBR. This procedure provides a convenient means of preparing highly dispersed blends of SPBD in SBR. EXAMPLE 3 In this experiment a highly dispersed blend of SPBD in nitrile rubber was prepared. This was done by utilizing SPBD latex made by the procedure described in Example 1 as part of the polymerization medium. This polymerization was carried out in a 10 gallon (37.9 liter) laboratory polymerization reactor. The polymerization medium was prepared by charging 22.7 kg of SPBD latex made by the procedure described in Example 1, 3.6 kg of water, 282.5 grams of a tallow fatty acid, 33.9 grams of tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 7.9 grams of sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, 2.8 kg of acrylonitrile, 50.9 grams of t-dodecylmercaptan, 7.9 grams of p-methanehydroperoxide, 5.7 kg of 1,3-butadiene, and 0.4 grams of a chelated iron salt of tetraethylene diamine tetracetic acid which was dissolved in 565 grams of water. The polymerization was carried out at 50Â° F. (10Â° C.) under a nitrogen atmosphere with agitation being applied. When a solids content of about 28% was attained, the polymerization was shortstopped by charging a solution containing 452 grams of water, 22.6 grams of sodium dithiocarbamate, and 22.6 grams of diethylhydroxyl amine into the reactor. A latex containing both SPBD and nitrile rubber was prepared in this experiment. It could be coagulated to obtain a highly dispersed blend of SPBD in nitrile rubber. The latex prepared utilizing this procedure was very stable. This experiment shows that SPBD latex can be utilized as a major component of the polymerization medium in which emulsion nitrile rubber is prepared. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 4 The procedure utilized in Example 1 was repeated in this experiment except that the paraffinic process oil was not utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition. In this experiment the polybutadiene produced did not contain a significant amount of syndiotactic 1,2-microstructure. In fact, the polybutadiene produced was a rubbery polymer. This experiment shows that it is necessary to utilize an oil in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition. If the oil is not utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition, SPBD is not produced in polymerizations which are initiated utilizing the catalyst. While certain representative embodiments and details have been shown for the purpose of illustrating the subject invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in this art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the scope of this invention."

For example, the incorporation of SPBD into rubber compositions which are utilized in the supporting carcass or innerliner of tires greatly improves the green strength of those compositions. Electron beam precure (microwave precure) is a technique which has gained wide commercial acceptance as a means of improving the green strength of synthetic elastomers which are used in building tires. However, electron beam precure techniques are costly. The incorporation of SPBD into blends of such synthetic elastomers can often improve green strength to the degree that electron beam precure is not required. The incorporation of SPBD into halogenated butyl rubbers which are utilized as the innerliner compositions for tires also greatly improves the scorch safety of such compositions. U.S. Patent 4,274,462 disclosed that pneumatic tires having improved resistance against heat build-up can be prepared by utilizing SPBD fibers in their tread base rubber. SPBD can also be molded into a wide variety of useful articles. Techniques for preparing SPBD by solution polymerization and by suspension polymerization are known in the art. A process is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,778,424 for the preparation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene which comprises polymerizing 1,3-butadiene in an organic solvent in the presence of a catalyst composition composed of: ~r (a) a cobalt compound, l 3341 95 (b) an organoaluminum compound of the formula AlR3, in which R is a hydrocarbon radical of 1-6 carbons, and (c) carbon disulfide.U.S. Patent 3,901,868 reveals a process for producing a butadiene polymer consisting essentially of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene by the successive steps of: (a) preparing a catalyst component solution by dissolving, in an inert organic solvent containing 1,3-butadiene, a cobalt compound, soluble in the organic solvent, such as (i) cobalt-~-diketone complex, (ii) cobalt-~-keto acid ester complex, (iii) cobalt salt of organic carboxylic acid, and (iv) halogenated cobalt-ligand compound complex, and an organoaluminum compound, (b) preparing a catalyst composition by mixing the catalyst component solution with an alcohol, ketone or aldehyde compound and carbon disulfide, (c) providing a polymerization mixture containing desired amounts of 1,3-butadiene, the catalyst composition and an inert organic solvent, and (d) polymerizing 1,3-butadiene at a temperature of -20C to 90C. U.S. Patent 4,429,085 discloses a process for producing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene by suspension polymerization in an aqueous medium. In this aqueous polymerization process polybutadiene which has an essentially syndiotactic 1,2-microstructure is made by the steps of: (A) preparing a catalyst component solution by dissolving, in an inert organic solvent containing 1,3-butadiene (a) at least one cobalt compound selected from the group consisting of (i) ~-diketone complexes of cobalt, (ii) ~-keto acid ester complexes of cobalt, (iii) cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids having 6 to 15 carbon atoms, and (iv) complexes of halogenated cobalt compounds of the formula CoXn, wherein Xrepresents a halogen atom and n represents 2 or 3, with an organic compound selected from the group consisting of tertiary amine alcohols, tertiary phosphines, ketones, and N,N-dialkylamides, and (b) at least one organoaluminum compound of the formula AlR3, wherein Rrepresents a hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms; (B) preparing a reaction mixture by mixing said catalyst component solution with a 1,3-butadiene/water mixture containing desired amounts of said 1,3-butadiene; (C) preparing a polymerization mixture by mixing carbon disulfide throughout said reaction mixture, and (D) polymerizing said 1,3-butadiene in said polymerization mixture into polybutadiene while agitating said polymerization mixture. U.S. Patent 4,751,275 discloses a process for the preparation of SPBD by the solution polymerization of 1,3-butadiene in a hydrocarbon polymerization medium, such as benzene, toluene, cyclohexane, or n-hexane.The catalyst system used in this solution polymerization contains a chromium-III compound which is soluble in hydrocarbons, a trialkylaluminum compound, and a dialkylphosphite, such as di-neopentylphosphite or di-butylphosphite. Heretofore, blends of SPBD with rubbery elastomers have been prepared utilizing standard mixing techniques. For instance, SPBD can be mixed throughout a rubbery elastomer utilizing a Banbury mixer or a mill mixer. However, these standard mixing procedures have certain drawbacks. These drawbacks include high processing costs, polymer degradation, inadequate mixing, and process limitations. The processing equipment required in order to mix SPBD throughout rubbery elastomers by mastication is also expensive and very costly to operate. Such standard mixing procedures result in polymer degradation due to the high shearing forces and high temperatures which may be required for mixing. For instance, it is generally desirable to mix the SPBD throughout the rubbery elastomer at a temperature which is above the melting point of the SPBD. Accordingly, SPBD powder, which is utilized in tire innerliner or carcass compounds, is mixed into the compound utilizing standard mixing procedures at a temperature which is at least as high as the melting point of the SPBD being used. Since high mixing temperatures result in degradation of the rubbery elastomer being utilized as the innerliner or carcass compound, the melting point of the SPBDutilized has typically been limited to no more than about 190C. In order to limit polymer degradation, the SPBD utilized in such applications typically has a melting point of no more than about 160C. Even though the green strength of tire carcass compounds containing SPBD increases with the melting temperature of the SPBD, the higher mixing temperature associated with the higher melting SPBD makes its utilization very difficult because of the degradation that occurs utilizing standard mixing techniques. Furthermore, good dispersions of SPBD throughout rubbers are difficult to attain utilizing conventional mixing techniques. ~ _5 Summary of the Invention 1 3 34 1 95 This invention relates to a process for producing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene latex.

The subject invention further discloses a catalyst emulsion composition which is useful in the emulsion polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene, which is prepared by dissolving in an inert organic solvent containing at least one polyene (a) at least one cobalt compound selected from the group consisting of (i) ~-ketone complexes of cobalt, (ii) ~-keto acid ester complexes of cobalt, (iii) cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids having 6 to 15 carbon atoms, and (iv) complexes of halogenated cobalt compounds of the formula CoXn, wherein X represents a halogen atom and n represents 2 or 3, with an organic compound selected from the group consisting of tertiary amine alcohols, tertiary phosphines, ketones and N,N-dialkylamides, and (b) at least one organoaluminum compound of the for~ula AlR3 wherein R represents a hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms to produce a catalyst component solution, and microfluidizing the catalyst component solution with an oil, a surfactant, and water to an average particle size which is within the range of about 10 nanometers to about 1000 nanometers. The latices made by the process of this invention can be utilized in preparing blends of SPBD with rubbery elastomers. This can be done by simply mixing the SPBD latex with the latex of a rubber. For instance, an SPBD/styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) blend can be prepared by simply mixing the SPBD latex with an SBR latex. The SPBD/SBR blend can then be recovered utilizing conventional coagulation techniques. By utilizing this technique, all of the drawbacks associated with conventional blending of dry SPBD with dry rubbers are overcome. Blends of SPBD with various rubbery elastomers can also be prepared by utilizing the SPBD latex as the polymerization medium for preparing other emulsion rubbers. For instance, a blend of SPBD with SBR can be prepared by adding styrene monomer, 1,3-butadiene monomer, emulsifiers, and an appropriate initiator to a SPBD latex. The SBR is accordingly prepared by emulsion polymerization in the SPBD latex. This results in the formation of a latex which contains both SPBD and SBR. The SPBD/SBR blend can be recovered by simply coagulating the latex. The SPBD latices made in accordance with this invention are also valuable for utilization in other applications. For instance, SPBD powders having a very small particle size can be prepared by simply drying 1 334 1 ~5 the SPBD latex. SPBD made utilizing other polymerization techniques must be ground in order to obtain small particle size powders. The SPBD latices of this invention can also be applied to substrates and allowed to dry. This provides the substrate with a thin coating of the SPBD. For instance, rubber slabs can be dipped in SPBD latex to prevent them from sticking together. Detailed Description of the Invention A catalyst emulsion composition is utilized to catalyze the emulsion polymerizations of this invention. A catalyst component solution is utilized in preparing such catalyst emulsion compositions. The catalyst component solution is prepared by dissolving at least one cobalt compound and at least one organoaluminum compound in an inert organic solvent containing at least one polyene monomer which is dissolved therein. The term \"an inert organic solvent\" used herein refers to an organic solvent chemically inert to all of the catalyst components, the emulsifier, the 1,3-butadiene and the SPBD. Some representative examples of inert organic solvents include aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, alicyclic hydrocarbons, halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, and mixtures of two or more of the above-mentioned compounds. Some representative examples of aromatic hydrocarbons that can be utilized include benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, diethylbenzene or isobutylbenzene. The aliphatic hydrocarbons which can be used include n-hexane, isohexanes, n-heptane, n-octane, isooctanes, n-decane, 2,2-dimethylbutane, petroleum ether, kerosene, petroleum spirit or petroleum naphtha. The alicyclic hydrocarbons that can be used include cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane.Some representative examples of halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons that can be used include chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzenes or trichlorobenzenes.The cobalt compound usable for the process of the present invention is soluble in an inert organic solvent selected from the group consisting of (i) ~-diketone compounds; (ii) ~-keto acid ester complexes of cobalt; (iii) cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids having 1 to 25 carbon atoms, and (iv) complexes of halogenated cobalt compounds of the formula CoXn wherein X represents a halogen atom and n represents 2 or 3, with an organic compound selected from the group consisting of tertiary amines, alcohols, tertiary phosphines, ketones and N,N-dialkylamides. The ~-diketone compound which can be used to form a complex with a cobalt atom is of the formula: Rl- C C C R4 1~ l3 ll O R O wherein Rl and R4, which are the same as or different from one another, are an alkyl radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms and R2 and R3, which are the same as or different from one another, are a hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. This type of ~-diketone complex of cobalt may be cobalt (II) acetylacetonate or cobalt (III) acetylacetonate. The ~-keto acid ester which can be used to form a complex with a cobalt atom may be of the formula: R2 1 334 ~ 95 Rl- C- C C- O- R4 Il l3 \"O R O wherein Rl, R2, R3 and R4 are the same as defined above. This type of cobalt complex may be a cobalt-acetoacetic acid ethyl ester complex. Some representative examples of cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids that can be used include 10 cobalt octoate and cobalt naphthanate. In the ligand compounds capable of forming a complex with a halogenated cobalt compound, the tertiary amine may be pyridine, triethylamine, tributylamine or dimethylaniline, the alcohol may be 15 ethyl alcohol methyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, or n-butyl alcohol, the tertiary phosphine may be trimethyl phosphine, tributyl phosphine or triphenyl phosphine, the ketone may be acetone or methyl ethyl ketone and the N,N-dialkylamide 20 may be N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-diethylformamide or N,N-diethylacetamide. The complex of halogenated cobalt is preferably either a complex of cobalt chloride with pyridine or ethyl alcohol. The organoaluminum compound usable for the process of the present invention is of the formula AlR3 wherein R represents a hydrocarbon radical containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The hydrocarbon radical may be an alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl radical containing from about 30 1 to about 6 carbon atoms. Preferably, the organoaluminum compound will be trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum triisobutylaluminum or triphenylaluminum. In the preparation of the catalyst component solution, it is important that the cobalt compound and the organoaluminum compound are dissolved in the inert organic solvent containing at least one polyene. Some polyenes that can be used in the formation of the polyene products used to prepare microencapsulated catalysts are 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, isoprene, myrcene and 1,5-cyclooctadiene. Polyenes in which at least two of the double bonds are conjugated and which have minimal substitution on the double bonds are preferred, particularly l,3-butadiene. Other olefins which can be used are those which are capable of serving as chelating agents for transition metals, such as 1,5-cyclooctadiene. Polyenes with neither conjugation nor good chelating potential are much less effective. If the preparation is carried out in the absence of a polyene, the resultant catalyst component solution is not effective as a component of the catalyst composition of the present invention. The polyene is preferably used in a ratio by mole of at least 1.0, more preferably, at least 5.0 to the amount by mole of the cobalt compound to be used in the catalyst component solution. The preferred polyenes for use in this invention are 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, isoprene, and myrcene. The most preferred polyene is 1,3-butadiene. Generally, the larger the ratio of the amount of polyene to the cobalt compound in the catalyst component solution, the higher the activity of the catalyst. However, the activity of the catalyst reaches a maximum value at a ratio by mole of polyene monomer to the cobalt compound used in the catalyst component solution of between 10 and 200. For example, if a molar ratio of polyene monomer to the cobalt -12- l 334 1 95 compound of 10,000 is employed, the activity of the catalyst will be similar to that of the catalyst prepared from a catalyst component solution containing a ratio of polyene monomer to the cobalt compound of from 10 to 200. If the ratio is less than 1.0, the resultant catalyst composition has poor activity. The catalyst component solution is preferably prepared at a temperature of -10C to 50C and preferably contains 0.0005 to 1.0% by mole, more preferably 0.001 to 0.5~ by mole, of the cobalt compound. The temperature at which the catalyst component solution is prepared will more preferably be within the range of 5C to 25C and it is also highly desirable to use vigorous agitation in the preparation of the catalyst component solution. Generally, from about 0.001 to 10 mole percent, more preferably from about 0.03 to about 5 mole percent of the organoaluminum compounds is utilized, based on the amount of 1,3-butadiene to be polymerized. The ratio by mole of the organoaluminum compound to the cobalt compound is preferably in a range from 0.2 to 50, more preferably, within the range of from 0.5 to 10. In the preparation of the catalyst component solution, it is preferred for the cobalt compound to be first dissolved in the inert organic solvent in the presence of the polyene monomer and then for the organoaluminum compound to be added to the solution.However, very satisfactory results can also be obtained when the organoaluminum compound is added first. In the preparation of this catalyst component solution, the organoaluminum compound should not be allowed to come in contact with water. This is because water can completely decompose such organoaluminum compounds. Accordingly, it is preferable that the inert organic solvent to be used to prepare the catalyst component solution be preliminarily dehydrated at least up to a content of water which is insufficient to completely decompose the entire amount of the organoaluminum compound.It is preferable that the catalyst component solution be prepared using a dry (essentially water free) inert organic solvent. However, a trace of water in the inert organic solvent can be present up to a concentration of about 500 ppm (parts per million by weight). In fact, it is believed that the total elimination of water from such a catalyst component solution is undesirable. It is preferred for no more than 200 ppm of water to be present in the inert organic solvent used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution. If the content of water in the inert organic solvent is larger than 500 ppm, the catalyst component solution has to contain a relatively large amount of the cobalt compound and organoaluminum compound. This results in an economic disadvantage.If a sufficient amount of water is present in the inert organic solvent used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution, the catalyst can be completely destroyed. The catalyst component solution will preferably be stored under an inert gas atmosphere, such as nitrogen, in the absence of sunlight or ultraviolet light. It is desirable to allow the prereaction used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution to run for a period of at least 30 seconds, and more preferably for at least 1 minute before mixing the catalyst component solution with the oil, surfactant, and water used in making the catalyst emulsion composition. Longer time periods can be used without the catalyst component solution losing its activity. After the organoaluminum compound has been incorporated in the catalyst component solution using the above-described technique, the catalyst is \"protected\" from decomposition by water. This is believed to be due to a microencapsulation of the catalyst by polyene product formed in the prereaction process used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution. It is believed that a hydrophobic shield is formed around the catalyst that water cannot readily penetrate; however, this hydrophobic shield or membrane is probably permeable by the butadiene monomer being polymerized into the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene.When 1,3-butadiene is used as the polyene, the butadiene product which microencapsulates the catalyst is believed to be a butadiene monomer complex, an oligomerized butadiene or a polymer of butadiene. It has been determined that this protection is sufficient to allow for the use of this catalyst component solution in the aqueous emulsion polymerization of butadiene into SPBD. The catalyst emulsion composition is prepared by microfluidizing or microemulsifying the catalyst component solution with an oil, a surfactant and water.In preparing the catalyst emulsion composition, it is highly desirable to first mix the catalyst component solution with the oil and to separately mix the surfactant with the water. The catalyst component solution/oil mixture is then subsequently mixed with the surfactant/water mixture immediately prior to the microfluidization. The ratio of oil to catalyst component solution will normally be within the range of about 0.5 to 30. It is normally preferred for the ratio of oil to catalyst component solution to be within the range of about 1 to about 10 and it is typically most preferred for the oil to catalyst component solution ratio to be within the range of about 2 to about 3. For example, a weight ratio of oil to catalyst component solution of about 2.5:1 is highly preferred. The weight ratio of water to catalyst component solution utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition is typically within the range of about 5 to about 80. It is normally preferred for the weight ratio of water to catalyst component solution to be within the range of about 10 to about 50. In most cases it will be more preferred for the weight ratio of water to catalyst component solution utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition to be within the range of about 20 to about 30. For instance, a weight ratio of water to catalyst component solution of about 27:1 is highly preferred for utilization in preparing the catalyst emulsion compositions of this invention. The weight ratio of surfactant to catalyst component solution utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition will typically be within the range of about 0.001 to about 10. In most cases it will be preferred to utilize a weight ratio of surfactant to catalyst component solution which is within the range of about 0.05 to 5.It is typically more preferred to utilize a ratio of surfactant to catalyst component solution which is within the range of about 0.1 to 0.3. Accordingly, a weight ratio of surfactant to catalyst component solution of about 0.2:1 is highly preferred. The oil utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition will typically be a long chain paraffinic oil. Such oils will generally be mixtures of various long chain hydrocarbons which contain from about 12 to 1 ~34 1 95 about 28 carbon atoms. It is generally preferred for these compounds to be saturated. The oil will preferably be comprised of hydrocarbon compounds which contain from about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms. It is possible to utilize long chain alcohols which contain from about 12 to about 28 carbon atoms as the oil. The utilization of such alcohols results in the SPBD being synthesized having a lower melting point. It is, accordingly, desirable to use such alcohols as the oil if SPBD having a low melting point is desired. On the other hand, if SPBD having a high melting point is sought, then it will not be desirable to utilize alcohols as the oil. It is, of course, also possible to utilize a combination of paraffinic oils and alcohols to adjust the melting point of the SPBD as desired. The surfactant utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition will normally be an anionic surfactant or a nonionic surfactant. Some representative examples of types of anionic surfactants which can be utilized include carboxylates, alkylbenzene sulfonates, alkane sulfonates, ~-olefin sulfonates, fatty alcohol sulfates, and oxo-alcohol sulfates. Some representative examples of types of nonionic surfactants which can be utilized include alkylphenol ethoxylates, fatty-alcohol polyethyleneglycol ethers, oxo-alcohol polyethyleneglycol ethers, ethylene oxide polymers, propylene oxide polymers, and fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers. It is generally preferred for the surfactant to be an anionic surfactant with alkyl benzene sulfonates, fatty alcohol sulfates, and oxo-alcohol ether sulfates being most preferred. The alkyl benzene sulfonates which are utilized generally have the structural formula: R ~ SO3Na l 5 wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 8 to 18 carbon atoms and preferably wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 10 to 13 carbon atoms.The fatty alcohol sulfates which can be utilized normally have the structural formula: R -O- SO3Na wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 6 to 28 carbon atoms and preferably wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 11 to 17 carbon atoms.The oxo-alcohol ether sulfates which can be utilized generally have the structural formula: R CH CH2 -~CH2 CH2 O~ nS3Na wherein n is an integer from 1 to about 4 and wherein Rand R' represent alkyl groups which can be the same or different with the total number of carbon atoms in Rand R' ranging from about 11 to about 13. The microfluidization procedure utilized results in the formation of a catalyst emulsion composition which has an average particle size which is within the range of about 10 to about 1,000 nanometers. The catalyst emulsion composition prepared will preferably have an average particle size which is within the range of about 30 to about 600 nanometers and will more - preferably have an average particle size which is within the range of about 60 to about 300 nanometers.This microfluidization procedure can be carried out utilizing conventional microfluidizers or other equipment which is capable of homogenizing the catalyst emulsion composition to the desired particle size. For instance, the microfluidization can be carried out utilizing a high pressure pump or series of pumps.Ultrasonic and/or mechanical means can be utilized in the microfluidization procedure. To attain the desired particle size, it may be advantageous to pass the catalyst emulsion composition which is being prepared through the Microfluidizer~ more than one time. The catalyst component solution utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition is stable over long periods of time and can be stored for long periods without losing its activity. However, it is highly desirable to utilize the catalyst emulsion composition as soon as possible after it is prepared because the catalyst emulsion composition loses its activity over time. In practice, the catalyst emulsion composition loses essentially all of its activity after about 24 hours of being stored at room temperature. It is, accordingly, important to use the catalyst emulsion composition as soon as possible after its preparation. The aqueous reaction mixture is prepared by mixing (1) water, (2) at least one emulsifier, (3) 1,3-butadiene monomer, (4) the catalyst emulsion composition and (5) carbon disulfide and/or phenylthiocyanate. Water is the major component in the aqueous reaction mixture. The amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer in the aqueous reaction mixture will vary from about 2 weight percent to about 50 weight percent.However, in most cases it will be preferred for the aqueous reaction mixture to contain from about 10 weight percent to about 40 weight percent 1,3-butadiene monomer. It will generally be more preferred for the -19- i334195 aqueous reaction mixture to contain from about 20 to about 30 weight percent 1,3-butadiene monomer. The amount of emulsifier utilized in preparing the aqueous reaction mixture will normally be within the range of about 0.1 phm to about 10 phm (parts per hundred parts of monomer). It will normally be preferred for the emulsifier to be present in an amount ranging from about 0.5 phm to about 5 phm. In most cases, it will be more preferred for the emulsifier to be present in an amount within the range of about 1 phm to about 3 phm. The emulsifiers used in the emulsion polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into SPBD may be charged at the outset of the polymerization or may be added incrementally or by proportioning as the reaction proceeds. Generally, anionic emulsifier systems provide good results, however, any of the general types of anionic, cationic or nonionic emulsifiers may be employed in the polymerization. Among the anionic emulsifiers that can be employed in such emulsion polymerizations are fatty acids and their alkali metal soaps such as caprylic acid, capric acid, pelargonic acid, lauric acid, undecyclic acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, and the like; amine soaps of fatty acids such as those formed from ammonia, mono-and dialkyl amines, substituted hydrazines, guanidine and various low molecular weight diamines;chain-substituted derivatives of fatty acids such as those having alkyl substituents; naphthenic acids and their soaps and the like; sulfuric esters and their salts, such as the tallow alcohol sulfates, coconut alcohol sulfates, fatty alcohol sulfates, such as oleyl sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate and the like; sterol -sulfates; sulfates of alkylcyclohexanols, sulfation products of lower polymers of ethylene as C10 to C20 straight chain olefins, and other hydrocarbon mixtures, sulfuric esters of aliphatic and aromatic alcohols having intermediate linkages, such as ether, ester, or amide groups such as alkylbenzyl (polyethyleneoxy) alcohols, the sodium salt of tridecyl ether sulfate;alkane sulfonates, esters and salts, such as alkylchlorosulfonates with the general formula RSO2Cl, wherein R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and alkylsulfonates with the general formula RSO2-OH, wherein R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms; sulfonates with intermediate linkages such as ester and ester-linked sulfonates such as those having the formula RCOOC2H4SO3H and ROOC-CH2-SO3H, wherein R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms such as dialkyl sulfosuccinates; ester salts with the general formula: O S03Na wherein R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms; alkylaryl sulfonates in which the alkyl groups contain preferably from 10 to 20 carbon atoms, e.g.dodecylbenzenesulfonates, such as sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate; alkyl phenol sulfonates; sulfonic acids and their salts such as acids with the formula RSO3Na, wherein R is an alkyl and the like; sulfonamides;sulfamido methylenesulfonic acids; rosin acids and their soaps; sulfonated derivatives of rosin and rosin oil; and lignin sulfonates, and the like. Carboxylate emulsifiers are highly preferred. This is because their utilization leads to less build-up on the walls of the polymerization reactor. Fatty acid soaps and rosin acid soaps are representative examples of highly preferred carboxylate soaps. Of rosin acids, about 90 percent are isometric with abietic acid and the other 10 percent is a mixture of dehydro abietic acid and dihydro abietic acid. Agitation should be provided in the preparation of the aqueous reaction mixture to ensure that the catalyst emulsion composition, the monomer, and the surfactant are distributed essentially homogeneously throughout the mixture. Since 1,3-butadiene monomer is very volatile, it will be necessary to prepare the aqueous reaction mixture under pressure in a closed system. The carbon disulfide or phenyl isothiocyanate is typically the last component to be added to the aqueous reaction mixture. The addition of carbon disulfide and/or phenyl isothiocyanate to the reaction mixture which already contains the catalyst emulsion composition will initiate the polymerization reaction.The amount of carbon disulfide or phenyl isothiocyanate that can be added will vary between 0.005 phm and 2 phm. More preferably, the amount of carbon disulfide added will vary between 0.001 and 1 phm. In the process of the present invention, the larger the proportion of the carbon disulfide in a range from about 0.0005 phm to about 0.5 phm in the polymerization mixture, the larger the yield of the SPBD obtained from the polymerization mixture. However, too large an amount of carbon disulfide, for example, larger than about 0.5 phm, causes a decrease in the polymer yield. ~- -22-In the process of the present invention, the crystallinity and melting point of the polybutadiene produced can be controlled by adding alcohols, ketones, nitriles, aldehydes, or amides to the aqueous reaction mixture. In this aqueous emulsion polymerization process, there is a limitation of controlling crystallinity and melting point with agents which are water-soluble. Thus, ethanol and methanol are not as effective as other alcohols which are much less soluble in water than in hydrocarbons.Water soluble agents cannot be used as effectively to control crystallinity and melting point (only hydrocarbon soluble agents can be used). A detailed description of the agents and techniques that are used to control crystallinity and melting points is given in United States Patents 3,901,868 and 4,153,767. As has been pointed out, water soluble agents, such as ethanol and methanol, are not effective agents. Other alcohols such as, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 1-decanol, and 5-tridecanol, which are not soluble in water, can be used with better success. The 1,3-butadiene monomer is polymerized into SPBD while agitating the polymerization mixture. If the use of an antioxidant is desired, it may be added conveniently at the beginning of the polymerization.This polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer can be carried out at a temperature from about -20C to about 100C. It is preferable for the polymerization temperature to be from 0C to 60 C. The most preferred polymerization temperature is about 10C to about 30 C. At temperatures below 0 C, an antifreeze agent can be added to the polymerization mixture to keep it from freezing. This polymerization can be carried out either under a normal pressure or in a pressurized system. This polymerization can be carried out under an inert gas atmosphere, such as a nitrogen atmosphere, with good results. Such a polymerization can be run for a period of from about 3 to about 30 hours. It is generally preferred for the polymerization to be run for a period which is within the range of about 10 to 16 hours.However, the optimum polymerization time will vary greatly with the polymerization temperature, catalyst, the amount of catalyst used, etc. In most cases, the optimum polymerization time will be within the range of about 12 to about 14 hours.- After the polymerization has been completed, the SPBD can be recovered from the latex by standard coagulation techniques. In the alternative, the SPBDlatex can be blended with the latices of rubbery elastomers as desired or it can be utilized as the polymerization medium for preparing emulsion rubbers.In any case, the SPBD can be coagulated from the latex by utilizing standard techniques. For instance, coagulation can be accomplished by adding acids or blends of salts with acids to the latex. For example, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, blends of sodium chloride with sulfuric acid and blends of hydrochloric acid with methanol are very effective as coagulating agents. Calcium chloride solutions and blends of calcium chloride with various acids can also be utilized as coagulants. Salt/acid coagulants are generally preferred. For instance, the utilization of sulfuric acid with sodium chloride or potassium chloride as the coagulant will lead to good results.Barium chloride and magnesium sulfate are additional examples of divalent salts which are suitable for -24- l 3341 95 utilization in coagulating the SPBD latex. It may also be advantageous to employ materials classified as coagulation aids, such as high molecular weight polyelectrolytes, in the coagulation of the SPBD latex.The preferred coagulation aids are weak bases. Some representative examples of suitable coagulation aids which can be used include Nalco~ 108 (Nalco Chemical Company), Daxad~ CP-l (W. R. Grace and Company), and similar materials that are also weakly basic polyelectrolytes. The quantity of coagulant required will vary with the emulsifier, the amount of emulsifier used, the rubber being coagulated, and the type of coagulant being employed. Generally, the optimum type of coagulant, quantity of coagulant and coagulating conditions can be determined using a trial and error approach. If a blend of the SPBD with a rubbery elastomer is sought, then the SPBD latex is mixed with a latex of the rubbery elastomer prior to coagulation. The coagulation of such blended latices results in the formation of a highly dispersed blend of SPBDthroughout the rubbery elastomer. The amount of SPBDand rubber in the blend is determined by the amount of the various latices which are mixed together. It is, of course, important for the latices to be compatible with each other to prevent undesired reactions from taking place. Blends of SPBD with a wide variety of rubbery elastomers including high cis-1,4-polybutadiene, synthetic polyisoprene, SBR, isoprene-butadiene rubber, nitrile rubber, butyl rubbers, halogenated butyl rubbers, ethylene propylene diene monomer rubbers (EPDM), and ethylene propylene rubbers (EPR) can be made utilizing this technique. In cases where the SPBD latex is utilized as the polymerization medium for producing emulsion rubbers typically additional water, emulsifiers initiator, and desired monomers will be added thereto. It is, of course, important to select an emulsifier, initiator, and monomers which are compatible with the SPBD latex.The monomers present in the polymerization medium are then polymerized into the rubbery elastomer desired.For instance, this can be done utilizing free radical polymerization techniques. Such polymerizations can be initiated utilizing standard chemical free radical initiators, ultraviolet light, or radiation. To ensure a satisfactory polymerization rate, uniformity, and a controllable polymerization, free radical initiators are generally used with good results. Free radical initiators which are commonly used include the various peroxygen compounds such as potassium persulfate, ammonium persulfate, benzoyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, di-t-butyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl peroxide, decanoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, p-menthane hydroperoxide, t-butylhydroperoxide, acetyl acetone peroxide, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, succinic acid peroxide, dicetyl peroxydicarbonate, t-butyl peroxyacetate, t-butyl peroxymaleic acid, t-butyl peroxybenzoate, acetyl cyclohexyl sulfonyl peroxide and the like; the various azo compounds such as 2-t-butylazo-2-cyanopropane, dimethyl azodiisobutyrate, azodiisobutyronitrile, 2-t-butylazo-1-cyanocyclohexane, l-t-amylazo-l-cyanocyclohexane, and the like; the various alkyl perketals, such as 2,2-bis-(t-butylperoxy)butane, ethyl 3,3-bis(t-butylperoxy) butyrate, l,l-di-(t-butylperoxy) cyclohexane, and the like. Cumene hydroperoxide can be used as an initiator to obtain very good results in the polymerization of carboxylated nitrile rubber. The emulsion polymerization system used in the synthesis of carboxylated rubbers can be treated at the desired degree of conversion with shortstopping agents, such as hydroquinone. The latex made can then be coagulated using a standard technique. This results in the formation of a highly dispersed blend of the SPBD throughout the rubbery elastomer. In an alternative embodiment of this invention, SPBD latex can be prepared in the latex of a rubbery elastomer. Such polymerizations are carried out by adding 1,3-butadiene monomer, the catalyst emulsion composition, carbon disulfide and/or phenyl isothiocyanate, and additional emulsifiers if desired to the latex of the rubbery elastomer. A latex containing the SPBD as well as the rubbery elastomer will result. This latex can accordingly be coagulated to form a highly dispersed blend of the SPBD throughout the rubbery elastomer. This invention is illustrated by the following examples which are merely for the purpose of illustration and are not to be regarded as limiting the scope of the invention or the manner in which it can be practiced. Unless specifically indicated otherwise, parts and percentages are given by weight. Particle sizes reported herein were determined utilizing a Nicomp Model 370 dynamic light scattering unit using automatic sample preparation techniques. Example 1 In this experiment a latex of SPBD was prepared.The first step of the procedure utilized involved making the catalyst component solution. This was done by charging 7.3 lbs. (3.3 kg) of hexane to a reactor which had been evacuated for 30 minutes. Then 0.61 lbs. (0.28 kg) of cobalt octoate was added with the mixture being agitated. Then 1.3 lbs. (0.59 kg) of 1,3-butadiene was added. After that 3.5 lbs. (1.59 kg) of triethylaluminum was added with the agitation being continued. Cooling was also utilized to keep the temperature of the mixture below about 70F (21C).After all of the triethylaluminum had been added and the temperature fell below 50F (10C). The catalyst component solution which had been prepared was transferred to a clean plastic 5 gallon (18.9 liter) carboy for storage in a cold room until needed. The catalyst component solution was additionally stored under a blanket of nitrogen in the absence of light. A mixture of the catalyst component solution with a paraffinic oil was then prepared. This was done by mixing 450 grams of the catalyst component solution with 300 grams of a paraffinic process oil. Asurfactant solution was also prepared. This was done by mixing 7 lbs. (3.2 kg) of water with 300 grams of an aqueous solution containing 28% sodium lauryl sulfate.The mixture of the oil with the catalyst component solution was then microfluidized with the surfactant solution. This was done in a homogenizer unit made by Microfluidics Corporation. Mixing of the aqueous and organic phases was accomplished utilizing a mixing Tee just ahead of the Microfluidizer~ pump. The homogenization process was continued until an average particle size for the catalyst emulsion composition of about 100 nanometers was attained. The catalyst emulsion composition prepared was determined to contain particles which varied in size from about 60 to about 300 nanometers. `~ ~ -28- l 334 1 q5 A buffer solution having a pH of about 9.5 was prepared by mixing 20 lbs. (9.1 kg) of water with 1.8 lbs. (0.82 kg) of a tallow fatty acid. The buffer solution was added to a polymerization reactor and 12.5 lbs. (5.7 kg) of 1,3-butadiene monomer was charged into the reactor. The reactor was equipped with two afts with baffles for agitation which was carried out at 150 rpm. The catalyst emulsion composition prepared was charged into the reactor along with 9 grams of carbon disulfide which was dissolved in 391 grams of hexane.The polymerization was carried out at a temperature of about 50F (10C) for a period of 12 to 14 hours. Astable SPBD latex having a solids content of above 20%was produced. Example 2 In this experiment SPBD latex made by the procedure specified in Example 1 was utilized in the polymerization medium utilized in preparing emulsion SBR. This polymerization was carried out utilizing a 10 gallon (37.9 liter) reactor. The aqueous reaction mixture utilized was prepared by charging 8 lbs. (3.6 kg) of water, 50 lbs. (22.7 kg) of SPBD latex prepared by the procedure described in Example 1, 0.38 lbs. (170 grams) of a tallow fatty acid, 0.38 (170 grams) of a rosin acid, 0.11 lbs. (47.5 grams) of potassium sulfate, 0.04 lbs. (19.2 grams) of sodium naphthalene sulfonate (a dispersing agent), 0.005 lbs. (2.3 grams) of sodium hydrosulfide (an oxygen scavenger), 0.018 lbs. (7.9 grams) of sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate (a reducing agent), 5.63 lbs. (2.54 kg) of styrene, 0.063 lbs. (28.3 grams) of t-dodecylmercaptan (a chain regulator), 0.015 lbs. (6.8 grams) of p-methane hydroperoxide, 13.1 lbs. (5.9 kg) of 1,3-butadiene, and -29- 1 334 1 q5 0.4 grams of a chelated iron salt of tetraethyldiamine tetra-acetic acid which was dissolved in 1.25 lbs. (565 grams) of water. The polymerization was carried out at 50F (10C) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The polymerization was shortstopped when a solids content of about 23% was attained. The polymerization was shortstopped by charging a mixture containing 1 lbs.(452 grams) of water, 0.05 lbs. (22.6 grams) of sodium dithiocarbamate, and 0.05 lbs. (22.6 grams) of diethyl hydroxyl amine into the reactor. A stable latex containing SPBD and SBR was obtained utilizing this procedure. The latex was coagulated to produce a highly dispersed blend of SPBD with SBR.This experiment shows that SPBD latex can be utilized in the polymerization medium used in preparing emulsion SBR. This procedure provides a convenient means of preparing highly dispersed blends of SPBD in SBR. Example 3 In this experiment a highly dispersed blend of SPBDin nitrile rubber was prepared. This was done by utilizing SPBD latex made by the procedure described in Example 1 as part of the polymerization medium. This polymerization was carried out in a 10 gallon (37.9 liter) laboratory polymerization reactor. The polymerization medium was prepared by charging 22.7 kg of SPBD latex made by the procedure described in Example 1, 3.6 kg of water, 282.5 grams of a tallow fatty acid, 33.9 grams of tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 7.9 grams of sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, 2.8 kg of acrylonitrile, 50.9 grams of t-dodecylmercaptan, 7.9 grams of p-methanehydroperoxide, 5.7 kg of 1,3-butadiene, and 0.4 grams of a chelated iron salt of tetraethylene diamine tetracetic acid which was dissolved in 565 grams of water. The polymerization was carried out at 50F (10C) under a nitrogen atmosphere with agitation being applied. When a solids content of about 28% was attained, the polymerization was shortstopped by charging a solution containing 452 grams of water, 22.6 grams of sodium dithiocarbamate, and 22.6 grams of diethylhydroxyl amine into the reactor. A latex containing both SPBD and nitrile rubber was prepared in this experiment. It could be coagulated to obtain a highly dispersed blend of SPBD in nitrile rubber. The latex prepared utilizing this procedure was very stable. This experiment shows that SPBD latex can be utilized as a major component of the polymerization medium in which emulsion nitrile rubber is prepared.Comparative Example 4 The procedure utilized in Example 1 was repeated in this experiment except that the paraffinic process oil was not utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition. In this experiment the polybutadiene produced did not contain a significant amount of syndiotactic 1,2-microstructure. In fact, the polybutadiene produced was a rubbery polymer. This experiment shows that it is necessary to utilize an oil in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition. If the oil is not utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition, SPBD is not produced in polymerizations which are initiated utilizing the catalyst. While certain representative embodiments and details have been shown for the purpose of illustrating the subject invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in this art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the scope of this invention."

        "text": "Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to foams prepared from compositions comprising polypropylene (hereinafter referred to as \"PP\") resin and having remarkably improved extrusion foaming characteristics and to a process for producing the same, and more particularly to foams of PP resin composition prepared by kneading at a high temperature and high pressure a composition comprising PP resin, 1,2-polybutadiene (hereinafter referred to as \"1,2-PB\") resin and a blowing agent, thereafter cooling the composition and extruding the cooled composition into a low pressure zone, the extruded foams being characterized in that when dissolved in hot xylene, the foams have an insoluble content of at least 2% by weight based on the whole composition and a soluble 1,2-PB resin content of up to 30% by weight based on the whole composition. The invention further relates to a process for producing same foams. 2. Description of the Prior Art Processes are known for producing extruded foams from polyolefins or like thermoplastic resins by melting and kneading a composition of such resin and a blowing agent at a high temperature and high pressure as by an extruder, cooling the composition to a temperature suitable for foaming and extruding the composition into a low pressure zone for foaming. Japanese Patent Publication No. 4341/1960, for example, discloses a process for preparing extruded foams from a polyolefin resin with use of sym-dichlorotetrafluoroethane as a blowing agent. More particularly said patent publication teaches a process for producing a cellular PP foam by heating highly crystalline PP resin and sym-dichlorotetrafluoroethane in a pressure-resistant steel tube container at a temperature of 175Â° C. for 8 hours, and thereafter extruding the resulting mixture into the atmosphere in an exploding fashion with high pressure nitrogen gas introduced into the tube. Japanese Patent Publication No. 41474/1971 discloses a process for producing foams composed of polyhedral closed cells not smaller than 500Î¼ and having a density of up to 0.03 g/cm3 from a composition comprising PP resin or like crystalline organic linear polymer and a large quantity of activating liquid by flash extrusion foaming. While these conventional processes afford foams of PP resin, the extrusion foaming operation of the former process involves low formability, produces cells of uneven structure and gives surface irregularities and poor appearance to the resulting foam, thus yielding products of reduced commercial value. With the latter process, the foams obtained are limited to the shape of filaments or a thin sheet, and the use of a large amount of activating liquid as a blowing agent inevitably gives foams expanded to an exceedingly high degree of 60 to 100 times. Thus the process involves extreme difficulties in producing under controlled conditions foams expanded to a foaming degree of 10 to 50 times and having a high degree of usefulness. Stated more specifically, the conventional techniques for extruding and foaming highly crystalline PP resin are greatly limited in the range of temperatures for maintaining the resin at a viscoelastic strength suitable for foaming, so that it is almost impossible to maintain the resin at a properly controlled foaming temperature. Great difficulties have therefore been experienced in stably producing foams under controlled conditions having a foaming degree of 10 to 50 times with a neat appearance and uniform cellular structure. Accordingly, it has been proposed to blend some other polymer with PP resin or to use a special PP resin as an improvement in the non-cross-linking extrusion process. Japanese Patent Publication No. 49825/1972, for example, discloses a process for efficiently preparing a foam having uniform minute cells from a mixture of polyethylene, PP resin or like polyolefin and 0.3 to 40 parts by weight of poly-cis-butadiene rubber admixed therewith. Japanese Patent Publication No. 4945/1973 further states that a highly foamed product having uniform minute cells can be prepared from a mixture of a chemical blowing agent and a special PP component containing at least 15% of n-heptane-soluble PP (which appears to be predominantly atactic) and having an intrinsic viscosity (Î·) of 3.0 to 10.0 by foaming the mixture with an extruder operating under a back pressure of at least 200 kg/cm2 in the extruder and a temperature up to 200Â° C. (resin temperature at the die outlet). With respect to these processes, however, Japanese Patent Publication No. 49825/1972, which includes an example wherein low-density polyethylene, amenable to a homogeneous high-degree foaming technique, is used, emphasizes the effect of foaming nuclei as achieved by the use of a very small amount of polybutadiene, and mentions the use of a small amount of water which leads to greatly stabilized foaming. Thus, the prior art, which contemplates formation of minute cells with stability, is entirely distinct from the present invention in object and concept. Additionally, poly-cis-butadiene having poor thermal stability, when admixed with PP resin, gives reduced thermal stability at a high temperature of 80Â° to 130Â° C., thus totally offsetting the important feature of the foamed PP resin--its high resistance to heat. The special PP resin ingredient used in the technique disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 4945/1973 contains at least 15% of n-heptane soluble resin and is therefore invariably lower than usual PP resin in crystallinity and melting point. Consequently, the PP resin ingredient has considerably lower heat resistance and mechanical strength, affording foams having reduced heat resistance and mechanical strength. In recent years there is a growing commercial demand for foams which have higher resistance to heat and lower water absorbing properties than known polyethylene or polystyrene foams and which also possess heat insulating and shock absorbing effects. Accordingly, various techniques have been developed in the art for producing highly foamed products by the non-crosslinking extrusion of high density polyethylene, polypropylene and like resins having higher crystallinity and greater heat resistance than other polyolefin resins. These techniques nevertheless still remain to be improved and have not found wide application. In view of the present situation described above, we have: (a) conducted intensive research on techniques for producing foams having a high foaming degree of 10 to 50 times from PP resin which has especially high resistance to heat among highly crystalline polyolefins resins; and (b) developed foams, as well as a process for producing the same, which have outstanding heat resistance, a uniform cellular structure, attractive appearance and high foaming degree by overcoming the foregoing drawback of PP resin that it has a narrow range of proper extrusion foaming temperatures, without necessitating the complex steps needed for the conventional cross-linking process. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION More specifically stated, the present invention provides foams prepared from a composition comprising highly crystalline PP resin and 1,2-PB resin admixed therewith and made commercially available as a novel thermoplastic resin since 1974, the foams being characterized in that they contain at least 2% by weight of hot xylene insoluble thermal reaction product based on the whole composition, and the admixed 1,2-PB resin affording a hot xylene soluble content of up to 30% by weight based on the whole composition. The invention also provides a novel process for producing the foams characterized in that the PP resin and the 1,2-PB resin are kneaded together under high pressure and at such an elevated temperature that the admixed 1,2-PB resin, when partly or wholly subjected to thermal reaction, gives a hot xylene insoluble content of at least 2% by weight based on the whole composition, the admixed 1,2-PB resin further affording a soluble content of up to 30% by weight based on the whole composition. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS This invention will be more clearly understood by reference to the accompanying drawings in which: FIGS. 1 and 2 are graphs showing kneading torque-time curves obtained with use of a Brabender device; and FIG. 3 shows the flow curves of pressed specimens of the foams prepared in Example 1 and Comparison Example 1. DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS At first, we attempted to foam PP resin singly by an extrusion process corresponding to the technique disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 4341/1960. To be sure, the process gave a foamed product but involved a very narrow range of proper extrusion foaming temperatures, while the foam was found to be of no commercial value because it had an irregular surface and a markedly uneven cellular structure including unfoamed cores and voids extending into the interior of the foam. These difficulties encountered in the extrusion foaming of PP resin are very characteristic of this resin unlike other resins, such as polystyrene and low-density polyethylene, from which an appreciably uniform cellular structure can be obtained without resorting to a special extrusion process. The above difficulties appear attributable to the extremely limited range of temperatures at which PP resin retains viscoelastic strength suitable for foaming said resins by the non-cross-linking process. At temperatures not lower than the melting point, PP resin has a reduced melt viscosity, permitting the blowing gas pressure to break cell forming walls without foaming, whereas at temperatures lower than the melting point, crystallization starts to take place, causing the blowing agent to separate from the molten resin and producing a marked increase in viscoelastic strength to prevent foaming. Thus, the high crystallinity of PP resin causes a great change in its viscoelasticity in the vicinity of the melting point and leads to difficulties. Accordingly, we conducted experiments with use of PP resin in admixture with various thermoplastic resins in order to overcome the foregoing difficulties inherent in the extrusion foaming of PP resin. Close investigations were made on more than ten kinds of thermoplastic resins including low density polyethylene, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, ethylene-propylene copolymer, ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer, crystalline isotactic polybutene-1, polyisobutylene, isoprene-isobutylene rubber, cis-1,4-polybutadiene rubber, low-molecular-weight polyethylene, poly-4-methylpentene-1, thermoplastic polyester elastomer, 1,2-PB resin, and the like. As a result, we have found that to foam PP resin without encountering difficulty because or the narrow range of proper foaming temperature, uneven cellular structure of the foam, surface irregularities in the foam product, and the like it is necessary to use the PP resin in admixture with 1,2-PB resin. Thus the use of 1,2-PB resin as kneaded with PP resin under specified conditions renders PP resin extrudable over a wider range of proper foaming temperatures, produces a uniform cellular structure and results in diminished surface irregularities, giving remarkably improved extrudability to the PP resin and permitting efficient production of foams with a high degree of foaming. The reason why such effects are achievable according to this invention remains to be fully clarified. However, it is believed that, when PP resin and 1,2-PB resin are kneaded together as by an extruder at a high temperature and high pressure, chemically active side-chain vinyl groups of the 1,2-PB resin locally undergo, under the influence of the heat and shear force, a complex reaction including intermolecular cross-linking and/or intramolecular cyclization. Since the PP and 1,2-PB resins are being kneaded at this time, the reaction product becomes intimately entangled with molecular chains of the PP resin. Presumably this effect of entanglement reduces the marked change of viscoelasticity attendant on the foaming of PP resin. It appears that the reaction product of the 1,2-PB resin accounts for nearly the entire portion of the hot xylene insoluble content referred to in this invention. Nevertheless, we do not wish to be bound by this hypothesis. As will be shown in Comparison Example 2, given later, the 1,2-PB resin, if unreacted, merely produces the same result as will be achieved by the addition of a polymer different from, and having a lower melt viscosity than, the PP resin, thus totally failing to attain the effect of mitigating the marked change of the viscoelasticity in the vicinity of the melting point of the PP resin. It is therefore impossible to give improved extrudability to the PP resin and to obtain highly foamed products with stability as contemplated, merely by subjecting a mixture of PP resin and 1,2-PB resin to extrusion foaming. To fulfill this object, it is critical that the mixture be melted and kneaded at an elevated temperature such that the 1,2-PB resin, when partly or wholly subjected to thermal reaction, gives a hot xylene insoluble content of at least 2% by weight based on the whole mixture, and the admixed 1,2-PB resin has a hot xylene soluble content of up to 30% by weight based on the whole mixture. To substantiate this requirement by experiments, 10, 30 and 50 parts by weight of 1,2-PB resin [\"PBRB 820,\" product of Japan Synthetic Rubber Co., Ltd., Japan, melt index (hereinafter abbreviated as \"MI\") 2.5 (ASTM D-1238, 150Â° C.)] were kneaded with 100 parts by weight of PP resin [\"NOBLEN EB,\" product of Mitsui Toatsu Co., Ltd., Japan, MI 0.5 (ASTM D-1238, 230Â° C.)] by a Brabender plastograph (\"PLASTI-CORDER PLV 151,\" product of Brabender Co., West Germany) at a jacket temperatures of 190Â° C. and 230Â° C. respectively, and the mixtures were checked for kneading behavior for comparison. The Brabender plastograph is widely used in the plastics molding industry as a device for determining the kneading behavior of molten resins in terms of a kneading torque-time curve while subjecting the resin to a specified shear force and heat. FIGS. 1 and 2 are graphs showing kneading torque-time curves obtained with use of a Brabender device for illustrating the process of this invention in which 1,2-PB resin thermally reacts to produce a hot xylene insoluble reaction product, the curves of FIG. 1 being obtained at a kneading temperature of 190Â° C., and the curves of FIG. 2 at 230Â° C. In FIGS. 1 and 2, curves 1 and 1a represent single use of PP resin, curves 2 and 2a are for PP resin+10 parts of 1,2-PB resin, curves 3 and 3a are for PP resin+30 parts of 1,2-PB resin, and curves 4 and 4a are for PP resin+50 parts of 1,2-PB resin. Comparison between FIGS. 1 and 2 reveal that the kneading torque at 190Â° C. progressively decreases regardless of the proportion of 1,2-PB resin, whereas the kneading torque at 230Â° C. increases with an increase in the proportion of 1,2-PB resin. It is especially noted that the mixtures in FIG. 2 containing 30 and 50 parts by weight of 1,2-PB resin (curves 3a and 4a, respectively) provide S-shaped curves as typical of the vulcanization or curing behavior of resin or rubber while curves 3 and 4 in FIG. 1 progressively decrease. These results indicate that the PP resin and 1,2-PB resin, when kneaded at 190Â° C., form a mere mixture, while at 230Â° C., the 1,2-PB resin undergoes the above-mentioned complex reaction, permitting the resulting reaction product to be intimately entangled with the PP resin and/or 1,2-PB resin to impart an increased melt viscosity to the system. The above experimental results achieved with a Brabender device are closely related with the essential requirement of this invention that the mixture of PP resin and 1,2-PB resin be kneaded in a molten state at an elevated temperature such that the resulting kneaded mixture contains at least 2% by weight of hot xylene insolubles which appear almost entirely attributable to the reaction of the 1,2-PB resin, the mixture further having a hot xylene soluble content of up to 30% by weight afforded by the admixed 1,2-PB resin. It appears from the foregoing results that when a mixture of PP resin and 1,2-PB resin is kneaded under specified conditions, the 1,2-PB resin thereby subjected to heat and shearing stress locally undergoes a complex reaction including intermolecular cross-linking and/or intramolecular cyclization, permitting the reaction product to be intimately entangled with molecular chains of the PP resin and/or unreacted 1,2-PB resin to give an increased melt viscosity to the mixture and consequently reducing the great change of viscoelasticity that otherwise would take place when PP resin is subjected to non-cross-linking extrusion foaming. Highly crystalline PP resins useful as the main starting material to be extruded for practicing this invention include usual commercial isotactic homopolypropylene resin, stereospecific propylene-ethylene random copolymer or stereospecific propylene-ethylene block copolymer incorporating a small amount of copolymerized ethylene, modified polypropylenes containing other monomers as copolymerized for various purposes, and the like. Especially suitable for use are those having a melt index (MI) of up to 2.0 (as measured according to ASTMD-1238). The 1,2-PB resin to be used as admixed with PP resin is a novel thermoplastic resin developed and made commercially available recently. This resin contains at least 70% of vinyl structure (1,2-bonds) and has an intrinsic viscosity (Î·) of at least 0.7 dl/g as measured in toluene at 30Â° C. and a melting point of not lower than 40Â° C. The 1,2-PB resin useful in this invention can be prepared, for example, by the process disclosed in Japanese Patent Publications No. 63159/1966, No. 63160/1966 and No. 45368/1967. (These three applications are combined with priority claim into U.S. Pat. No. 3,498,963). The amount of 1,2-PB resin to be used in this invention, although not particularly limited, is preferably 5 to 50 parts by weight, more preferably 10 to 30 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of PP resin. Use of less than 5 parts by weight of 1,2-PB resin fails to give the desired improved properties to the PP resin, whereas with more than 50 parts by weight of the resin present, the usual economical extrusion kneading method will leave an increased amount of the 1,2-PB resin unreacted, failing to fully alter the viscoelasticity of the PP resin and frequently impairing the foaming properties thereof and also impairing the characteristics of the PP foamed products. For this reason, the 1,2-PB resin should preferably be used in a proportion in the above-mentioned range. The foams obtained according to this invention contain hot xylene insolubles in an amount of at least 2% by weight based on the whole composition comprising the PP resin and 1,2-PB resin in mixture, the admixed 1,2-PB resin further having a hot xylene soluble content of up to 30% by weight based on the whole composition. The foams are so defined for the following reasons. The hot xylene insoluble content should not be less than 2% by weight based on the whole composition because smaller amounts do not mitigate marked changes in the viscoelasticity of the PP resin during extrusion foaming, failing to afford improved extrusion foaming properties as desired. Preferably the insoluble content is at least 4% by weight. Furthermore, the hot xylene insolubles are not defined as being limited only to the thermal reaction product of the 1,2-PB resin because the 1,2-PB resin undergoes a very complex reaction when subjected to heat and shear force as already mentioned, with the likelihood that part of the PP resin will also participate in the cross-linking reaction of the 1,2-PB resin. If it is positively attempted to promote a cross-linking reaction between the PP resin and 1,2-PB resin, suitable amounts of divinylbenzene, triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate, quinonedioxime, quinonedioxime dibenzoate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, triallyl trimellitate, maleic anhydride or like reactive compound and/or organic peroxide, azide compound, and the like can be introduced in the composition. The hot xylene soluble content afforded by the 1,2-PB resin admixed with the PP resin is defined as being limited to not more than 30% by weight based on the whole composition, because with over 30% by weight of the soluble content present, the 1,2-PB resin is almost unable to cause marked changes of viscoelasticity of the PP resin during extrusion foaming, while the 1,2-PB resin, when not reacted, will produce the same result that is attained when a low-viscosity polymer component is incorporated into the PP resin matrix, possibly entailing a lower foamability than when the PP resin is extruded singly. The soluble content is preferably up to 20% by weight, more preferably up to 15% by weight. Thus, the degree of the reaction of the 1,2-PB resin: (a) should be defined as above in terms of hot xylene soluble 1,2-PB resin content as well as insoluble resin content because too great an excess of unreacted 1,2-PB resin in the whole composition impairs process and products of this invention despite the amount of the hot xylene insoluble content including reacted 1,2-PB resin; and (b) should not be defined on the basis of the amount of 1,2-PB resin added to the composition, but should be defined on the basis of the whole composition including PP resin plus the 1,2-PB resin added. The term \"hot xylene soluble content\" refers substantially to unreacted 1,2-PB resin which is inherently fully soluble in xylene even at room temperature, but if it is attempted to dissolve and suspend the foam in xylene at room temperature, a low efficiency will result since the PP resin to be dissolved mainly constituting the foam and the thermally reacted 1,2-PB resin to be suspended is not suspended in xylene at approximately room temperature. Thus, hot xylene is used to suspend the insolubles and to dissolve the soluble component easily at the same time. The term \"hot xylene\" as used in this invention refers to xylene heated at least to a temperature at which PP resin is completely soluble, namely to a temperature of about 130Â° C. to boiling point of about 140Â° C. The composition of PP resin and 1,2-PB resin must be kneaded as by an extruder essentially at an elevated temperature such that the 1,2-PB resin, when partly or wholly subjected to thermal reaction, gives hot xylene insolubles in an amount of at least 2% by weight based on the whole composition, the admixed 1,2-PB resin giving a hot xylene soluble content of up to 30% by weight based on the whole composition. The kneading temperature is not always specifically determinable since the temperature appears to have close relations with many factors such as the kneading time, the shape of the kneading screw, pressure level, the kind of the blowing agent, the kinds of the PP resin and 1,2-PB resin, the amount of the 1,2-PB resin, and the like. Thus, the kneading temperature should be determined for each of the variations of this invention. However, the lower temperature limit will generally be around 200Â° C., while the upper temperature limit will be naturally determined in view of the temperature at which the PP resin and/or 1,2-PB resin will start thermal decomposition or degradation. Preferably, the kneading temperature for the variations of this invention will be in the range of 200Â° to 280Â° C. The inner pressure of the extruder at mixing and kneading PP-resin and 1,2-PB resin also varies depending upon various factors including extrusion output, shape of extruding die, melt viscosity of resin used, shape of screw, kinds of blowing agents and so forth, and will also be determined for each of the variations of this invention. The pressure at each variation may usually be more than 100 kg/cm2 at the metering zone with the use of an ordinal extruder for foaming. Examples of blowing agents useful for this invention are trichloromonofluoromethane, methylene chloride, methyl chloride, dichlorodifluoromethane, dichloromonofluoromethane, monochlorodifluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, trichlorotrifluoroethane and like hydrocarbon halides, propane, butane, pentane, hexane and like aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, esters, ketones, ethers, sodium bicarbonate, azodicarbonamide, N,N'-dinitrosopentamethylenetetramine, p-toluenesulfonylsemicarbazide and like chemical blowing agents. These blowing agents are used singly, or at least two of them are usable in admixture. It is preferable to use organic volatile blowing agents boiling at -40Â° C. to 60Â° C. at atmospheric pressure singly or as a mixture of two or more of such agents. These blowing agents are used in an amount suitably determined in accordance with the foaming degree of the desired product. The present invention will be practiced in the following manner. The PP resin and 1,2-PB resin are mixed together by any of usual methods. Thus the PP resin and 1,2-PB resin may be mixed together in the desired ratio into a masterbatch at pellets which are fed to an extruder. Alternatively, the PP resin and 1,2-PB resin are mixed together in a higher 1,2-PB ratio than the desired ratio into a masterbatch, which is then diluted with a dry blend of the PP resin to the desired ratio and fed to the extruder. Further alternatively, pellets of the resins are dry-blended in the desired ratio as by a ribbon blender and then fed directly to the hopper of the extruder. The composition obtained therewith is mixed and kneaded in the extruder at elevated temperature which is predetermined within the range of 200Â° to 300Â° C. so as to give more than 2% of hot xylene insoluble content and less than 30% of hot xylene soluble content (the most critical feature of the present invention), based on mixting ratio of 1,2-PB resin, kind of PP-resin, kind of 1,2-PB resin, kind and amount of blowing agent, shape of extruder, extrusion output, and so forth which are determined subject to properties required for foamed products. Suitable for use as the extruder is a device adapted to heat the composition at a temperature suited to the thermal reaction of the 1,2-PB resin. Generally it is convenient to use a plastics extruder which may be of any usual type adapted for the production of foams, and an extruder of the autoclave or pressure container type may also be used. The resin may be mixed, kneaded and cooled by a single extruder [or by a plurality of extruder] or by a plurality of extruders connected together. As in the usual extrusion foaming process, the present composition may further incorporate cell nucleus forming agent comprising inorganic chemicals ground into fine powder including talc, zinc white, calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, or the like, citric acid, metal salts of stearic acid, or the like. These cell nucleus forming agent may be used solely or in the mixture thereof. Pigments, flame retardants, stabilizers such as an anti-aging agents against heat or light, plasticizers, and the like may also be used as desired in accordance with the contemplated end use of the foam. Furthermore, the composition may incorporate thermoplastic resins such as aromatic vinyl polymers such as polystyrene, ethylene-Î±-olefin copolymer and the like in amounts that will not greatly impair the properties of the extruded faomed product and extrudability. When the composition contains talc or like inorganic nucleus forming agent or other hot xylene insoluble thermoplastic resins (i.e., hot xylene insoluble thermoplastic resins not derived from the 1,2-PB resin) or the like admixed therewith, the hot xylene insoluble content must be determined exclusive of the amount of such components. The blowing agents are used in this invention in the following manner. Chemical blowing agents are mixed into the masterbatch as by an extruder at a temperature at which the resins will melt but the blowing agent will not decompose, or may be mixed directly with the composition by the dry blending method. Volatile blowing agents can be forced into the composition through an inlet formed in the barrel of the extruder and/or admixed therewith in the form of pellets impregnated with the volatile blowing agent. The molten kneaded mixture of the resin composition and blowing agent of this invention is cooled to a temperature suitable for foaming. The resin extruding temperature can be measured with a resin thermometer extending into the resin flow channel from the wall of an adapter (die head) attached to the forward end of the extruder. The measured value is used as a factor for controlling the foaming of the composition. The resin extruding temperature varies greatly with the kinds of the starting resin, the kind and amount of the blowing agent, and the like and is determined for each of the variations of this invention and usually is within the range of about 140Â° to about 200Â° C. The molten kneaded mixture of the resin composition and blowing agent is extruded thereafter to a low pressure zone through a die attached to the adapter. The said low pressure zone in the present invention means a zone under vacuum pressure or atmospheric pressure, atmospheric pressure is usually preferred. Hot xylene insolubles and hot xylene solubles which are critical in this invention can be identified by the following method. First, the foam obtained is dissolved in hot xylene at 130Â° C. to the boiling point of around 140Â° C. at atmospheric pressure to a concentration of 1 to 2% by weight. If the 1,2-PB resin has reacted thermally, the solution will readily be seen found to be turbid when observed with the unaided eye, thus indicating the presence of insolubles. Although the turbidity can be measured for example in terms of light ray transmittance, a more accurate method is to centrifuge the solution while hot, using the utmost care to avoid a drop of temperature (which would allow the dissolved PP resin component to separate out as crystals), whereby a substance causing the turbidity which is thought to be the thermal reaction product of the 1,2-PB resin can be collected. The substance separated by centrifuging is thoroughly dried and analyzed (e.g., by infrared absorption spectroscopy) to confirm its identity. The hot xylene soluble component of the 1,2-PB resin is also extracted in this procedure. Namely, the solution after separating the thermal reaction product is cooled to separate out PP resin as crystals to determine the hot xylene soluble 1,2-PB resin. In the case that the composition contains talc or like inorganic nucleus forming agent or other hot xylene insoluble thermoplastic resins, such components are tested beforehand to determine whether soluble or insoluble in hot xylene and then net amount of hot xylene insoluble thermal reaction product (Z, weight percent against the whole composition) is determined by the following calculation Zâ•Y--X Wherein X is weight percent of other hot xylene insoluble content in the whole composition such as talc or like inorganic nulceus forming agent or other thermoplastic resins which are predetermined to be insoluble in hot xylene, Y is total amount in weight percent of hot xylene insoluble content in the whole composition of the foam, Z is net amount of hot xylene insoluble thermal reaction product, in weight percent against the whole composition. It is noted that if a considerable amount of the blowing agents used remain in the interior of cells or in the cell walls at the time of determination of hot xylene insolubles (though it may rarely happen), such blowing agents can be removed by heating the sample of foam to a temperature beyond melting points of the resin used. In the following Examples of this specification, solid cylindrical rods and thick plates were prepared as examples of foamed extrudates. Needless to say, the method of the present invention can also be applied for producing foams in the forms of pipe, sheet and the like. Thus the advantages of this invention are not limited to products of particular configuration. The features and advantages of the present invention will be described below with reference to examples and comparison examples, in which the parts and percentages are all by weight. The term \"foaming degree\" as used in this invention is a numerical value (the number of times) expressed by the ratio of the resin density before foaming to the density of the foam obtained. The present invention will become more apparent from the following examples, which however are given for illustrative purposes only and are in no way limitative. EXAMPLE 1 With 100 parts of PP resin (\"NOBLEN EB,\" product of Mitsui Toatsu Co., Ltd., MI 0.5) were fully mixed 20 parts of 1,2-PB (\"JSR-PBRB 820,\" product of Japan Synthetic Rubber Co., Ltd., MI 2.5), 0.1 part of sodium bicarbonate and 0.1 part of citric acid by a ribbon blender, and the mixture was fed at a rate of about 50 kg/hour to a foaming extruder having a cylinder 65 mm in inside diameter, maintained at a temperature of 250Â° to 280Â° C. at the kneading zone. Trichloromonofluoromethane and dichlorotetrafluoroethane compressed under pressure of 100 to 200 kg/cm2 were forced into the extruder, each in a proportion of about 13 parts per 100 parts of the mixture, through a blowing agent inlet provided at an intermediate portion of the extruder. The resins and the blowing agents were cooled with full kneading so as to be extruded at a temperature of 158Â° to 162Â° C., and the composition was extruded into the atmosphere through a cylindrical die 10 mm in inside diameter and attached to an adapter at the forward end of the extruder to obtain a highly foamed product in the shape of a round bar. This foam product will be referred to as \"Specimen A\". The same extrusion procedure as above was repeated except that the 1,2-PB resin was used in the varying proportions of 10, 30 and 50 parts to prepare highly foamed extruded products each in the form of a round bar. These foam products will be referred to as \"Specimens B, C and D\" respectively. Table 1 shows the quality evaluation, hot xylene insoluble content, hot xylene soluble 1,2-PB resin content, etc. of each of Samples A, B, C and D. Table 1 reveals that the use of 1,2-PB resin in admixture with PP resin afforded foams with remarkably improved extrusion foaming characteristics and high foaming degrees. The specimen (Specimen D) containing 50 parts of 1,2-PB resin, however, was found slightly inferior to Specimens A, B and C in every respect because of a higher hot xylene soluble 1,2-PB resin content as shown in Table 1. Non-foamed sheets were prepared from Specimens A, B and D by a heat press and finely divided into pieces, which were tested for flow characteristics by a KOKA Flow Tester (A-method with a nozzle 1 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length, under load of 30 kg/cm2, by raising temperature at the rate of 3Â° C./min from 130Â° C.). FIG. 3 shows the results, revealing that despite the use of 1,2-PB resin much lower than PP resin in melt viscosity, each system exhibits flow behavior indicating a melt viscosity higher than is afforded by the single use of PP resin. Curves A, B, D and PP in FIG. 3 represent Specimens A, B and D of Example 1, and the specimen of PP resin alone of Comparison Example 1, respectively. FIG. 3 appears to show that the apparent viscoelastic properties of the PP resin have been improved. However, Specimen D incorporating 50 parts of 1,2-PB resin has a greater hot xylene soluble 1,2-PB resin content relative to the whole composition and accordingly Specimen D shows higher fluidity than those incorporating 10 and 20 parts of 1,2-PB resin, thus exhibiting flow behavior considerably similar to that of the specimen consisting singly of PP resin, in corresponding relation to the above-mentioned slightly inferior foaming properties thereof.

COMPARISON EXAMPLE 1 A round bar-like foam was prepared at an extruding temperature of about 157Â° to about 160Â° C. by repeating the extrusion foaming procedure of Example 1 under the same condition except that the same PP resin as used in Example 1 was used singly (i.e., without added 1,2-PB resin) as a starting material. Although the foam had an appreciably high foaming degree of about 35 times, unstable extrusion performance resulted with noticeable surface irregularities. The product had in its interior unfoamed cores and communicating voids of varying sizes, hence of low commercial value. COMPARISON EXAMPLE 2 The extrusion foaming procedure of Example 1 was repeated under the same conditions with use of the same resin composition as used for Specimen A of Example 1 except that the cylinder of the kneading zone of the extruder was maintained at a temperature of 190Â° to 200Â° C. Consequently it was almost impossible to extrude the composition at a proper foaming temperature. The product had a low foaming degree of about 12 times, a very uneven cellular structure and a poor surface appearance and was commercially of no value. Not hot xylene insolubes were detected from this specimen, presumably because the temperature of the extruder cylinder providing a melt kneading zone was too low in this comparison example to cause any thermal reaction of the 1,2-PB resin. Consequently, the 1,2-PB resin failed to give improved viscoelasticity to the PP resin during extrusion foaming, merely producing the same result as achieved by a mixture of PP resin and a lower viscous resin. Thus, the foaming performance was even inferior to that achieved by the single use of PP resin. EXAMPLE 2 With 100 parts of PP resin (\"NEBLEN EP,\" product of Mitsui Toatsu Co., Ltd., MI 0.3) were admixed 20 parts of the same 1,2-PB resin as used in Example 1, and 0.4 part of sodium bicarbonate and 0.4 part of citric acid serving as cell nucleus forming agents to prepare a starting composition. Trichloromonofluoromethane and dichlorotetrafluoroethane serving as blowing agents were forced into the composition, in proportions of 21 and 8 parts respectively per 100 parts of the resin mixture. A forming device and a rectangular slit die serving as a foaming die were used. With the exception of these conditions, the composition was extruded for foaming under the same conditions as in Example 1, giving a highly foamed product in the form of a thick rectangular plate about 40 mm in thickness and about 140 mm in width. The composition was extruded at a temperature of about 162Â° to about 163Â° C. The product had a high foaming degree of about 40 times and was a thick homogeneous foam with an attractive surface appearance and a uniform cellular structure. The foam had a hot xylene insoluble content of about 10% based on the whole composition and a hot xylene soluble 1,2-PB resin content of about 7% based on the whole composition. EXAMPLE 3 The extrusion foaming procedure of Example 2 was repeated under the same conditions except that the starting composition was a mixture of 100 parts of PP resin (\"NOBLEN EP,\" product of Mitsui Toatsu Co., Ltd., MI 0.3), 20 parts of 1,2-PB resin (\"JSR-PBRB 820,\" product of Japan Synthetic Rubber Co., Ltd., MI 2.5), 10 parts of PS resin [\"ESBRITE #9.\" product of Showa Yuka Co., Ltd., MI 2.5 (JIS K-6870, 200Â° C.)], and 0.4 part of sodium bicarbonate and 0.4 part of citric acid serving as cell nucleus forming agents, whereby a highly foamed body was prepared in the form of a thick rectangular plate about 42 mm in thickness and about 143 mm in width. The composition was extruded at a temperature of about 162Â° to about 163Â° C. The product had a high foaming degree of about 42 times and was a thick homogeneous foam with an attractive surface appearance, a uniform minutely cellular structure and a high commercial value. The foam had a hot xylene insoluble content of about 8% based on the whole composition and a hot xylene soluble 1,2-PB resin content of about 8% based on the whole composition."

        "text": "DescriptionÂ Â (OCR text may contain errors) _1_ SYNDIOTACTIC 1,2-PODYBUTADIENE SYNTHESIS IN AN AQUEOUS MEDIUM Background of the Invention Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene (SPBD) is a thermoplastic resin which can be utilized in making films, fibers and molded articles. It can a7.so be blended into elastomers, such as polydiene rubbers. Because SPBD contains double bonds which are attached in an alternating fashion to its backbone, it can be cocured with the rubbers in such blends. In fact, SPBD/rubber blends provide a unique combination of properties which make them useful in various tire compounds. United States Patent 4,790,35 discloses that incorporation of SPBD into rubber compositions which are utilized i.n the supporting carcass or innerliner of tires greatly improves the green strength of those compositions. Electron beam precure (microwave precure) is a technique which has gained wide commercial acceptance as a means of improving the green strength of synthetic elastomers which are used in building tires. However, electron beam precure techniques are costly. The incorporation of SPBD into blends of such synthetic elastomers can often improve green strength to the degree that electron beam precure is not required. The incorporation of SPBD into halogenated butyl rubbers which are utilized as the innerliner compositions for tires also greatly improves the scorch safety of such compositions. U.S..Patent 4,274,462 disclosed that pneumatic tires having improved resistance against heat build-up can be prepared by utilizing SPBD fibers in their tread base rubber. According to U.S. Patent 4,790,365, the SPBDutilized in making the supporting carcass for tires has a melting point which is within the range of 120Â°C to 190Â°C and that it is preferred for the SPBD utilized in making the supporting carcass to have a melting point which is within the range of 150Â°C to 165Â°C. The SPBDutilized in making tire innerliners has a melting point which is within the range of 120Â°C to 160Â°C and preferably has a melting point which is within the range of 125Â°C to 150Â°C. The melting points referred to herein are minimum endotherm values determined from DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) curves. Techniques for preparing SPBD by polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer are well known in the art. These techniques include solution polymerization, suspension polymerization and emulsion polymerization. The SPBDmade utilizing these techniques typically have a melting point within the range of about 195Â°C to about 215Â°C. It is accordingly necessary to reduce the melting point of the SPED to render it suitable for utilization in some applications. A process is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,778,424 for the preparation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene which comprises polymerizing 1,3-butadiene in an organic solvent in the presence of a catalyst composition composed of:(a) a cobalt compound, (b) an organoaluminum compound of the formula A1R3, in which R is a hydrocarbon radical of 1-6 carbons, and (c) carbon disulfide. U.S. Patent 3,901,868 reveals a process for producing a butadiene polymer consisting essentially of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene by the successive steps of _3_ (a) preparing a catalyst component solution by dissolving, in an inert organic solvent containing 1,3-butadiene, a cobalt compound, soluble in the organic solvent, such as (i) cobalt-B-diketone complex, (ii) cobalt-~-keto acid ester complex, (iii) cobalt salt of organic carboxylic acid, and (iv) halogenated cobalt-ligand compound complex, and an organoaluminum compound, (b) preparing a catalyst composition by mixing the catalyst component solution (prepared in step a) with an alcohol, lcetone or aldehyde compound and carbon disulfide, (c) -providing a polymerization mixture containing desired amounts of 1,3-butadiene, the catalyst composition and an inert organic solvent, and (d) polymerizing 1,3-butadiene at a temperature which is within the range of -20Â°C to 90Â°C. U.S. Patent 3,901,868 indicates that the melting point of the SPBD produced varies in response to the proportion of alcohol, ketone or aldehyde in the polymerization mixture. U.S. Patent 4,153,7F~7 shows that amide compounds, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, can be used in solution polymerizations to reduce the melting point of SPED being synthesized. U.S. Patent 4,429,085 discloses a process far producing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene by suspension polymerization in an aqueous medium. In this aqueous polymerization process polybutadiene which has an essentially syndiotactic 1,2-microstructure is made by the steps of:(A) preparing a catalyst component solution by dissolving, in an inert organic solvent containing 1,3-butadiene (a) at least one cobalt compound selected from the group consisting of (i) s--diketone complexes of cobalt, (ii) ~-keto acid ester complexes of cobalt, (iii) cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids having 6 to 15 carbon atoms, and (iv) complexes of halagenated cobalt compounds of the formula CoXn, wherez.n Xrepresents a halogen atom and n represents 2 or 3, with an organic compound selected from the group consisting of tertiary amine alcohols, tertiary phosphines, ketones and N,N-dialkylamides, arid (b) at least one organoaltzminum compound of the formula A1R3, wherein Rrepresents a hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms;(B) preparing a reaction mixture by mixing said catalyst component solution with a 1,3-butadiene/water mixture containing desired amounts of said 1,3-butadiene;(C) preparing a polymerization mixture by mixing carbon disulfide throughout said reaction mixture, and (D) polymerizing said 1,3-butadiene in said polymerization mixture into polybutadiene while agitating said polymerization mixture. U.S. Patent 4,751,275 discloses a process for the preparation of SPBD by the solution polymerization of 1,3-butadiene in a hydrocarbon polymerization medium, such as benzene, toluene, cyclohexane, or n-hexane. The catalyst system used in this solution polymerization contains a chromium-III compound which is soluble in hydrocarbons, a trialkylalumi_num compound, and a dialkylphosphite, such as di-neopentylphosphite or di-butylphosphite. U.S. Patent 4,902,761 discloses a process, for preparing a syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene latex by emulsion polymerization which comprises polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer in an aqueous -reaction mixture which is comprised of (1) water, (2) at least one _S-emulsifier, (3) 1,3-butadiene monomer, (4) a catalyst emulsion composition which is prepared by dissolving in an inert organic solvent containing at least one polyene (a) at least one cobalt compound selected from S the group consisting of (i) ~-ketone complexes of cobalt, (ii) ~-keto acid ester complexes of cobalt, (iii) cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids having 6 to 15 carbon atoms, and (iv) complexes of halogenated cobalt compounds of the formula CoXn, wherein Xrepresents a halogen atom and n represents 2 or 3, with an organic compound selected from the group consisting of tertiary amine alcohols, tertiary phosphines, ketones and N,N-dialkylamides, and (b) at least one organoaluminum compound of the formula AlR3 wherein Rrepresents a hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 6 Ccl'rb0'n atoms to produce a catalyst component solution, and microfluidizing the catalyst component solution with an oil, a surfactant, and water to an average particle size which is within the range of about 10 nanometers to about 1000 nanometers; and (5) at least one member selected from the group consisting of carbon disulfide and phenyl isothiocyanate. The synthesis of SPBD in an aqueous medium o:Efers several important advantages over solution polymerizations. Water, as a medium in which to carry out such a polymerization, is less expensive, more easily purified, less sensitive to oxygen, and has a higher heat capacity. Conducting such polymerizations in an aqueous medium also permits for higher monomer and higher solids concentrations because of the lower viscosity of a polymer suspension or emulsion compared with that of a polymer solution. The main drawback associated with aqueous suspension and emulsion polymerizations for producing SPBD is the difficulty associated with reducing the melting point of the SPBD. In other words, it is difficult to control the chemical structure and hence the crystallinity and melting point of SPBD which is synthesized in an aqueous medium. Even though numerous modifiers can be used to reduce the level of crystallinity and resulting melting point of SPBD which is synthesized in solution, highly efficient modifiers for reducing the crystallinity of SPBD which is synthesized in an aqueous medium have heretofore been unknown. Summary of the Invention It has been unexpectedly found that certain aromatic aldehydes can be utilized to reduce the level of crystallinity of SPBD which is synthesized in an aqueous medium in their presence. By reducing the level of crystallinity in the SPBD, its melting point is accordingly reduced. Thus, these aromatic aldehydes can be utilized as modifiers for reducing the melting point of SPBD which is prepared by aqueous suspension polymerization or emulsion polymerization in their presence.

According to another aspect of the present invention, the process may be a solution polymerization process. Detailed Description of the Invention The SPBD made in accordance with the techniques of this invention normally has more than about 70% of its monomeric units in a syndiotactic 1,2-configuration. In most cases, the SPBD made by the process of this invention will have from about 75% to about 95% of its monomeric units in a syndiotactic 1,2-configuration. -8b-In practicing this invention, SPBD is synthesized utilizing aqueous suspension polymerization techniques or emulsion polymerization techniques. The catalyst system and general procedure needed for polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into SPBD is described in U.S. Patent 4,429,085. Such suspension polymerization techniques can be utilized in practising this invention and the teachings of U.S. Patent 4,429,085. A useful technique for preparing SPBD by emulsion polymerization is described in U.S. Patent 4,902,741. The emulsion polymerization procedures described therein can be utilized in the practice of this invention. In practising this invention, 1,3-butadiene monomer is polymerized in an aqueous medium by suspension or emulsion polymerization techniques in the presence of certain aromatic aldehydes which act as modifiers to reduce the level of crystallinity in the SPBD produced. The melting point of SPBD is generally a reflection of the degree of crystallinity in the polymer. The higher the degree of crystallinity, the higher the melting point of the polymer. Thus, by reducing the level of crystallinity in SPBD, its melting point is accordingly reduced. The aromatic aldehydes which can be utilized as modifiers in practising this invention include (a) 4-(alkylamino)benzaldehydes, (b) 4-(dialkylamino)benzaldehydes, (c) 2,4-di-(alkoxy)benzaldehydes, (d) 2,6-di-(alkoxy)benzaldehydes, (e) 2,4,6-tri-(alkoxy)benzaldehydes, and (f) 4-(1-azacycloalkyl)benzaldehydes. The j4-(alkylamino)benzaldehydes which can be utilized as modifiers have the structural formula: R~ ~ 0 N - ~ j C-Hf Hwherein R represents an alkyl group containing from about 1 to about 20 carbon atoms. It is preferred for such alkyl groups to contain from 4 to 8 carbon atoms. The 4-(dialleylamino)benzaldehydes which can be utilized are of the structural formula: - .. N ~ ~ C-H R,r wherein R and R' can be the same or different and are alkyl groups which contain from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. It is preferred for R and R' to be alkyl groups which contain from 1 to about 8 carbon atoms. The 2,4-di-(alkoxy)benzaldehydes which can be employed as modifiers have the structural formula: OR' RO ~ ~ C-I-Iwherein R and R' can be the same or different and represent alkyl groups which contain from 1 to 20 rK~''~a3~~'~~ carbon atoms. It is preferred for R and R' to represent alkyl groups which contain from 1 to 8 carbon atoms. The 2,6-di-(alkoxy)benzaldehydes which can be utilized as modifiers in the practice of this invention are of the structural formula: OR' ii ~ J C-H ORwherein R and R' can be the same or different and represent alkyl groups which contain from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. It is preferred for R and R' to represent alkyl groups which contain from. 1 to 8 carbon atoms. The 2,4,6-tri-(alkoxy)benzaldehydes which can be employed in the practice of this invention as modifiers have the structural formula: OR' R\"0 - \\ , C_H ORwherein R, R' and R\" can be the same or different and represent alkyl groups containing from 1 to 2,0 carbon atoms. It is preferred for R, R' and R\" to represent alkyl groups which contain from 1 to 8 carbon atoms. The 4-(1-azacycloalkyl)benzaldehydes that can be utilized as modifiers axe of the general structural formula: o~'t9~~~'a~t ~ (CH2)nN ~ ~~' C-Hwherein n is an integer from 3 to about 8. It is preferred for n to be an integer from ~E to 6. In other words, it is preferred for the 4-(1-azacycloalkyl)benzaldehyde to be selected from the group consisting of 4-(1-azacyclobutyl)benzaldehyde, 4-(1-azacyclopentyl)benzaldehyde, and 4-(1-azacyclohexyl)benzaldehyde. In practicing this inventian standard suspension or emulsion polymerization techniques are carried out in the presence of the aromatic aldehyde as a modi:Eier. The amount of aromatic aldehyde utilized will depend upon the desired melting point for the SPBI) being prepared. Naturally, larger quantities of the aromatic aldehyde result in lower melting points. Thus, if SPBDhaving a very low melting point is being sought, then a relatively large amount of aromatic aldehyde will be utilized as a modifier in 'the polymerization. In cases where SPBD having only a slightly reduced melting point is sought, a relatively low level of the aromatic aldehyde will be needed. As a general rule, the aqueous polymerization medium will contain from about 0.1 to about 100 millimoles of the aromatic aldehyde per 100 grams of 1,3-butadiene monomer. In most cases from about 0.5 to about 25 millimoles of the aromatic aldehyde will be employed per 100 grams of monomer. Suspension Polymerization The first step in the synthesis of SPBD by suspension polymerization involves 'the preparation of a catalyst component solution. The catalyst component solution is prepared by di.ssolvivg at least one cobalt compound and at least one organoaluminum compound in an inert organic solvent containing at least one conjugated diene which is dissolved therein. The term \"an inert organic solvent\" used herein refers to an organic solvent chemically inert to all of the catalyst components, the emulsifier, the 1,3-butadiene and the SPBD. Some representative examples of inert arganic solvents include aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, alicyclic hydrocarbons, halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, and mixtures of two or more of the above-mentioned compounds. Some representative examples of aromatic hydrocarbons that can be utilized include benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, diethylbenzene or isobutylbenzene. The aliphatic hydrocarbans which can be used include n-hexane, isohexanes, n-heptane, n-octane, i.sooctanes, n-decane, 2,2-dimethylbutane, petroleum ether, kerosene, petroleum spir it or petroleum naphtha, The alicyclic hydrocarbons that can be used include cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane. Some representative examples of halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons 'that can be used include chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzenes or trichlorobenzenes. The cobalt compound usable for the process of the present invention is soluble in an inert organic solvent selected from the group consisting of (i) s-diketone compounds; (ii) s-keto acid ester complexes of cobalt; (iii) cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids having 1 to 25 carbon atoms, and (iv) complexes of halogenated cobalt compounds of the formula CoXn wherein X represents a halogen atom and n represents 2 or 3, with an organic compound selected from the group _13_ consisting of tertiary amines, alcohals, tertiary phosphines, ketones and N,N-dialkylamides. The s-diketone compound which can be used to form a complex with a cobalt atom is of the formula: R1~0~~~0~R4 ,. , 3 wherein Rl and R4, which are the same as or different from one another, are an alkyl radical of 1 to ~ carbon atoms and R2 and R3, which are the same as or different from one another, are a hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. This type of s~-diketone complex of cobalt may be cobalt (II) acetylacetonate or cobalt (IIT) acetylacetonate. The t3-keto acid ester which can be used to form a complex with a cobalt atorti may be of the formula: RlrO..~_~~O~O.r,R~~~3 wherein Rl, R2, R3 and R4 are the same as defined above. This type of cobalt complex may be a cobalt-acetoacetic acid ethyl ester complex. Some representative examples of cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids that can be used include cobalt octoate and cobalt naphthanate. The organoaluminum compound usable for the process of the present invention is of the formula AlR3 wherein R represents a hydrocarbon radical containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The hydrocarbon radical may be an alkyl radical or a cycloalkyl radical containing from _14_ about 1 to about 6 carbon atoms. The hydrocarbon radical may also be an aryl radical. Preferably, the organoaluminum compound will be trimethylaluminum, tri.ethylalumi.num triisobutylaluminum or triphenylaluminum. In the preparation of the catalyst component solution, it is important that the cobalt compound and the organoalumi.num compound are dissolved in the inert organic solvent containing at least one conjugated dime. Some conjugated dienes that can be used in making the catalyst component solution include 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-pentad:iene, isoprene and myrcene. If the preparation is carried out in the absence of a conjugated dime, the resultant catalyst component solution is not effective as a component of the catalyst composition of the present invention. The conjugated dime is preferably used in a rat:i.o by mule of at least 5, more preferably, within the range of 10 to 100, and most preferably within the range of 15 to 30, to the amount by mole of the cobalt compound to be used in the catalyst component solution. The preferred conjugated dimes for use in this invention are 1,3-butadiene and isoprene. The most preferred polyene is 1,3-butadiene. The catalyst component solution is preferably prepared at a temperature of -25Â°C to 50Â°C and preferably contains 0.0005 to 1.0 moles per liter., and more preferably 0.001 to 0.5 moles per liter of the cobalt compound. The temperature at which the catalyst component solution is prepared will more preferably be within the range of -10Â°C to 10Â°C and it is also highly desirable to use vigorous agitation in the preparation of the catalyst component solution. The ratio by mole of the organoaluminum compound to the cobalt compound a~~~~~'~~~ is preferably in a range from 0.2 to 50, more preferably, within the range of from 1 to 20, and most preferably within the range of 2 to 10. In the preparation of the catalyst component solution, it is preferred for the cobalt campound to be first dissolved in the inert organic solvent in the presence of the polyene monomer and then for the organoaluminum compound to be added to the solution. However, very satisfactory results can also be obtained when the organoaluminum compound is added first. In the preparation of this catalyst component solution, the organoaluminum compound should not be allowed to come in contact with water. This is because water can completely decompose such organoaluminum compounds. Accordingly, it is preferable that the inert organic solvent to be used to prepare the catalyst component solution be preliminarily dehydrated at least up to a content of water which is insufficient to completely decompose a significant amount of the organoa2uminum compound. It is preferable that the catalyst component solution be prepared using a dry (essentially water free) inert organic solvent. However, a trace of water in the inert organic solvent can be present up to a concentration of about 500 ppm (parts per million by weight). It is preferred for no more than 50 ppm o.f water to be present in the inert organic solvent used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution. If a sufficient amount of water is present in the inert organic solvent used in the preparation of th,e catalyst component solution, the catalyst can be completely destroyed. The catalyst component solution will preferably be stored under an inert gas atmosphere, such as nitrogen, in the absence of sunlight or ultraviolet light. -1~-It is desirable to allow the prereaction used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution to run for a period of at least 30 seconds, and more preferably for at least 1 minute before mixing the catalyst component salution with tree oil, surfactant, and water used in making the catalyst emulsion composition. Longer time periods can be used without the catalyst component solution losing its activity. In fact, the catalyst component solution can be stored for many weeks without losing activity if stored under an inert atmosphere. After the organoaluminum compound has been incorporated in the catalyst component solution using the above-described technique, the catalyst becomes stable to water. This is presumably because of the formation of a l~'~' -allyl cobalt active specie. It is believed that it is this '~ -allyl bonding to the cobalt meta7_ atom that imparts stability to this catalyst component, possibly by providing some hydrophobic shielding of the cobalt atom from water. Stability in polar solvents are well know for ' ~-allyl complexes of other Group ~lIII transition metals of the periodic table to which cobalt belongs. In the second step of the suspension polymerization procedure, a reaction mixture is prepared by mixing the catalyst component solution with a 1,3-butadiene/water mixture. The aromatic aldehyde modifier will also be added to the reaction mixture in the desired amount. Apartitioning agent, such as gelatin, will be included in the reaction mixture to obtain a small polymer particle size. The amount of partitioning agent to be employed will perferably be within the range of about 0.75 to about 1.5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of 1,3-butadiene monomer to be polymerized. a~~~~~ ~ ~ This 1,3-butadiene/water mixture can contain from as little as about 2% butadiene to as much as about 50%butadiene by weight. It is preferred for this 1,3-butadiene/water mixture to contain from 15% to 35%by weight butadiene and it is more vpreferred for it to contain about 20 to 25% butadiene by weight. Since 1,3-butadiene is very volatile, it ~wil1 be necessary to prepare this mixture in a closed system. Agitation will be provided in the preparation of the reaction mixture in order to insure formation of monomer droplets containing the catalyst component solution are distributed uniformly throughout the mixture. Since 1,3-butadiene is essentially insoluble in water, it will be present in this mixture in the form of droplets which are distributed throughout the mixture. If agitation is discontinued, there will be a separation of the organic and aqueous components o:E this rn:Lxture into two layers. The organic and aqueous layers of this reaction mixture can be mixed together again by agitating the reaction mixture. In the third step of the suspension polymerization process, a polymerization mixture is prepared by adding carbon disulfide to the above-described reaction mixture. The molar ratio of carbon disulfide to 1,3-butadiene monomer will vary between about 1:600 and 1:2800. The molar ratio of carbon disulfide to monomer will preferably be within the range of about 1:1200 to about 1:1400. The molar ratio of monomer to cobalt will be within the range of 2500:1 to 10,000:1 and will preferably be within the range of 4500:1 to 5500:1. In the final step of the suspension polymerization, the 1,3-butadiene monomer in the polymerization mixture is converted into polybutadiene while agitating the polymerization mixture. If the use of an antioxidant -lg-is desired, it may be added conveniently at the beginning of the polymerization. This polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer can be carried out at a temperature from about -20Â°C to about 60Â°C. It is preferable for the polymerization temperature to be from -10Â°C to 40Â°C. The most preferred polymerization temperature is about 0Â°C to 10Â°C. At temperatures below 0Â°C, an agent which will lower the freezing point of water can be added to the polymerization mixture to keep it from freezing. This polymerization can be carried out either under a normal pressure or in a pressurized system. This polymerization can be carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere with good results. Such a polymerization can be run for a period of from about 1 to about 30 hours. It is generally preferred for the polymerization to be run for about 8 to about 10 hours. However, the optimum polymerization time will vary greatly with the polymerization temperature, catalyst, the amount of catalyst used, etc. The polybutadiene formed using the process of this invention will float to 'the surface of the polymerization mixture and can easily be recovered. Emulsion Polymerization In cases where SPBD is made by emulsion polymerization, a catalyst component solution is made utilizing the same techniques that are employed in making catalyst component solutions for suspension polymerizations. Then, a catalyst emulsion composition is prepared by microfluidizing or microemulsifying the catalyst component solution with an oil, a surfactant and water. In preparing the catalyst emulsion composition, it is highly desirable to first mix_ the catalyst component solution with the oi.l and to separately mix the surfactant with the water. The catalyst component solution/oil mixture is then subsequently mixed with the surfactant/water mixture immediately prior to the microfluidization. The ratio of oil to catalyst component solution will normally be within the range of about 0.5 to 30. It is normally preferred for the ratio of oil to catalyst component solution to be within the range of about 1 to about 10 and it is typically most preferred for the oil. to catalyst component solution ratio to be within the range of about 2 to about 3. For example, a weight ratio of oi_1 to catalyst component solution of about 2.5:1 is highly preferred. The weight ratio of water to catalyst component solution utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition is typically within the .range of about 5 to about 80. It is normally preferred for the weight ratio of water to catalyst component solution to be within the range of about 10 to about 50. In most cases it will be more preferred for the weight ratio of water to catalyst component solution utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition to be within the range of about 20 to about 30. For instance, a weight ratio of water to catalyst component solution of about 27:1 is highly preferred for utilization in preparing the catalyst emulsion compositions of this invention. The weight ratio of surfactant to catalyst component solution utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition will typically be within the range of about 0.001 to about 10. In most cases it will be preferred to utilize a weight ratio of surfactant to catalyst component solution which is within the range of about 0.05 to 5. _20_ It is typically more preferred to utilize a ratio of surfactant to catalyst component solution which is within the range of about 0.1 to 0.3. Accordingly, a weight ratio of surfactant to catalyst component solution of about 0.2:1 is highly preferred. The oil utilized it preparing the catalyst emulsion composition will typically be a long chain paraffinic oil. Such oils will generally be mixtures of various long chain hydrocarbons which contain from about 12 to about 28 carbon atoms. It is generally preferred for these compounds to be saturated. The oil will preferably be comprised of hydrocarbon compounds which contain from about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms. It is possible to utilize long chain alcohols which contain from about 12 to about 28 carbon atoms as the oil. 'fhe utilization of such alcohols results in the SPBD being synthesized having a lower melting point. Tt is, accordingly, desirable to use such alcohols as the oil if SPBD having a low melting point is desired. On the other hand, if SPBD having a high melting point is sought, then it will not be desirable to utilize alcohols as the oil. It is, of course, also possible to utilize a combination of paraffinic oils and alcohols to adjust the melting point of the SPBD as desired. The surfactant utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition will normally be an anionic surfactant or a nonionic surfactant. Some representative examples of types of anionic surfactants which can be utilized include carboxylates, alkylbenzene sulfonates, alkane sulfonates, a-olefin sulfonates, fatty alcohol sulfates, and oxo-alcohol sulfates. Some representative examples of types of nonionic surfactants which can be utilized include ~:~~~Ea i ~ alkylphenol ethoxylates, fatty-alcohol polyethyleneglycol ethers, oxo-alcohol polyethyleneglycol ethers, ethylene oxide polymers, propylene oxide polymers, and fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers. It is generally preferred for the surfactant to be an anionic surfactant with alkyl benzene sulfonates, fatty alcohol sulfates, and oxo-alcohol ether sulfates being most preferred. The alkyl benzene sulfonates which are utilized generally have the structural formula: R ~ S03Na wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 8 to 18 carbon atoms and preferably wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 10 to 13 carbon atoms. The fatty alcohol sulfates which can be utilized normally have the structural formula:' R-0-S03Na wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 6 to 28 carbon atoms and preferably wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 11 to 17 carbon atoms. The oxo-alcohol ether sulfates which can be utilized generally have the structural formula: R' R-CH-CH2-0-ECH2-CH2-03-nS03Na wherein n is an integer from 1 to about 4 and wherein Rand R' represent alkyl groups which can be the same or different with the total number of carbon atoms in Rand R' ranging from about 11 to about 13. ~~ The microfluidization procedure utilized results in the formation of a catalyst emulsion composition which has an average particle size which is within the range of about 10 to about 1,000 manometers. The catalyst emulsion composition prepared will preferably have an average particle size which is within the range of about 30 to about 600 manometers and will more preferably have an average particle size which is within the .range of about 60 to about 300 manometers. This microfluidization procedure can be carried out utilizing conventional microfluidizers or other equipment which is capable of homogenizing the catalyst emulsion composition to the desired particle size. For instance, the microfluidization can be carried out utilizing a high pressure pump or series of pumps. Ultrasonic and/or mechanical means can be utilized in the microfl.uidization procedure. To attain the desired particle size, it may be advantageous to pass 'the catalyst emulsion composition which is being prepared through the MicrofluidizerTM more than one time. The catalyst component solution utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition is stable over long periods of time and can be stored far long periods without losing its activity. However, it is highly desirable to utilize the catalyst emulsion composition as soon as possible after it is prepared because the catalyst emulsion composition loses its activity over time. In practice, the catalyst emulsion composition loses essentially all of its activity after about 24 hours of being stored at room temperature. It is, accordingly, important to use the catalyst emulsian composition as soon as possible after its preparation. The aqueous reaction mixture is prepared by mixing (1) water, (2) at least one emulsifier, (3) 1,3-butadiene monomer, f.4) the catalyst emulsion composition, (5) carbon disulfide and (6) the aromatic aldehyde modifier. Water is the major component in the aqueous reaction mixture. The amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer in the aqueous reaction mixture will vary from about 2 weight percent to about SO weight percent. However, in most cases it will be preferred for the aqueous reaction mixture to contain from about 10 weight percent to about 40 weight percent 1,3-butadiene monomer. It will generally be more preferred for the aqueous reaction mixture to contain from about 20 to about 30 weight percent 1,3-butadiene monomer. The amount of emulsifier utilized in preparing the aqueous reaction mixture will normally be within the range of about 0.1 phm to about 10 phm (parts per hundred parts of monomer). It will normallÅ¤ be preferred for the emulsifier to be present in an amount ranging from about 0.5 phm to about 5 phm, Tn most cases, it will be more preferred fox the emulsifier to be present in an amount within the range of about 1 phm to about 3 phm. The emulsifiers used in the emulsion polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into SpBD may be charged at the outset of the polymerization or may be added incrementally or by proportioning as the reaction proceeds. Generally, anionic emulsifier systems provide good results, however, any of the general types of anionic, cationic or nonionic emulsifiers may be employed in the polymerization. Among the anionic emulsifiers that can be employed in such emulsion polymerizations are fatty acids and their alkali metal soaps such as caprylic acid, capric acid, pelargonic acid, lauric acid, undecyclic acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic ~s~ss~7~ acid, arachidic acid, and the like; amine soaps of fatty acids such as those formed from ammonia, mono-and dialkyl amines, substituted hydrazines, guanidine and various low molecular weight diamines;chain--substituted derivatives of fatty acids such as those having alkyl stzbstituents; naphthenic acids and their soaps and the like; sulfuric esters and their salts, such as 'the tallow alcohol sulfates, coconut alcohol sulfates, fatty alcohol sulfates, such as oleyl sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate and the Like; sterol sulfates; sulfates of alkylcyclohexanols, sulfation products of lower polymers of ethylene as C10 to C20 straight chain olefins, and other hydrocarbon mixtures, sulfuric esters of aliphatic and aromatic alcohols having intermediate linkages, such as ether, ester, or amide groups such as alkylbenzyl (polyethyleneoxy) alcohols, the sodium salt o.f tridecyl ether sulfate;alkane sulfonates, esters and salts, such as alkylchloxosulfonates with the general formula RS02C1, wherein R is an alkyl group having Pram 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and alkylsulfonates with the genexal formula RS02-OH, wherein R is an alkyl group having from l to 20 carbon atoms; sulfonates with intermediate linkages such as ester and ester-linked sulfonates such as those having the formula RC00C2H4S03H and ROOC-CH2-S03H;wherein R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms such as dialkyl sulfosuccinates; ester salts with the general formula: S03Na wherein R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms; alkylaryl sulfonates in which the alkyl groups contain preferably from 10 to 20 carbon atoms, e.g.dodecylbenzenesulfonates, such as sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate; alkyl phenol sulfonates; sulfonic acids and their salts such as acids with the formula RS03Na, wherein R is an alkyl and the like; sulfonamides;sulfamido methylenesulfonic acids; rosin acids and their soaps; sulfonated derivatives of rosin and rosin oil; and lignin sulfonates, and the like. Carboxylate emulsifiers are highly preferred. This is because their utilization leads to less build-up on the walls of the polymerization reactor. Fatty acid soaps and rosin acid soaps are representative examples of highly preferred carboxylate soaps. Of rosin acids, about 90 percent are isometric with abietic acid and the other 10 percent is a mixture of dehydro abietic acid and dihydro abietic acid. Agitation should be provided in the. preparation of the aqueous reaction mixture to ensure that the catalyst emulsion composition, the monomer, and the surfactant are distributed essentially homogeneously throughout the mixture. Since 1,3-butadiene monomer is very volatile, it will be necessary to prepare the aqueous reaction mixture under pressure in a closed system. The carbon disulfide is typically the last component to be added to the aqueous .reaction mixture. The addition of carbon disulfide to the reaction mixture which already contains the catalyst emulsion composition will initiate the polymerization reaction. The amount of carbon disulfide that can be added will vary between 0.005 phm and 2 phm. More preferably, the amount of carbon disulfide added will vary between 0.001 and 1 phm. ac:~~~i~~~~ In the process of the present invention, the larger the proportion of the carbon disulfide in a range from about 0.0005 phm to about 0.5 phm in the polymerization mixture, the larger the yield of the SPBD obtained from the polymerization mixture. However, too large an amount of carbon disulfide, for example, larger than about 0.5 phm, causes a decrease in the polymer yield. The 1,3-butadiene monomer is polymerized into SPBDwhile agitating the polymerization mixture. If the use of an antioxidant is desired, it may be added conveniently at the beginning of the polymerization. This polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer can be carried out at a temperature from about -20Â°C to about 90Â°C. It is preferable for the polymerization temperature to be from -10Â°C to 40Â°C. The most preferred polymerization temperature is about 0Â°C to about 10Â°C. At temperatures below 0Â°C, an antifreeze agent can be added to the polymerization mixture to keep it from freezing. This polymerization can be carried out either under a normal pressure or in a pressurized system. This polymerization can be carried out under an inert gas atmosphere, such as a nitrogen atmosphere, with good results. Such a polymerization can be run for a period of from about 3 to about 30 hours. It is generally preferred for the polymerization to be run for a period which is within the range of about 10 to 1b hours. However, the optimum polymerization time will vary greatly with the polymerization temperature, catalyst, the amount of catalyst used, etc. In most cases, the optimum polymerization time will be within the range of about 12 to about 14 hours. After the polymerization has been completed, the SPBD can be recovered from the latex by standard coagulation techniques. For instance, coagulation can be accomplished by adding acids or blends of salts with acids to the latex. For example, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, blends of sodium chloride with sulfuric acid and blends of hydrochloric acid with methanol are very effective as coagulating agents. Calcium chloride solutions and blends of calcium chloride c~ith various acids can also be utilized as coagulants. Salt/acid coagulants are generally preferred. For instance, the utilization of sulfuric acid with sodium chloride or potassium chloride as the coagulant will lead to good results. Barium chloride and magnesium sulfate are additional examples of divalent salts which are suitable for utilization in coagulating the SPBD latex. It may also be advantageous to employ materials classified as coagulation aids, such as high molecular weight polyelectrolytes, in the coagulation of the SPBD latex. The preferred coagulation aids are weak bases. Some representative examples of suitable coagulation aids which can be used include NalcoTM 108 (Nalco Chemical Company?, DaxadTM CP-1 (W. R. Grace and Company), and similar materials that are also weakly basic polyelectrolytes. The quantity of coagulant required will vary with the emulsifier, the amount of emulsifier used, the rubber being coagulated, and the type of coagulant being employed. Generally, the optimum type of coagulant, quantity of coagulant and coagulating conditions can be determined using a trial and error approach. The following working examples illustrate various embodiments of the process of the present invention. These examples are intended merely to illustrate the present invention and not in any sense to limit the ~~~~6~~_28-scope in which the present invention can be practiced. Unless specifically indicated otherwise, parts and percentages are given by weight. Examples 1-8 In this series of experiments, SPBD was synthesized by aqueous suspension polymerization utilizing varying amounts of 4-(dimethylamino)benzaldehydes as a modifier. A catalyst component solution was prepared by charging 8.97 grams (0.026 moles) of cobalt octanoate, 400 ml of dry hexane, and 27 g of 1,3-butadiene into a dry one liter bottle equipped with a self-sealing cap. The bottle was capped under nitrogen and 72 ml of a 1.54 ri hexane solution of triethylaluminum was added by injecting it into the bottle with a syringe with ice water being utilized as a coolant. The catalyst component solution was allowed to age far at least 30 minutes before it was used. In the procedure used, 40 lbs. (18.1 kg) of deoxygenated water containing 40 grams of gelatin and 120 grams of potassium chloride was charged into a 10 gallon (37.9 liter) reactor which was equipped with a stirrer (3 axially-flow turbine blades) and baffles. Ahexane solution containing 70 grams of 2,6-di-t-butyl-p-cresol and the amount of 4-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde modifier specified in Table I was then added and air was evacuated from the reactor. The mixture was stirred with cooling until reaching a temperature of 10Â°G. Using pressurized cylinders, 10 lbs. (4,540 grams) of 1,3-butadiene monomer and 230 grams of the cobalt catalyst component solution were introduced into the reactor. The mixture was stirred at a speed of 300 rpm for 25 minutes. Then, 230 grams of a 0.2 M carbon disulfide in hexane solution was added. After allowing the polymerizations to proceed for a period of about 8 to about 10 hours, the SPBD was recovered by filtration and drying. Good yields of greater than 90% were obtained. Using differential scanning calorimetry, the melting point of the SPEDsamples prepared in this series of experiments were determined and are reported in Table I. Table I4-(dimethylamino)- SPBDbenzaldehyde level Melting Example (mmoles/100 g of butadiene) Point 1 (Control) 0 194Â°C2 1.0 173Â°C3 2.5 145Â°C4 5.0 13bÂ°C 5 7,5 130Â°C1p,0 125Â°C7 15.0 120Â°Cg 20.0 115Â°C Table I clearly shows that 4-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde is very effective as a modifier for reducing the melting point of SPBDsynthesized in its presence. The unmodified SPBD made in the control (Example 1) had a melting point of 194Â°C. The melting point of the SPBD produced was reduced with increasing levels of the 4-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde modifier. In Example 8, the utilization of 20 mmoles of modifier per 100 grams of monomer resulted in a melting point reduction of almost 80Â°C with the SPBD produced in Example 8 having a melting point of only about 115Â°C. Examples 9-12 The effect that 4-(dialkylamino)benzaldehydes have on the melting point of SPBD synthesized in their presence does not result from the dimethylamino function or the aldehyde function independently of each other. In other words, both the dialkylamino moiety and the aldehyde moiety must be attached to the same aromatic moiety conjugated to each other. That is, they must be either ortho or pare to each other. This is known because neither dimethyl aniline nor benzaldehyde were found to be very effective as melting point modifiers for reducing the melting point of SPBDsynthesized in their presence. In these experiments, the general procedure described in Examples 1-8 was repeated. F~owever, in these experiments, either dimethyl aniline or benzal.dehyde was substituted for the 4-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde employed in Examples 2-8. The amount o.f dimethyl aniline or benzaldehyde utilized and the melting point of the SPBD produced in their presence is shown in Table II. Table II SPBD Modifier Level rlelting Example Modifier (mmoles/100 g monomer)Point 9 dimethylaniline7 192C 10 dimethylaniline20 185C 11 benzaldehyde 5 18~EC 12 benzaldehyde 12.5 179C As can be seen, neither the dimethylaniline nor the benzaldehyde were very effective at reducing the a~~~'~~'~~ melting point of the SPBD produced. Even at relatively high concentrations, the dimethylaniline and benzaldehyde only reduced the melting paint of the SPBDslightly. For instance, at a level of 20 mmoles per 100 grams of butadiene monomer, the dimethylaniline , only reduced the melting point of the SPED to 185Â°C. At the same concentration, the 4-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde reduced the melting point of the SPBD synthesized in its presence to 115Â°C, Benzaldehyde was found to be slightly more effective as a modifier. However, it was certainly not very effective. For instance, at a level of 12.5 mmoles per 100 grams of monomer, the benzaldehyde only reduced the melting point of the SPBD synthesized in its presence to 179Â°C. At a concentration of 10 mmoles per 100 grams of monomer, the 4-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde reduced the melting goint of the SPED prepared in its presence to 125Â°C. Thus, it is very apparent that neither benzaldehyde nar dimethylbenzaldehyde are very effective as modifiers for reducing the level of crystallinity in SPBD and its corresponding melting point. Examples 13-14 In these experiments, the general procedure described in Examples 1-8 was utilized except that 2,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde was utilized as the modifier. The amount of 2,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde employed, the yield attained and the melting point of the SPBDproduced are reported in Table III. As can b,e seen, the 2,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde proved to be very effective as a modifier.

In these experiments, 3,5-dimethaxybenzaldehyde was substituted .for the 2,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde utilized in Examples 13 and 14. As i_s shown in Table IV, the 3,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde did not reduce the melting point of the SPBD synthesized in its presence effectively. Table IV shows the amount of 3,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde employed as a modifier and the melting point of the SPBD which was prepared in its presence. Table IV SPBD3,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde level Melting Example _ (mmoles/100 g of monomer) Point 15 5 188Â°C16 12.5 179Â°C As can be seen in Example 16, the 3,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde reduced the melting point of the SPBD produced in its presence to only 179Â°C. The 2,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde utilized in Example 13 at a level of 10 mmoles per 100 grams of monomer reduced the melting point of the SPBD synthesized in its presence to 135Â°C. Thus, these comparative experiments clearly show the importance of the methoxy moieties being in the ortho and/or para positions. While certain representative embodiments and details have been shown for the purpose of illustrating the subject invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in this art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the scope of this invention."

        "text": "Description This application is a continuation of U.S. Ser. No. 09/475,723, filed on Dec. 30, 1999, U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,888. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed toward a process for producing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers. More particularly, the process of this invention comprises polymerizing 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement by using an iron-based catalyst composition that is formed by combining an iron-containing compound, a hydrogen phosphite, and an organoaluminum compound. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is a crystalline thermoplastic resin that has a stereoregular structure in which the side-chain vinyl groups are located alternately on the opposite sides in relation to the polymeric main chain. Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is a unique material that exhibits the properties of both plastics and rubber, and therefore it has many uses. For example, films, fibers, and various molded articles can be made by utilizing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. It can also be blended into and co-cured with natural and synthetic rubbers. Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene can be made by solution, emulsion, or suspension polymerization. Generally, syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene has a melting temperature within the range of about 195Â° C. to about 215Â° C., but due to processability considerations, it is generally desirable for syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to have a melting temperature of less than about 195Â° C. Because syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is insoluble in common solvents at normal polymerization temperatures, a common technical difficulty in the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is that the polymerization mixture is an extremely thick slurry at the commercially desirable polymer concentration of 10% to 25% by weight. This thick slurry becomes difficult to stir and transfer, thereby diminishing heat transfer efficiency and interfering with proper process control. Also, the slurry contributes to reactor fouling due to the undesirable build-up of insoluble polymer on the baffles, agitator blades, agitator shafts, and walls of the polymerization reactor. It is therefore necessary to clean the reactor on a regular basis, which results in frequent shutdowns of continuous processes and serious limitations of the run length of batch processes. The task of cleaning the fouled reactor is generally difficult and time-consuming. All of these drawbacks detrimentally affect productivity and the cost of operation. It would be advantageous to develop a method of synthesizing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene that avoids this frequent reactor fouling problem. Various transition metal catalyst systems based on cobalt, titanium, vanadium, chromium, and molybdenum for the preparation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene have been reported. The majority of these catalyst systems, however, have no practical utility because they have low catalytic activity or poor stereoselectivity, and in some cases they produce low molecular weight polymers or partially crosslinked polymers unsuitable for commercial use. The following two cobalt-based catalyst systems are well known for the preparation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene on a commercial scale: (1) a catalyst system containing cobalt bis(acetylacetonate), triethylaluminum, water, and triphenylphosphine (U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,498,963 and 4,182,813), and (2) a catalyst system containing cobalt tris(acetylacetonate), triethylaluminum, and carbon disulfide (U.S. Pat. No. 3,778,424). These cobalt-based catalyst systems also have serious disadvantages. The first cobalt catalyst system referenced above yields syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene having very low crystallinity. Also, this catalyst system develops sufficient catalytic activity only when halogenated hydrocarbon solvents are used as the polymerization medium, and halogenated solvents present toxicity problems. The second cobalt catalyst system referenced above uses carbon disulfide as one of the catalyst components. Because of its low flash point, obnoxious smell, high volatility, and toxicity, carbon disulfide is difficult and dangerous to use, and requires expensive safety measures to prevent even minimal amounts escaping into the atmosphere. Furthermore, the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene produced with this cobalt catalyst system has a very high melting temperature of about 200-210Â° C., which makes it difficult to process the polymer. Although the melting temperature of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene produced with this cobalt catalyst system can be reduced by employing a catalyst modifier as a fourth catalyst component, the presence of this catalyst modifier has adverse effects on the catalyst activity and polymer yields. Accordingly, many restrictions are required for the industrial utilization of these cobalt-based catalyst systems. It is well known that the physical properties of rubbery elastomers can be improved by blending crystalline polymers therein. For example, incorporating syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene into rubber compositions that are utilized in the supporting carcass of tires greatly improves the green strength of those compositions. Also, incorporating syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene into tire tread compositions can reduce the heat build-up and improve the wear characteristics of tires. The green strength of synthetic rubbers such as cis-1,4-polybutadiene can also be improved by incorporating a small amount of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Blends of crystalline polymers and rubbery elastomers are typically prepared by standard mixing techniques. For example, these blends can be prepared by mixing or kneading and heat-treating a crystalline polymer and a rubbery elastomer by utilizing generally known mixing equipment such as a Banbury mixer, a Brabender mixer, an extruder, a kneader, or a mill mixer. These high-temperature mixing procedures, however, have certain drawbacks including high processing costs, polymer degradation and crosslinking, inadequate mixing, as well as various process limitations. Due to the high vinyl content of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene, polymer degradation and crosslinking is a particularly severe problem for mixing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene with elastomers at high temperatures. Attempts to polymerize 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement have been hampered by the same catalyst inefficiencies and toxicities mentioned above. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,379,889 teaches polymerizing 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement by using a catalyst system comprising a cobalt compound, a dialkylaluminum halide, carbon disulfide, and an electron donative compound. And, U.S. Pat. No. 5,283,294 teaches a similar process that employs a catalyst system comprising a cobalt compound, an organoaluminum compound, and carbon disulfide. These methods, however, are inferior because the catalyst systems that are employed suffer from the foregoing disadvantages. Therefore, it would be advantageous to develop a new and significantly improved process for producing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In general, the present invention provides a process for preparing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers comprising the steps of (1) providing a mixture of a rubber cement and 1,3-butadiene monomer, and (2) polymerizing the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement by using a catalyst composition that is the combination of or the reaction product of ingredients comprising an iron-containing compound, a hydrogen phosphite, and an organoaluminum compound. The present invention further provides a process for producing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers comprising the steps of (1) providing a mixture of a rubber cement and 1,3-butadiene monomer, and (2) polymerizing the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement by using a catalyst composition that is formed by combining an iron-containing compound, a hydrogen phosphite, and an organoaluminum compound. The present invention also provides a blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers prepared by a process comprising the steps of (1) providing a mixture of a rubber cement and 1,3-butadiene monomer, and (2) polymerizing the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement by using a catalyst composition that is the combination of or the reaction product of ingredients comprising an iron-containing compound, a hydrogen phosphite, and an organoaluminum compound. Advantageously, the process of this invention directly provides blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers by synthesizing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement and thereby obviates the need for high-temperature mixing. Also, good dispersion of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene throughout rubbery elastomers can be easily and economically achieved. Significantly, the process of this invention eliminates the problems of high processing costs, polymer degradation and crosslinking, inadequate mixing, and various process limitations that are associated with high-temperature mixing procedures. The process of this invention also alleviates the problems of polymer cement thickness and reactor fouling that are associated with the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in the absence of a rubbery elastomer. In addition, the iron-based catalyst system employed in this invention has very high catalytic activity and stereoselectivity for the syndiospecific polymerization of 1,3-butadiene. This activity and selectivity, among other advantages, allows syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to be produced in very high yields within a rubber cement. Moreover, this iron-based catalyst composition is very versatile and capable of producing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene with a wide range of melting temperatures without the need for a catalyst modifier that may have adverse effects on the catalyst activity and polymer yields. Additionally, this catalyst composition does not contain carbon disulfide, and therefore the toxicity, objectionable smell, dangers, and expense associated with the use of carbon disulfide are eliminated. Further, this catalyst composition is iron-based, and iron compounds are generally stable, inexpensive, relatively innocuous, and readily available. Furthermore, this catalyst composition has high catalytic activity in a wide variety of solvents including the environmentally-preferred nonhalogenated solvents such as aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS The present invention is generally directed toward a process for producing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubber elastomers. It has now been found that blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers can be directly produced by polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubbery cement by using an iron-based catalyst composition. According to the process of the present invention, blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers are produced by the steps of: (1) providing a mixture of a rubber cement and 1,3-butadiene monomer, where the rubber cement includes at least one rubbery elastomer within an organic solvent, and (2) polymerizing the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement by using an iron-based catalyst composition. The iron-based catalyst composition employed to synthesize the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene comprises (a) an iron-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organoaluminum compound. Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention is directed toward the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement, other conjugated diene monomers can be polymerized by using the iron-based catalyst composition to form conjugated diene polymers, preferably crystalline polymers, within a rubber cement. The rubber cement employed in this invention is a solution, preferably viscous, of at least one rubbery elastomer in an organic solvent. Virtually any type of rubbery elastomer can be used to prepare the rubber cement. Some specific examples of suitable rubbery elastomers include, but are not limited to, natural rubber, cis-1,4-polybutadiene, amorphous 1,2-polybutadiene, polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, neoprene, ethylene-propylene copolymer rubber (EPR), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), styrene-isoprene rubber (SIR), styrene-isoprene-butadiene rubber (SIBR), styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SBS), styrene-butadiene block copolymer (SB), hydrogenated styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SEBS), hydrogenated styrene-butadiene block copolymer (SEB), styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer (SIS), styrene-isoprene block copolymer (SI), hydrogenated styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer (SEPS), hydrogenated styrene-isoprene block copolymer (SEP), polysulfide rubber, acrylic rubber, urethane rubber, silicone rubber, epichlorohydrin rubber, and the like. Mixtures of the above rubbery elastomers may also be used. These rubbery elastomers are well known and, for the most part, are commercially available. Also, those skilled in the art will be able to readily synthesize these rubbery elastomers by using techniques that are well known in the art. The rubber cement can be prepared by dissolving the above-mentioned rubbery elastomers in an organic solvent. When commercially available rubbery elastomers are employed to prepare the rubber cement, it may be necessary to purify the commercial products before use in order to remove residual water and additives that may become catalyst poisons in the subsequent step of polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement. In a preferred embodiment, the rubber cement is prepared in situ by polymerizing one or more appropriate monomers into rubbery elastomers in an organic solvent within the same reactor that is subsequently used for polymerizing 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. As noted above, many methods of synthesizing the above-mentioned rubbery elastomers are well known in the art. Preferably, however, the catalyst utilized in preparing the rubbery elastomers should not contain any ingredients that may become a catalyst poison in the subsequent step of polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement. Coordination catalyst systems, which are well known in the art, can be used for preparing the rubber cement of rubbery elastomers in situ. For example, lanthanide-based catalyst systems comprising a lanthanide compound such as a neodymium compound, an alkylating agent, and a source of halogen are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,297,667, 3,541,063, 3,794,604, which are incorporated herein by reference. These lanthanide-based catalyst systems are particularly useful for polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into cis-1,4-polybutadiene rubber. When a coordination catalyst such as the lanthanide-based system is used to synthesize rubbery elastomers, the catalyst is preferably inactivated by adding a terminator prior to proceeding with the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement. Suitable terminators include, but are not limited to, alcohols, carboxylic acids, inorganic acids, water, and mixtures thereof. It is not always necessary, however, to add a terminator to inactivate the catalyst system used to synthesize the rubbery elastomers since it is believed that the catalyst may be inactivated by the hydrogen phosphite component of the iron-based catalyst composition that is subsequently used to synthesize the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. This has been found to be true in the case where a coordination catalyst that includes a neodymium compound, an alkylating agent, and a source of halogen ion is used to synthesize the rubbery elastomers. Also, anionic polymerization initiators, which are well known in the art, can be used for preparing the rubber cement of rubbery elastomers in situ. These initiators include, but are not limited to, organolithium initiators such as butyllithium or functional initiators such as lithium amide initiators, aminoalkyl lithium initiators, and organotin lithium initiators. Exemplary initiators are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,153,159, 5,268,439, 5,274,106, 5,238,893, 5,332,810, 5,329,005, 5,578,542, 5,393,721, 5,491,230, 5,521,309, 5,496,940, 5,574,109, 5,523,364, 5,527,753, and 5,550,203. These initiators are particularly useful for synthesizing conjugated diene elastomers or copolymers of conjugated diene monomers and vinyl-substituted aromatic monomers. When an anionic initiator is used to prepare the rubbery elastomers, it is preferred to quench the polymerization by adding a terminator prior to proceeding with the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement. Suitable terminators include, but are not limited to, metal halides, organic halides, alcohols, carboxylic acids, inorganic acids, sulfonic acid, water, and mixtures thereof. Metal halides, such as diethylaluminum chloride and ethylaluminum dichloride, are preferred, as are organic halides such as trimethylsilylchloride. Failure to quench the anionic polymerization may interfere with the formation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Other methods that are useful for synthesizing rubbery elastomers are known in the art, and the practice of this invention should not be limited to the selection of any particular elastomer, or to any particular method for synthesizing rubbery elastomers. Suitable monomers that can be polymerized to form the rubbery elastomers include conjugated diene monomers. Vinyl-substituted aromatic monomers can be copolymerized with one or more conjugated diene monomers to form rubbery elastomers. Some specific examples of suitable conjugated diene monomers that can be polymerized into rubbery elastomers include 1,3-butadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, 2-phenyl-1,3-butadiene, isoprene, 1,3-pentadiene, 2-methyl-1,3-pentadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-pentadiene, and 4,5-diethyl-1,3-octadiene. Some specific examples of suitable vinyl-substituted aromatic monomers that can be polymerized into rubbery elastomers include styrene, 4-methylstyrene, Î±-methylstyrene, 3,5-diethylstyrene, 4-propylstyrene, 2,4,6-trimethylstyrene, 4-dodecylstyrene, 2,3,4,5-tetraethylstyrene, 3-methyl-5-normal-hexylstyrene, 4-phenylstyrene, 2-ethyl-4-benzylstyrene, 3,5-diphenylstyrene, 1-vinylnaphthalene, 3-ethyl-1-vinylnaphthalene, 6-isopropyl-1-vinylnaphthalene, 6-cyclohexyl-1-vinylnapthalene, 7-dodecyl-2-vinylnaphthalene, and the like, and mixtures thereof. In preparing the rubber cement, it is normally desirable to select an organic solvent that is inert with respect to the catalyst systems that will be employed to synthesize the rubbery elastomers and the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Suitable types of organic solvents that can be utilized in preparing the rubber cement include, but are not limited to, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, and aromatic hydrocarbons. Some representative examples of suitable aliphatic solvents include n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, n-decane, isopentane, isohexanes, isoheptanes, isooctanes, 2,2-dimethylbutane, petroleum ether, kerosene, petroleum spirits, and the like. Some representative examples of suitable cycloaliphatic solvents include cyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane, methylcyclohexane, and the like. Some representative examples of suitable aromatic solvents include benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, diethylbenzene, mesitylene, and the like. Commercial mixtures of the above hydrocarbons may also be used. For environmental reasons, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic solvents are highly preferred. The concentration of the rubbery elastomers in the rubber cement varies depending on the types of the rubbery elastomers and organic solvent employed. It is generally preferred that the concentration of the rubbery elastomers be in a range of from about 5% to about 35% by weight of the rubber cement, more preferably from about 10% to 30% by weight of the rubber cement, and even more preferably from about 15% to about 25% by weight of the rubber cement. The foregoing rubber cement is then utilized as a polymerization medium for the stereospecific polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Thus, 1,3-butadiene monomer, an iron-based catalyst composition, and optionally additional organic solvent are added to the rubber cement. The order in which the 1,3-butadiene monomer, the iron-based catalyst composition, and the solvent are added to the rubber cement does not limit the scope of the invention, although it may be preferable to add the iron-based catalyst composition, or at least an ingredient thereof, prior to the addition of the 1,3-butadiene monomer. The amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer added to the rubber cement is contingent upon the proportion of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene desired in the resultant polymer blend. The additional organic solvent can be selected from the group of the organic solvents mentioned above for the preparation of the rubber cement, and may be the same as or different from the organic solvent used in preparing the rubber cement. It should be noted that the addition of 1,3-butadiene monomer to the rubber cement may not be required in the case where 1,3-butadiene monomer is employed to prepare the rubbery elastomers and the polymerization is stopped before all the 1,3-butadiene is consumed, thereby providing the remaining 1,3-butadiene monomer for synthesizing the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene without the need to add additional 1,3-butadiene monomer. The polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement is catalyzed by an iron-based catalyst composition that is described in co-pending patent applications U.S. Ser. No. 09/172,305 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,180,734 and 6,211,313, which are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference. Generally, these catalyst compositions are formed by combining (a) an iron-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organoaluminum compound. In addition to the three catalyst ingredients (a), (b), and (c), other organometallic compounds or Lewis bases that are known in the art can also be added, if desired. Various iron-containing compounds or mixtures thereof can be employed as ingredient (a) of the iron-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention. It is generally advantageous to employ iron-containing compounds that are soluble in a hydrocarbon solvent such as aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbon-insoluble iron-containing compounds, however, can be suspended in the polymerization medium to form the catalytically active species, and are therefore also useful. The iron atom in the iron-containing compounds can be in various oxidation states including, but not limited to, the 0, +2, +3, and +4 oxidation states. It is preferable to use divalent iron compounds (also called ferrous compounds), wherein the iron is in the +2 oxidation state, and trivalent iron compounds (also called ferric compounds), wherein the iron is in the +3 oxidation state.

Useful hydrogen phosphite compounds that can be employed as ingredient (b) of the iron-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention are either acyclic hydrogen phosphites, cyclic hydrogen phosphites, or mixtures thereof. In general, the acyclic hydrogen phosphites may be represented by the following keto-enol tautomeric structures: where R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, are mono-valent organic groups. Preferably, R1 and R2 are hydrocarbyl groups such as, but not limited to, alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, substituted cycloalkenyl, aryl, allyl, substituted aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, and alkynyl groups, with each group preferably containing from 1 carbon atom, or the appropriate minimum number of carbon atoms to form the group, up to 20 carbon atoms. These hydrocarbyl groups may contain heteroatoms such as, but not limited to, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus atoms. The acyclic hydrogen phosphites exist mainly as the keto tautomer (shown on the left), with the enol tautomer (shown on the right) being the minor species. The equilibrium constant for the above-mentioned tautomeric equilibrium is dependent upon factors such as the temperature, the types of R1 and R2 groups, the type of solvent, and the like. Both tautomers may be associated in dimeric, trimeric or oligomeric forms by hydrogen bonding. Either of the two tautomers or mixtures thereof can be employed as the ingredient (b) of the catalyst composition of this invention. Some representative and non-limiting examples of suitable acyclic hydrogen phosphites are dimethyl hydrogen phosphite, diethyl hydrogen phosphite, dibutyl hydrogen phosphite, dihexyl hydrogen phosphite, dioctyl hydrogen phosphite, didecyl hydrogen phosphite, didodecyl hydrogen phosphite, dioctadecyl hydrogen phosphite, bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) hydrogen phosphite, diisopropyl hydrogen phosphite, bis(3,3-dimethyl-2-butyl) hydrogen phosphite, bis(2,4-dimethyl-3-pentyl) hydrogen phosphite, di-t-butyl hydrogen phosphite, bis(2-ethylhexyl) hydrogen phosphite, dineopentyl hydrogen phosphite, bis(cyclopropylmethyl) hydrogen phosphite, bis(cyclobutylmethyl) hydrogen phosphite, bis(cyclopentylmethyl) hydrogen phosphite, bis(cyclohexylmethyl) hydrogen phosphite, dicyclobutyl hydrogen phosphite, dicyclopentyl hydrogen phosphite, dicyclohexyl hydrogen phosphite, dimethyl hydrogen phosphite, diphenyl hydrogen phosphite, dinaphthyl hydrogen phosphite, dibenzyl hydrogen phosphite, bis(1-naphthylmethyl) hydrogen phosphite, diallyl hydrogen phosphite, dimethallyl hydrogen phosphite, dicrotyl hydrogen phosphite, ethyl butyl hydrogen phosphite, methyl hexyl hydrogen phosphite, methyl neopentyl hydrogen phosphite, methyl phenyl hydrogen phosphite, methyl cyclohexyl hydrogen phosphite, methyl benzyl hydrogen phosphite, and the like. Mixtures of the above dihydrocarbyl hydrogen phosphites may also be utilized. In general, cyclic hydrogen phosphites contain a divalent organic group that bridges between the two oxygen atoms that are singly-bonded to the phosphorus atoms. These cyclic hydrogen phosphites may be represented by the following keto-enol tautomeric structures: where R3 is a divalent organic group. Preferably, R3 is a hydrocarbylene group such as, but not limited to, alkylene, cycloalkylene, substituted alkylene, substituted cycloalkylene, alkenylene, cycloalkenylene, substituted alkenylene, substituted cycloalkenylene, arylene, and substituted arylene groups, with each group preferably containing from 1 carbon atom, or the appropriate minimum number of carbon atoms to form the group, up to 20 carbon atoms. These hydrocarbylene groups may contain heteroatoms such as, but not limited to, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus atoms. The cyclic hydrogen phosphites exist mainly as the keto tautomer (shown on the left), with the enol tautomer (shown on the right) being the minor species. The equilibrium constant for the above-mentioned tautomeric equilibrium is dependent upon factors such as the temperature, the types of R3 group, the type of solvent, and the like. Both tautomers may be associated in dimeric, trimeric or oligomeric forms by hydrogen bonding. Either of the two tautomers or mixtures thereof can be employed as the ingredient (b) of the catalyst composition of this invention. The cyclic hydrogen phosphites may be synthesized by the transesterification reaction of an acyclic dihydrocarbyl hydrogen phosphite (usually dimethyl hydrogen phosphite or diethyl hydrogen phosphite) with an alkylene diol or an arylene diol. Procedures for this transesterification reaction are well known to those skilled in the art. Typically, the transesterification reaction is carried out by heating a mixture of an acyclic dihydrocarbyl hydrogen phosphite and an alkylene diol or an arylene diol. Subsequent distillation of the side-product alcohol (usually methanol or ethanol) that results from the transesterification reaction leaves the new-made cyclic hydrogen phosphite. Some specific examples of suitable cyclic alkylene hydrogen phosphites are 2-oxo-(2H)-5-butyl-5-ethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-5,5-dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-5-ethyl-5-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-5,5-diethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-5-methyl-5-propyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4-isopropyl-5,5-dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,6-dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4-propyl-5-ethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,5-dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, and the like. Mixtures of the above cyclic alkylene hydrogen phosphites may also be utilized. Some specific examples of suitable cyclic arylene hydrogen phosphites are 2-oxo-(2H)-4,5-benzo-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,5-(3\u2032-methylbenzo)-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,5-(4\u2032-methylbenzo)-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,5-(4\u2032-tert-butylbenzo)-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,5-naphthalo-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, and the like. Mixtures of the above cyclic arylene hydrogen phosphites may also be utilized. The iron-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention further comprises an organoaluminum compound, which has been designated as ingredient (c). As used herein, the term \u0093organoaluminum compound\u0094 refers to any aluminum compound containing at least one aluminum-carbon bond. It is generally advantageous to employ organoaluminum compounds that are soluble in a hydrocarbon solvent. A preferred class of organoaluminum compounds that can be utilized is represented by the general formula AlRnX3âˆ’n, where each R, which may be the same or different, is a mono-valent organic group that is attached to the aluminum atom via a carbon atom, where each X, which may be the same or different, is a hydrogen atom, a carboxylate group, an alkoxide group, or an aryloxide group, and where n is an integer of 1 to 3. Preferably, each R is a hydrocarbyl group such as, but not limited to, alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, substituted cycloalkenyl, aryl, allyl, substituted aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, and alkynyl groups, with each group preferably containing from 1 carbon atom, or the appropriate minimum number of carbon atoms to form the group, up to about 20 carbon atoms. These hydrocarbyl groups may contain heteroatoms such as, but not limited to, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus atoms. Preferably, each X is a carboxylate group, an alkoxide group, or an aryloxide group, with each group preferably containing from 1 carbon atom, or the appropriate minimum number of carbon atoms to form the group, up to about 20 carbon atoms. Thus, some suitable types of organoaluminum compounds that can be utilized include, but are not limited to, trihydrocarbylaluminum, dihydrocarbylaluminum hydride, hydrocarbylaluminum dihydride, dihydrocarbylaluminum carboxylate, hydrocarbylaluminum bis (carboxylate), dihydrocarbylaluminum alkoxide, hydrocarbylaluminum dialkoxide, dihydrocarbylaluminum aryloxide, hydrocarbylaluminum diaryloxide, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Trihydrocarbylaluminum compounds are generally preferred. Some specific examples of organoaluminum compounds that can be utilized include trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, tri-n-propylaluminum, triisopropylaluminum, tri-n-butylaluminum, tri-n-hexylaluminum, tri-n-octylaluminum, tricyclohexylaluminum, triphenylaluminum, tri-p-tolyl-aluminum, tribenzylaluminum, diethylphenylaluminum, diethyl-p-tolylaluminum, diethylbenzylaluminum, ethyldiphenylaluminum, ethyldi-p-tolylaluminum, ethyl-dibenzylaluminum, diethylaluminum hydride, di-n-propylaluminum hydride, diisopropylaluminum hydride, di-n-butylaluminum hydride, diisobutylaluminum hydride, di-n-octylaluminum hydride, diphenylaluminum hydride, di-p-tolyl-aluminum hydride, dibenzylaluminum hydride, phenylethylaluminum hydride, phenyl-n-propylaluminum hydride, phenylisopropylaluminum hydride, phenyl-n-butylaluminum hydride, phenylisobutylaluminum hydride, phenyl-n-octylaluminum hydride, p-tolylethylaluminum hydride, p-tolyl-n-propylaluminum hydride, p-tolylisopropylaluminum hydride, p-tolyl-n-butylaluminum hydride, p-tolyl-isobutylaluminum hydride, p-tolyl-n-octylaluminum hydride, benzylethylaluminum hydride, benzyl-n-propylaluminum hydride, benzylisopropylaluminum hydride, benzyl-n-butylaluminum hydride, benzylisobutylaluminum hydride, and benzyl-n-octylaluminum hydride, ethylaluminum dihydride, n-propylaluminum dihydride, isopropylaluminum dihydride, n-butylaluminum dihydride, isobutylaluminum dihydride, n-octylaluminum dihydride, dimethylaluminum hexanoate, diethylaluminum octoate, diisobutylaluminum 2-ethylhexanoate, dimethylaluminum neodecanoate, diethyl-aluminum stearate, diisobutylaluminum oleate, methylaluminum bis(hexanoate), ethylaluminum bis(octoate), isobutylaluminum bis(2-ethylhexanoate), methyl-aluminum bis(neodecanoate), ethylaluminum bis(stearate), isobutylaluminum bis(oleate), dimethylaluminum methoxide, diethylaluminum methoxide, diisobutyl-aluminum methoxide, dimethylaluminum ethoxide, diethylaluminum ethoxide, diisobutylaluminum ethoxide, dimethylaluminum phenoxide, diethylaluminum phenoxide, diisobutylaluminum phenoxide, methylaluminum dimethoxide, ethylaluminum dimethoxide, isobutylaluminum dimethoxide, methylaluminum diethoxide, ethylaluminum diethoxide, isobutylaluminum diethoxide, methyl-aluminum diphenoxide, ethylaluminum diphenoxide, isobutylaluminum diphenoxide, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Another class of organoaluminum compounds that can be utilized is aluminoxanes. Aluminoxanes are well known in the art and comprise oligomeric linear aluminoxanes that can be represented by the general formula: and oligomeric cyclic aluminoxanes that can be represented by the general formula: where x is an integer of 1 to about 100, preferably about 10 to about 50; y is an integer of 2 to about 100, preferably about 3 to about 20; and each R4, which may be the same or different, is a mono-valent organic group that is attached to the aluminum atom via a carbon atom. Preferably, each R4 is a hydrocarbyl group such as, but not limited to, alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, substituted cycloalkenyl, aryl, allyl, substituted aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, and alkynyl groups, with each group preferably containing from 1 carbon atoms, or the appropriate minimum number of carbon atoms to form these groups, up to about 20 carbon atoms. These hydrocarbyl groups may contain heteroatoms such as, but not limited to, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus atoms. It should be noted that the number of moles of the aluminoxane as used in this application refers to the number of moles of the aluminum atoms rather than the number of moles of the oligomeric aluminoxane molecules. This convention is commonly employed in the art of catalysis utilizing aluminoxanes. In general, aluminoxanes can be prepared by reacting trihydrocarbylaluminum compounds with water. This reaction can be performed according to known methods, such as (1) a method in which the trihydrocarbylaluminum compound is dissolved in an organic solvent and then contacted with water, (2) a method in which the trihydrocarbylaluminum compound is reacted with water of crystallization contained in, for example, metal salts, or water adsorbed in inorganic or organic compounds, and (3) a method in which the trihydrocarbylaluminum compound is added to the monomer or monomer solution that is to be oligomerized, and then water is added. Some specific examples of aluminoxane compounds that can be utilized include methylaluminoxane (MAO), modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), ethylaluminoxane, butylaluminoxane, isobutylaluminoxane, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Isobutylaluminoxane is particularly useful on the grounds of its availability and its solubility in aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon solvents. Modified methylaluminoxane can be formed by substituting about 20-80% of the methyl groups of methylaluminoxane with C2 to C12 hydrocarbyl groups, preferably with isobutyl groups, by using techniques known to those skilled in the art. The iron-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention has a very high catalytic activity for polymerizing 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene over a wide range of total catalyst concentrations and catalyst ingredient ratios. The polymers having the most desirable properties, however, are obtained within a narrower range of total catalyst concentrations and catalyst ingredient ratios. Further, it is believed that the three catalyst ingredients (a), (b), and (c) can interact to form an active catalyst species. Accordingly, the optimum concentration for any one catalyst ingredient is dependent upon the concentrations of the other catalyst ingredients. The molar ratio of the hydrogen phosphite to the iron-containing compound (P/Fe) can be varied from about 0.5:1 to about 50:1, more preferably from about 1:1 to about 25:1, and even more preferably from about 2:1 to about 10:1. The molar ratio of the organoaluminum compound to the iron-containing compound (Al/Fe) can be varied from about 1:1 to about 100:1, more preferably from about 3:1 to about 50:1, and even more preferably from about 5:1 to about 25:1. As discussed above, the iron-based catalyst composition utilized in the present invention is preferably formed by combining the three catalyst ingredients (a), (b), and (c). Although an active catalyst species is believed to result from this combination, the degree of interaction or reaction between the various ingredients or components is not known with any great degree of certainty. Therefore, it should be understood that the term \u0093catalyst composition\u0094 has been employed to encompass a simple mixture of the ingredients, a complex of the various ingredients that is caused by physical or chemical forces of attraction, a chemical reaction product of the ingredients, or a combination of the foregoing. The iron-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention can be formed by combining or mixing the catalyst ingredients or components by using, for example, one of the following methods. First, the catalyst composition may be formed in situ by adding the three catalyst ingredients to the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and 1,3-butadiene monomer in either a stepwise or simultaneous manner. When adding the catalyst ingredients in a stepwise manner, the sequence in which the ingredients are added is not critical. Preferably, however, the iron-containing compound is added first, followed by the hydrogen phosphite, and then followed by the organoaluminum compound. Second, the three catalyst ingredients may be pre-mixed outside the polymerization system at an appropriate temperature, which is generally from about âˆ’20Â° C. to about 80Â° C., and the resulting catalyst composition is then added to the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and 1,3-butadiene monomer. Third, the catalyst composition may be pre-formed in the presence of 1,3-butadiene monomer. That is, the three catalyst ingredients are pre-mixed in the presence of a small amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer at an appropriate temperature, which is generally from about âˆ’20Â° C. to about 80Â° C. The amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer that is used for the catalyst pre-forming can range from about 1 to about 500 moles per mole of the iron-containing compound, and preferably should be from about 4 to about 100 moles per mole of the iron-containing compound. The resulting catalyst composition is then added to the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and the remainder of the 1,3-butadiene monomer that is to be polymerized. Fourth, as a further variation, the catalyst composition can also be formed by using a two-stage procedure. The first stage involves combining the iron-containing compound and the organoaluminum compound in the presence of a small amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer at an appropriate temperature, which is generally from about âˆ’20Â° C. to about 80Â° C. In the second stage, the foregoing reaction mixture and the hydrogen phosphite are charged in either a stepwise or simultaneous manner to the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and the remainder of the 1,3-butadiene monomer that is to be polymerized. Fifth, an alternative two-stage procedure may also be employed. An iron-ligand complex is first formed by pre-combining the iron-containing compound and the hydrogen phosphite compound. Once formed, this iron-ligand complex is then combined with the organoaluminum compound to form the active catalyst species. The iron-ligand complex can be formed separately or in the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and the 1,3-butadiene monomer that is to be polymerized. This complexation reaction can be conducted at any convenient temperature at normal pressure, but for an increased rate of reaction, it is preferred to perform this reaction at room temperature or above. The time required for the formation of the iron-ligand complex is usually within the range of about 10 minutes to about 2 hours after mixing the iron-containing compound with the hydrogen phosphite compound. The temperature and time used for the formation of the iron-ligand complex will depend upon several variables including the particular starting materials and the solvent employed. Once formed, the iron-ligand complex can be used without isolation from the complexation reaction mixture. If desired, however, the iron-ligand complex may be isolated from the complexation reaction mixture before use. Sixth, the three catalyst ingredients may be added to the rubber cement prior to or simultaneously with the addition of 1,3-butadiene monomer. When a solution of the iron-based catalyst composition or one or more of the catalyst ingredients is prepared outside the polymerization system as set forth in the foregoing methods, an organic solvent or carrier is preferably employed. Useful solvents include hydrocarbon solvents such as aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons. Non-limiting examples of aromatic hydrocarbon solvents include benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, diethylbenzene, mesitylene, and the like. Non-limiting examples of aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents include n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, n-decane, isopentane, isohexanes, isopentanes, isooctanes, 2,2-dimethylbutane, petroleum ether, kerosene, petroleum spirits, and the like. And, non-limiting examples of cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon solvents include cyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane, methylcyclohexane, and the like. Commercial mixtures of the above hydrocarbons may also be used. For environmental reasons, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic solvents are highly preferred. The foregoing organic solvents may serve to dissolve the catalyst composition or ingredients, or the solvent may simply serve as a carrier in which the catalyst composition or ingredients may be suspended. The production of blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers according to this invention is accomplished by polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer within the rubber cement by using a catalytically effective amount of the foregoing iron-based catalyst composition. To understand what is meant by a catalytically effective amount, it should be understood that the total catalyst concentration to be employed in the polymerization mass depends on the interplay of various factors such as the purity of the ingredients, the polymerization temperature, the polymerization rate and conversion desired, and many other factors. Accordingly, a specific total catalyst concentration cannot be definitively set forth except to say that catalytically effective amounts of the respective catalyst ingredients should be used. Generally, the amount of the iron-containing compound used can be varied from about 0.01 to about 2 mmol per 100 g of 1,3-butadiene monomer, with a more preferred range being from about 0.02 to about 1.0 mmol per 100 g of 1,3-butadiene monomer, and a most preferred range being from about 0.05 to about 0.5 mmol per 100 g of 1,3-butadiene monomer. In performing the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement, a molecular weight regulator may be employed to control the molecular weight of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to be produced. As a result, the scope of the polymerization system can be expanded in such a manner that it can be used for the production of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene having a wide range of molecular weights. Suitable types of molecular weight regulators that can be utilized include, but are not limited to, Î±-olefins such as ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, and 1-octene; accumulated diolefins such as allene and 1,2-butadiene; nonconjugated diolefins such as 1,6-octadiene, 5-methyl-1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene, 3,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, 4-vinylcyclohexene, 1,4-pentadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-hexadiene, 1,6-heptadiene, 1,2-divinylcyclohexane, 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene, 5-methylene-2-norbornene, 5-vinyl-2-norbornene, dicyclopentadiene, and 1,2,4-trivinylcyclohexane; acetylenes such as acetylene, methylacetylene and vinylacetylene; and mixtures thereof. The amount of the molecular weight regulator used, expressed in parts per hundred parts by weight of the 1,3-butadiene monomer (phm), is from about 0.01 to about 10 phm, preferably from about 0.02 to about 2 phm, and more preferably from about 0.05 to about 1 phm. The molecular weight of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to be produced can also be effectively controlled by conducting the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer in the presence of hydrogen gas. In this case, the partial pressure of hydrogen gas is preferably from about 0.01 to about 50 atmospheres. The polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement may be carried out as a batch process, a continuous process, or even a semi-continuous process. In the semi-continuous process, 1,3-butadiene monomer is intermittently charged as needed to replace that monomer already polymerized. In any case, the polymerization is desirably conducted under anaerobic conditions by using an inert protective gas such as nitrogen, argon or helium, with moderate to vigorous agitation. The polymerization temperature may vary widely from a low temperature, such as âˆ’10Â° C. or below, to a high temperature such as 100Â° C. or above, with a preferred temperature range being from about 20Â° C. to about 90Â° C. The heat of polymerization may be removed by external cooling, cooling by evaporation of the 1,3-butadiene monomer or the solvent, or a combination of the two methods. Although the polymerization pressure employed may vary widely, a preferred pressure range is from about 1 atmosphere to about 10 atmospheres. Once a desired conversion is achieved, the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement can be stopped by adding a polymerization terminator that inactivates the iron-based catalyst system. Typically, the terminator employed to inactivate the catalyst system is a protic compound, which includes, but is not limited to, an alcohol, a carboxylic acid, an inorganic acid, water, or a combination thereof. An antioxidant such as 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol may be added along with, before or after the addition of the terminator. The amount of the antioxidant employed is usually in the range of 0.2% to 1% by weight of the polymer product. When the polymerization reaction has been stopped, the blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and the rubbery elastomer can be recovered from the polymerization mixture by utilizing conventional procedures of desolventization and drying. For instance, the blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and the rubbery elastomer may be isolated from the polymerization mixture by coagulation of the polymerization mixture with an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol, or by steam distillation of the solvent and the unreacted 1,3-butadiene monomer, followed by filtration. The product is then dried to remove residual amounts of solvent and water. The polymer blend produced is a highly dispersed blend of crystalline syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in the rubbery elastomer. Advantageously, the iron-based catalyst composition employed in this invention can be manipulated to vary the characteristics of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in the polymer blend. Namely, the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in the polymer blend made by the process of this invention can have various melting temperatures, molecular weights, 1,2-linkage contents, and syndiotacticities, all of which are dependent upon selection of the catalyst ingredients and the ingredient ratios. For example, it has been found that the melting temperature, molecular weight, 1,2-linkage content, and syndiotacticity of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene can be increased by using an organoaluminum compound containing sterically bulky organic groups. Non-limiting examples of these sterically bulky organic groups include isopropyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, cyclohexyl, and 2,6-dimethylphenyl groups. The use of acyclic hydrogen phosphites in lieu of cyclic hydrogen phosphites will also increase the melting temperature, molecular weight, 1,2-linkage content, and syndiotacticity of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Manipulation of the characteristics of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene by varying catalyst ingredients and ratios is described in greater detail in co-pending applications U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/172,305, 09/173,956, and 09/439,861. The blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers produced with the process of this invention have many uses. For example, these blends can be utilized in rubber compositions that are used to manufacture the supporting carcass, innerliner, and tread of tires. The blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers are also useful in the manufacture of films and packaging materials and in many molding applications. In order to demonstrate the practice of the present invention, the following examples have been prepared and tested as described in the Examples disclosed hereinbelow. The examples should not, however, be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. The claims will serve to define the invention. EXAMPLES Example 1 In this experiment, a highly dispersed blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and low-vinyl polybutadiene was prepared by polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a low-vinyl polybutadiene rubber cement. The low-vinyl polybutadiene rubber cement was prepared by charging 449 g of hexanes, 911 g of a 1,3-butadiene/hexanes blend containing 22.4% by weight of 1,3-butadiene, and 0.64 mL of 1.60 M n-butyllithium in hexanes to a two-gallon stainless-steel reactor. The polymerization was carried out at 65Â° C. for 6 hours. The catalyst was inactivated by the addition of 1.02 mL of 1.0 M diethylaluminum chloride. The conversion of the 1,3-butadiene monomer to low-vinyl polybutadiene was determined to be essentially 100% by measuring the weight of the polymer recovered from a small portion of the rubber cement. After the low-vinyl polybutadiene rubber cement produced above was cooled to room temperature, 1048 g of hexanes and 2126 g of a 1,3-butadiene/hexanes blend containing 22.4% by weight of 1,3-butadiene were added to the rubber cement. The polymerization of the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was initiated by the addition of 20.0 mL of 0.0595 M iron(III) 2-ethylhexanoate in hexanes, 17.9 mL of 0.266 M bis(2-ethylhexyl) hydrogen phosphite in hexanes, and 28.0 mL of 0.68 M of triisobutylaluminum in hexanes. The polymerization was conducted at 65Â° C. for 4 hours. The polymerization was stopped by the addition of 3 mL of isopropanol diluted with 50 mL of hexanes. The polymerization mixture was added to 10 liters of isopropanol containing 12 g of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. The resulting blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and low-vinyl polybutadiene was isolated by filtration and dried to a constant weight under vacuum at 60Â° C. The yield of the polymer blend was 647 g. The conversion of the 1,3-butadiene monomer to the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was calculated to be 93%. As determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the polymer blend had a glass transition temperature of âˆ’93Â° C. resulting from the low-vinyl polybutadiene and a melting temperature of 183Â° C. resulting from the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Example 2 In this experiment, the procedure of Example 1 was repeated, except that the polymerization of the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the low-vinyl polybutadiene rubber cement was initiated by the addition of 32.0 mL of 0.0595 M iron(III) 2-ethylhexanoate in hexanes, 39.5 mL of 0.193 M 2-oxo-(2H)-5-butyl-5-ethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane in cyclohexane, and 39.2 mL of 0.68 M of triisobutylaluminum in hexanes. After work-up of the polymerization mixture, a highly dispersed blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and low-vinyl polybutadiene was obtained. The yield of the polymer blend was 623 g. The conversion of the 1,3-butadiene monomer to the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was calculated to be 88%. As determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the polymer blend had a glass transition temperature of âˆ’93Â° C. resulting from the low-vinyl polybutadiene, and a melting temperature of 155Â° C. resulting from the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Example 3 In this experiment, a highly dispersed blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and high cis-1,4-polybutadiene was prepared by polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a high cis-1,4-polybutadiene rubber cement. The high cis-1,4-polybutadiene rubber cement was prepared by charging 449 g of hexanes, 911 g of a 1,3-butadiene/hexanes blend containing 22.4% by weight of 1,3-butadiene, 9.0 mL of 0.68 M triisobutylaluminum in hexanes, 0.41 mL of 1.0 M diethylaluminum chloride, and 0.39 mL of 0.520 M neodymium(III) neodecanoate in cyclohexane to a two-gallon stainless-steel reactor. The polymerization was carried out at 80Â° C. for 5 hours. The conversion of the 1,3-butadiene monomer to high cis-1,4-polybutadiene was determined to be 96% by measuring the weight of the polymer recovered from a small portion of the rubber cement. After the high cis-1,4-polybutadiene rubber cement produced above was cooled to room temperature, 1048 g of hexanes and 2126 g of a 1,3-butadiene/hexanes blend containing 22.4% by weight of 1,3-butadiene were added to the rubber cement. The polymerization of the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was initiated by the addition of 16.0 mL of 0.0595 M iron(III) 2-ethylhexanoate in hexanes, 14.3 mL of 0.266 M bis(2-ethylhexyl) hydrogen phosphite in hexanes, and 21.0 mL of 0.68 M of triisobutylaluminum in hexanes. The polymerization was conducted at 65Â° C. for 4 hours. The polymerization was stopped by the addition of 3 mL of isopropanol diluted with 50 mL of hexanes. The polymerization mixture was added to 10 liters of isopropanol containing 12 g of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. The resulting blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and high cis-1,4-polybutadiene was isolated by filtration and dried to a constant weight under vacuum at 60Â° C. The yield of the polymer blend was 651 g. The conversion of the 1,3-butadiene monomer to the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was calculated to be 94%. As determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the polymer blend had a glass transition temperature of âˆ’103Â° C. and a melting temperature of âˆ’8Â° C. resulting from the high cis-1,4-polybutadiene, and a melting temperature of 184Â° C. resulting from the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Example 4 In this experiment, the procedure of Example 3 was repeated except that the polymerization of the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the high cis-1,4-polybutadiene rubber cement was initiated by the addition of 32.0 mL of 0.0595 M iron(III) 2-ethylhexanoate in hexanes,39.5 mL of 0.193 M 2-oxo-(2H)-5-butyl-5-ethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane in cyclohexane, and 39.2 mL of 0.68 M of triisobutylaluminum in hexanes. After work-up of the polymerization mixture, a highly dispersed blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and high cis-1,4-polybutadiene was obtained. The yield of the polymer blend was 637 g. The conversion of the 1,3-butadiene monomer to the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was calculated to be 91%. As determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the polymer blend had a glass transition temperature of âˆ’104Â° C. and a melting temperature of âˆ’7Â° C. resulting from the high cis-1,4-polybutadiene, and a melting temperature of 157Â° C. resulting from the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. In Examples 1-4, after the polymer blend cement was removed from the reactor, visual inspection of the interior of the reactor revealed that the reactor was relatively clean with minimal fouling. Comparative Example 5 In this experiment, the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was conducted in the absence of a rubber cement. In the procedure used, a two-gallon stainless-steel reactor was charged with 2408 g of hexanes, 2126 g of a 1,3-butadiene/hexanes blend containing 22.4% by weight of 1,3-butadiene, 16.0 mL of 0.0595 M iron(III) 2-ethylhexanoate in hexanes, 14.3 mL of 0.266 M bis(2-ethylhexyl) hydrogen phosphite in hexanes, and 21.0 mL of 0.68 M of triisobutylaluminum in hexanes. The polymerization was conducted at 65Â° C. for 4 hours. The polymerization was stopped by the addition of 3 mL of isopropanol diluted with 50 mL of hexanes. The polymerization mixture was removed from the reactor and added to 10 liters of isopropanol containing 12 g of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. Visual inspection of the interior of the reactor revealed that severe reactor fouling had occurred. In articular, the blades and shafts of the agitator were covered with chunks of agglomerated polymer particles, and the reactor wall was coated with a thick polymer film. Due to reactor fouling, the reactor had to be opened to recover the remaining polymer inside the reactor. The total yield of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene that was recovered was 457 g (96%). As determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the polymer had a melting temperature of 186Â° C. This comparative experiment showed that reactor fouling can be a serious problem in the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in the absence of a rubber cement. Examples 1-4 show that by utilizing the process of the present invention, the problem of reactor fouling associated with the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene can be greatly reduced. Although the present invention has been described in the above examples with reference to particular means, materials and embodiments, it would be obvious to persons skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made, which fall within the scope claimed for the invention as set out in the appended claims. The invention is therefore not limited to the particulars disclosed and extends to all equivalents within the scope of the claims."

        "text": "Description FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to a process for producing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene with a catalyst system which comprises a chromium-containing compound, an organoaluminum hydride, and a hydrogen phosphite. Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene exhibits properties of both plastics and rubber. It can be blended into rubbers and due to its residual carbon-carbon unsaturation it can be cocured with unsaturated rubbers. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene can be made by solution, emulsion or suspension polymerization. The syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene from solution, emulsion, or suspension polymerization typically has a melting temperature which is within the range of about 195Â° C. to 215Â° C. Various transition metal catalyst systems based on cobalt, titanium, vanadium, chromium, and molybdenum have been reported in the prior art for the preparation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene (see, e.g., L. Porri and A. Giarrusso, in Comprehensive Polymer Science, edited by G. C. Eastmond, A. Ledwith, S. Russo and P. Sigwalt, Pergamon Press: Oxford, 1989, Volume 4, Page 53). However, the majority of these catalyst systems have no practical utility because they have low catalytic activity or poor stereoselectivity and in some cases produce low molecular weight polymers or crosslinked polymers unsuitable for commercial use. The following cobalt-based catalyst systems are well known for the preparation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene: (1) cobalt bis(acetylacetonate)/triethyl aluminum/water/triphenyl phosphine (U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,498,963 and 4,182,813; Jap. Kokoku 44-32426, assigned to Japan Synthetic Rubber Co. Ltd.), and (2) cobalt tris(acetylacetonate)/triethyl aluminum/carbon disulfide (U.S. Pat. No. 3,778,424; Jap. Kokoku 72-19,892, 81-18,127, 74-17,666, and 74-17,667; Jap. Kokai 81-88,408, 81-88,409, 81-88,410, 75-59,480, 75-121,380, and 75-121,379, assigned to Ube Industries Ltd.). These two catalyst systems also have serious disadvantages. The cobalt bis(acetylacetonate)/triethyl aluminum/water/triphenyl phosphine system yields syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene having very low crystallinity. In addition, this catalyst system develops sufficient catalytic activity only in halogenated hydrocarbon solvents as the polymerization medium, and halogenated solvents present the problems of toxicity. The cobalt tris(acetylacetonate)/triethyl aluminum/carbon disulfide system uses carbon disulfide as one of the catalyst components. Because of its high volatility, obnoxious smell, low flash point as well as toxicity, carbon disulfide is difficult and dangerous to use and requires expensive safety measures to prevent even minimal amounts escaping into the atmosphere. Furthermore, the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene produced with this catalyst system has a very high melting temperature within the range of 200-210Â° C., which makes it difficult to process the polymer. Although the melting temperature of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene can be reduced by the use of a catalyst modifier as a fourth catalyst component, the presence of such a catalyst modifier also has an adverse effect on the catalyst activity and polymer yields. Accordingly, many restrictions are required for the industrial utilization of the two aforesaid cobalt-based catalyst systems of the prior art. Coordination catalyst systems based on chromium-containing compounds such as chromium(III) acetylacetonate/triethylaluminum have been known for a long time, but they have low catalytic activity and poor stereoselectivity for the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene and give rise to oligomers, low molecular weight liquid polymers or crosslinked polymers. Therefore, these chromium-based catalyst systems of the prior art have no industrial utility. Japanese patents JP-A-7306939 and JP-A-7364178, both assigned to Mitsubishi, disclose a process for polymerization of 1,3-butadiene to amorphous 1,2-polybutadiene by using a ternary catalyst system comprising: (a) a soluble chromium(III) compound, (b) a trialkyl aluminum compound, and (c) a dialkyl hydrogen phosphite. The product was reported to be a white rubbery polymer which contained a portion of gel and displayed no obvious melting point. U.S. Pat. No. 4,751,275, assigned to Bayer, discloses a process for the preparation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene by solution polymerization of 1,3-butadiene in a hydrocarbon polymerization medium. The catalyst system used in this solution polymerization contains a hydrocarbon-soluble chromium(III) compound, a trialkylaluminum compound, and dineopentyl hydrogen phosphite or methyl neopentyl hydrogen phosphite. However, the polymerization product was not well characterized as neither the melting temperature nor the degree of syndiotacticity of the product is reported. U.S. Pat. No. 4,168,357 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,168,374, both assigned to Goodyear, describe a similar chromium-based catalyst system for the preparation of high cis-1,4-polypentadiene. They disclose dialkylaluminum hydrides for preparing high cis-1,4-polypentadiene, e.g. in column 2, lines 44-52 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,168,357, but they do not claim dialkylaluminum hydrides as part of their catalyst system in the claims. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an improved process for polymerization of 1,3-butadiene to syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene using a catalyst system comprising: (a) a chromium-containing compound, (b) an organoaluminum hydride compound, and (c) a hydrogen phosphite. While chromium-based catalyst systems are known, the use in combination with organoaluminum hydride and hydrogen phosphite to yield syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was not known. The catalyst system of the present invention is operational under a variety of conditions (e.g. with or without solvents, over broad temperature range, and with a variety of molecular weight regulators). The use of the catalyst system avoids the use of environmentally detrimental components such as the carbon disulfide and halogenated solvents used in prior art catalysts. The use of the catalyst system of this disclosure also offers an alternative lower melting temperature syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene which can be mixed with rubber at lower temperatures than the 195-215Â° C. melting temperature typical of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene made by prior art catalyst systems. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention teaches a process for producing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene by polymerizing 1,3-butadiene in the presence of a catalyst system comprising: (a) a chromium-containing compound, (b) an organoaluminum hydride compound, and (c) a hydrogen phosphite.

The component (b) of the catalyst system of the present invention is an organoaluminum hydride compound. As used herein, the term \"organoaluminum hydride compound\" refers to any aluminum compound containing at least one covalent aluminum-carbon bond and at least one covalent aluminum-hydrogen bond. It is generally advantageous to employ organoaluminum hydride compounds that are soluble in the hydrocarbon polymerization medium.

Mixtures of the above organoaluminum hydride compounds may also be utilized. The catalyst system of the present invention further comprises a hydrogen phosphite as the component (c). The hydrogen phosphite can be either an acyclic dihydrocarbyl hydrogen phosphite or a cyclic hydrocarbylene hydrogen phosphite. The acyclic dihydrocarbyl hydrogen phosphite employed in the catalyst system of the present invention may be represented by the following keto-enol tautomeric structures: ##STR1## Wherein R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, are hydrocarbyl radicals selected from the group consisting of alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, and allyl groups; each group preferably containing from 1, or the appropriate minimum number of carbon atoms (e.g. 3 or 6) to form such group, up to 20 carbon atoms.

Either of the two tautomers or mixtures thereof can be used as the component (c) of the catalyst system of the present invention. The equilibrium constant for the above-mentioned tautomeric equilibrium is dependent upon such factors as the temperature, the types of R1 and R2 groups, the type of solvent, and the like.

Either of the two tautomers or mixtures thereof can be used as the component (c) of the catalyst system of the present invention. The equilibrium constant for the above-mentioned tautomeric equilibrium is dependent upon such factors as the temperature, the types of R3 group, the type of solvent, and the like.

Mixtures of the above cyclic arylene hydrogen phosphites may also be utilized. The catalyst system of the present invention contains the above-described three components (a), (b), and (c) as the main components. In addition to the three catalyst components (a), (b), and (c), other catalyst components such as other organometallic compounds, which are known in the art, can also be added, if desired. The catalyst system of the present invention has very high catalytic activity over a wide range of total catalyst concentrations and catalyst component ratios. The three catalyst components (a), (b), and (c) apparently interact to form the active catalyst species. Accordingly, the optimum concentration for any one catalyst component is dependent upon the concentrations of the other two catalyst components. While polymerization will occur over a wide range of catalyst concentrations and catalyst component ratios, the polymers having the most desirable properties are obtained within a narrower range of catalyst concentrations and catalyst component ratios. The molar ratio of the organoaluminum hydride compound to the chromium-containing compound (Al/Cr) in the catalyst system of the present invention can be varied from about 1:1 to about 100:1. However, a more preferred range of Al/Cr molar ratio is from about 3:1 to about 50:1, and a most preferred range is from about 5:1 to about 20:1. The molar ratio of the hydrogen phosphite to the chromium-containing compound (P/Cr) can be varied from about 0.5:1 to about 50:1, with a more preferred range of P/Cr molar ratio being from about 1:1 to about 25:1 and a most preferred range being from about 2:1 to about 10:1. The total catalyst concentration in the polymerization mass depends on such factors as the purity of the components, the polymerization rate and conversion desired, the polymerization temperature, and the like. Accordingly, specific total catalyst concentrations cannot be definitively set forth except to say that catalytically effective amounts of the respective catalyst components should be used. Generally, the amount of the chromium-containing compound used can be varied from about 0.01 to about 2 mmol per 100 g of 1,3-butadiene, with a more preferred range being from about 0.02 to about 1.0 mmol per 100 g of 1,3-butadiene and a most preferred range being from about 0.1 to about 0.5 mmol per 100 g of 1,3-butadiene. Certain specific total catalyst concentrations and catalyst component ratios that produce polymers having desired properties will be illustrated in the examples given to explain the teachings of the present invention. The three catalyst components of this invention may be introduced into the polymerization system in several different ways. Thus, the catalyst may be formed in situ by adding the three catalyst components to the monomer/solvent mixture in either a stepwise or simultaneous manner; the sequence in which the components are added in a stepwise manner is not critical but the components are preferably added in the sequence of the organoaluminum hydride compound, the chromium-containing compound, and finally the hydrogen phosphite. Alternatively, the three catalyst components may also be premixed outside the polymerization system at an appropriate temperature (e.g., from about -20Â° C. to about 80Â° C.), and the resulting mixture then added to the polymerization system. Additionally, the catalyst may also be preformed, that is, the three catalyst components are premixed in the presence of a small amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer at an appropriate temperature (e.g., from about -20Â° C. to about 80Â° C.), prior to being charged to the main portion of the monomer/solvent mixture that is to be polymerized. The amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer which may be used during the preforming of the catalyst can range from about 1 to about 500 moles per mole of the chromium-containing compound, and preferably should be from about 4 to about 50 moles per mole of the chromium-containing compound. In addition, the three catalyst components may also be introduced to the polymerization system using a two-stage procedure. This procedure involves first reacting the chromium-containing compound with the organoaluminum hydride compound in the presence of a small amount, as specified above, of 1,3-butadiene monomer at an appropriate temperature (e.g., from about -20Â° C. to about 80Â° C.). The resultant reaction mixture and the hydrogen phosphite are then added to the main portion of the monomer/solvent mixture in either a stepwise or simultaneous manner. Further, an alternative two-stage procedure may also be employed. This involves first reacting the chromium-containing compound with the hydrogen phosphite at an appropriate temperature (e.g., from about -20Â° C. to about 80Â° C.) to form a chromium complex, followed by adding the resultant chromium complex and the organoaluminum hydride compound to the monomer/solvent mixture in either a stepwise or simultaneous manner. When a catalyst solution is prepared outside the polymerization system, the organic solvent usable for the catalyst component solution may be selected from aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, and mixtures of two or more of the above-mentioned hydrocarbons. Preferably, the organic solvent consists of at least one selected from benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, heptane and cyclohexane. In accordance with the process of the present invention, the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer in the presence of the above-described chromium-based catalyst may be carried out by means of bulk polymerization, wherein no solvents are employed. Such bulk polymerization can be conducted either in a condensed liquid phase or in a gas phase. Alternatively and more typically, the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene according to the process of the present invention is carried out in an organic solvent as the diluent. In such cases, a solution polymerization system may be employed in which both the 1,3-butadiene monomer to be polymerized and the polymer formed are soluble in the polymerization medium. Alternatively, a suspension polymerization system may be employed by choosing a solvent in which the polymer formed is insoluble. In both cases, an amount of the organic solvent in addition to the organic solvent contained in the catalyst component solutions is usually added to the polymerization system. The additional organic solvent may be either the same as or different from the organic solvent contained in the catalyst component solutions. It is normally desirable to select an organic solvent that is inert with respect to the catalyst system employed to catalyze the polymerization reaction. Suitable types of organic solvents that can be utilized as the diluent include, but are not limited to, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, and aromatic hydrocarbons. Some representative examples of suitable aliphatic solvents include n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, n-decane, isopentane, isohexanes, isoheptanes, isooctanes, 2,2-dimethylbutane, petroleum ether, kerosene, petroleum spirits, and the like. Some representative examples of suitable cycloaliphatic solvents include cyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane, methylcyclohexane, and the like. Some representative examples of suitable aromatic solvents include benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, diethylbenzene, mesitylene, and the like. Commercial mixtures of the above hydrocarbons may also be used. For environmental reasons, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic solvents are highly preferred. The concentration of the 1,3-butadiene monomer to be polymerized is not limited to a special range. However, generally, it is preferable that the concentration of the 1,3-butadiene monomer present in the polymerization medium at the beginning of the polymerization be in a range of from about 3% to about 80% by weight, but a more preferred range is from about 5% to about 50% by weight, and the most preferred range is from about 10% to about 30% by weight. In performing the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene according to the process of the present invention, a molecular weight regulator may be employed to control the molecular weight of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to be produced. As a result, the scope of the polymerization system can be expanded in such a manner that it can be used for the production of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene ranging from an extremely high molecular weight polymer to a low molecular weight polymer. Suitable types of molecular weight regulators that can be utilized include, but are not limited to, accumulated diolefins such as allene and 1,2-butadiene; nonconjugated diolefins such as 1,6-octadiene, 5-methyl-1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene, 3,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, 4-vinylcyclohexene, 1,4-pentadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-hexadiene, 1,6-heptadiene, 1,2-divinylcyclohexane, 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene, 5-methylene-2-norbornene, 5-vinyl-2-norbornene, dicyclopentadiene, and 1,2,4-trivinylcyclohexane; acetylenes such as acetylene, methylacetylene and vinylacetylene; and mixtures thereof. The amount of the molecular weight regulator used, expressed in parts per hundred parts by weight of the 1,3-butadiene monomer (phm) employed in the polymerization, is in the range of about 0.01 to about 10 phm, preferably in the range of about 0.02 to about 2 phm, and most preferably in the range of about 0.05 to about 0.5 phm. In addition, the molecular weight of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene product to be obtained can also be effectively controlled by performing the polymerization of the 1,3-butadiene monomer in the presence of hydrogen. In this case, the partial pressure of hydrogen is appropriately chosen within the range of about 0.01 to about 50 atmospheres. In accordance with the process of the present invention, the polymerization 1,3-butadiene may be carried out as a batch process, on a semi-continuous basis, or on a continuous basis. In any case, the polymerization is conducted under anaerobic conditions using an inert protective gas such as nitrogen, argon or helium, with moderate to vigorous agitation. The polymerization temperature employed in the practice of this invention may vary widely from a low temperature, such as -10Â° C. or below, to a high temperature such as 100Â° C. or above, with a preferred temperature range being from about 20Â° C. to about 90Â° C. The heat of polymerization may be removed by external cooling, cooling by evaporation of the 1,3-butadiene monomer or the solvent, or a combination of the two methods. Although the polymerization pressure employed in the practice of this invention also may vary widely, a preferred pressure range is from about 1 atmosphere to about 10 atmospheres. The polymerization reaction of the present invention, on reaching a desired conversion, can be stopped by addition of a known polymerization terminator into the polymerization system to inactivate the catalyst system, followed by the conventional steps of desolventization and drying as are typically employed and are known to those skilled in the art in the production of conjugated diene polymers. Typically, the terminator employed to inactivate the catalyst system is a protic compound, which includes, but is not limited to, an alcohol, a carboxylic acid, an inorganic acid, and water or a combination thereof. An antioxidant such as 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol may be added along with, before or after addition of the terminator. The amount of the antioxidant employed is usually in the range of 0.2% to 1% by weight of the polymer product. When the polymerization reaction has been stopped, the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene product may be isolated from the polymerization mixture by precipitation with an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol or by steam distillation of the solvent and the unreacted 1,3-butadiene monomer, followed by filtration. The product is then dried under a constant vacuum at a temperature within the range of about 25Â° C. to about 100Â° C. (preferably at about 60Â° C.). The syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene product produced by the process of the present invention has a higher melting temperature and increased syndiotacticity over some of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene products produced by the chromium-based catalysts of the prior art. Desirable melting temperature for claiming purposes is from about 100 to about 140Â° C. and more desirably from about 102 or 105 to about 125 or 130Â° C. Desirable 1,2-linkage content for claiming purposes is from about 75, 80 or 83 to about 90 or 95% of the total repeat units. The syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene product produced by the process of the present invention has many uses. It can be blended with various rubbers in order to improve the properties thereof. For example, it can be incorporated into elastomers in order to improve the green strength of those elastomers, particularly in tires. The supporting carcass (reinforcing carcass) of tires is particularly prone to distortion during tire building and curing procedures. For this reason the incorporation of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene into rubber compositions, which are utilized in the supporting carcass of tires, has particular utility to prevent this distortion. In addition, the incorporation of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene into tire tread compositions can reduce the heat build-up and improve wear characteristics of tires. The syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene product is also useful in the manufacture of food films and in many molding applications. The practice of the present invention is further illustrated by reference to the following examples, which however, should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. Parts and percentages shown in the examples are by weight unless otherwise indicated. EXAMPLE 1 An oven-dried 1-liter glass bottle was capped with a self-sealing rubber liner and a perforated metal cap and purged with a stream of dry nitrogen. The bottle was charged with 245 g of a 1,3-butadiene/hexanes blend containing 20.4% by weight of 1,3-butadiene. The following catalyst components were added to the bottle in the following order: 0.50 mmol of diisobutylaluminum hydride, 0.050 mmol of chromium(III) 2-ethylhexanoate, and 0.20 mmol of bis(2-ethylhexyl) hydrogen phosphite. The bottle was tumbled for 4 hours in a water bath maintained at 50Â° C. The polymerization was terminated by addition of 10 ml of isopropanol containing 0.5 g of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. The polymerization mixture was added into 3 liters of isopropanol. The polymer was isolated by filtration and dried to a constant weight under vacuum at 60Â° C. The yield was 38.1 g (76%). As measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the polymer had a melting temperature of 105Â° C. 1 H and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of the polymer indicated a 1,2-linkage content of 81.1% and a syndiotacticity of 69.0%.

        "text": "Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a synthetic leather using, in a synthetic resin layer which is the base material of the synthetic leather, cross-linked foamed syndiotactic 1, 2-polybutadiene. The synthetic leather has favorable softness providing the touch and aesthetic properties of natural leather, undergoes low changes in flexibility within the temperature range of ordinary use, and having good elasticity. 2. Description of the Prior Art Most synthetic leathers have a multi-layered structure comprising a base fabric layer, an adhesive boundary layer, a resin layer and a top layer. In the resin layer, quasi-natural leathers such as foamed or unfoamed polyvinyl chloride, polyamides, polyurethanes, polyamino acids, etc. are conventionally used. Those which contain a base sheet comprising polyvinyl chloride are generally called vinyl leathers, and the foamed products thereof are called sponge leathers to discriminate them from oridinary synthetic leathers. Vinyl leathers have the practical advantages that they are comparatively inexpensive and can be produced with ease, and they enable one to obtain suitable physical properties for the artificial leather. Therefore, they are currently used in the largest amount neglecting various defects with respect to physical properties, i.e., since polyvinyl chloride is an essentially glassy and hard resin, a large amount of a plasticizer must be compounded therewith in order to convert it to a leather or like soft material. In particular, for high-grade leathers which require good softness through all seasons, dioctyl phthalate, di-n-octyl phthalate, dioctyl sebacate or like plasticizers are mainly compounded therewith. These plasticizers are partly vaporized away during production of the synthetic leather and cause the phenomenon of bleeding, migration, etc., thus being unavoidably released from the base material to come into contact with the human body. Such a release of plasticizer can be the cause of a reduction in flexural fatigue resistance at low temperatures in winter and blocking at high temperatures in summer. Recently, the harmful effects of many plasticizers have been suspected. From this viewpoint, there have been conducted various investigations of the use of foamed products of plasticizer-free high pressure process polyethylene or ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers containing vinyl acetate in high proportions. However, these are so poor in adhesive properties that adhesion to a base fabric layer or to a top layer is difficult. Further, they are inferior in softness. Thus, they have not yet replaced conventional vinyl leathers. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is one object of the present invention to provide a synthetic leather. A further object of the present invention is to provide a synthetic leather comprising cross-linked, foamed syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene as a main component. A yet further object of this invention is to provide a synthetic leather comprising one or more layers consisting of cross-linked, foamed syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene or a mixture of such 1,2-polybutadiene and another synthetic resin as a synthetic resin layer(s). A still further object of the present invention is to provide such a synthetic leather having favorable softness and providing a feel and aesthetic property similar to that of good natural leather, which undergoes low changes in flexibility at a temperature of ordinary use, and which has good elasticity. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Cross-linked syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene has none of the aforesaid difficulties of the prior art since it does not contain any plasticizer. In addition, it has extremely excellent softness and a gentle touch, as well as good flexibility, which highly resembles the feel of natural leather obtained by chrome tanning, and is completely different from conventional rubber sheets. Also, it has good adhesive properties, and adhesion to a base fabric or top-coating can be conducted with ease using a properly selected conventional adhesive agent or surface treating agent. In this case, cross-linking imparts a suitable solvent resistance. As an adhesive agent conventional ones belonging to natural rubbers, chloroprene rubbers, nitrile rubbers, butyl rubbers, urethane rubbers or epoxy resins can be used. The surface treating agents used in this invention should be such that they have substantially the same flexibility and elasticity as those of the cross-linked foamed syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and have adhesiveness, with urethanes, especially thermoplastic urethane, surface treating agent providing good results. The adhesive layer may be provided between the surface treating layer and a resin layer. The surface treating layer may also be coated in multi-layer form, if desired. For example, a surface treating agent belonging to polyamino acids, polyamides, polyvinyl chlorides or acrylic rubbers may be coated on the surface layer of a polyurethane in one or more layers to thereby prepare a synthetic leather having desired properties, e.g., various lusters, feel and the like. There can be also obtained a product with uniform and fine cells, which improve the abrasion resistance and scratch resistance of the surface. Th syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene of the present invention is a resin of excellent heat stability and molding properties, having comparatively high 1,2-bond content (about 70% or more), a comparatively high molecular weight (about 100,000 or more), and a comparatively low degree of crystallinity (about 10 to about 50%), and containing 20% or more of a syndiotactic stereospecific structure. The content of isomeric units (cis-1,4-, trans-1,4-, and 1,2-vinyl units) is determined by IR absorption spectra according to Morero's method (D. Morero, A. Santanbrogio, L. Porri, and F. Ciampelli: Chem. e. Ind., 41, 758 (1959)). The method proposed by Mochel is used to estimate the tacticity of 1,2-polybutadiene samples (V. D. Mochel: J. Polym. Sci., Part A-1, 10, 1009 (1972)). In general, 1,2-polybutadiene polymers can be classified into (1) liquid types having a low molecular weight; (2) completely amorphous ones having a rubbery property; (3) highly crystalline ones having poor heat stability and no workablility; and (4) low crystalline ones having a high molecular weight and good workability. Of these, type (1) requires increased molecular weight and cross-linking upon working, and continuous molding using an extruder or the like is difficult due to the liquid state thereof. Type (2) is so poor in heat fluidity that it is not suitable for processing in a general thermoplastic resin molding machine. With type (3), practical heat molding is difficult since the warking temperature almost coincides with the decomposition point. Type (4) is a thermorubber having a moldability similar to that of thermoplastic resin. The 1,2-polybutadiene thermoplastic is a solid having an adhesiveness insufficient to form pellets at room temperature and having, at a temperature above its softening point, a melt viscosity sufficient to form using a conventional molding apparatus. In order to make 1,2-polybutadiene a thermoplastic resin, the 1,2-polybutadiene should be a polymer which contains both a crystalline phase and rubber phase at room temperature due to the properties of the monomers used with the content of crystalline phase being lower than that of the rubber phase. For example, when the polymer consists of only the rubber phase it becomes a polymer belonging to type (2) above, and when it consists of a considerably high amount of crystalline phase, it becomes a type (3) polymer. Further, a polymer consisting only of 1,2-unit has not hitherto been obtained other than one having a relatively low molecular weight which is liquid because of difficulties encountered in polymerization. Therefore, in order to obtain a thermoplastic polymer, it is necessary that the resin contain some 1,4-bonds. There is a close inter-relationship between the 1,2-unit content, the stereoregular structure content and crystallinity. That is, in 1,2-polybutadiene which is a thermoplastic rubber, the content of syndiotactic configurations increases with the content of the 1,2-bonds. When the 1,2-bond content is considerably high (not less than about 70 mol %) and the syndiotactivity is also relatively high (not less than about 20 mol %), the crystallinity is relatively low (about 10 to about 50 mol %), thus providing a polymer having a molecular weight of not less than about 100,000 which can readily be processed as a thermoplastic rubber. This polymer is a 1,2-polybutadiene polymer employable in this invention. The 1,2-polybutadiene used in the present invention can be obtained according to methods described in Japanese Patent Publications No. 32425/1969, 32426/1969, 38070/1970, 30699/1971, 30700/1971, etc. For example, a solvent, butadiene and catalyst (e.g., cobalt bisacetylacetonate, triphenylphosphine, triethyl aluminum) are introduced into a glass tube in a proportion of Al/Co/P/butadiene = 430/178 /100,000 (molar ratio) and allowed to react at 10Â° C. for about 18 hours, followed by adding an aging inhibitor and then stopping the reaction to thereby obtain the desired 1,2-polybutadiene. From X-ray diffraction analysis, the vinyl units in the fine structure of the polymer are present in an amount of about 90% or more. Cross-linked foamed syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene product can generally be produced by cross-linking through a chemical cross-linking process using sulfur or an organic peroxide or a physical cross-linking by irradiation with gamma rays, electron beams or the like and then heating to a temperature higher than the decomposition point of a chemical foaming agent to foam the cross-linked product. As an original sheet for synthetic leather, physical properties and aesthetic properties particularly resembling those of natural leather are required, and hence foamed products obtained by the process and using the materials as described in U.S. Pat. Application Ser. No. 728,653 entitled \"Process For Producing Foamed Products,\" filed Oct. 1, 1976 in the names of Yasuo Shikinami, Ryuichi Kimura, Yoshinobu Yoshikawa, Kosuke Iida and Kunihiro Hata, hereby incorporated by reference, are said to be desirable. That is, a photosensitizer, a foaming agent and, if desired or necessary, an aging inhibitor, a colorant, or like additives are added to the above described 1,2-polybutadiene, and the mixture fed to an extruder or a like molding machine to form the same into a thin sheet at a temperature higher than the softening point of the resin and lower than the decomposition point of the foaming agent, and then the sheet is irradiated with ultraviolet rays for a short time to convert the resin to a resin having a three-dimensional structure (cross-linking), followed by heating to a higher temperature than the decomposition point of the foaming agent to foam and expand the cross-linked sheet, whereby foamed products are continuously obtained. The gel fraction of such products (refluxed for 7 hours in boiling toluene) is suitably about 30 to 80%. The thus obtained foamed product is of extremely excellent softness, scarcely undergoes changes in flexibility at temperatures of ordinary use, is particularly excellent in elasticity and smoothness, and well absorbs the energy as tensile, bending, deformation, etc. Accordingly, it follows the complicated shape of a coated substrate so accurately that it is particularly suitable as a synthetic leather for clothes. Also, it provides a gentle touch due to the vinyl groups in the side chains of the base resin, and has aesthetic properties extremely closely resembling high quality natural leather. Further, it provides a warm agreeable touch since it is a foamed product. Thus, it has many advantages. The thickness of the foamed product suitable as a resin layer for synthetic leather is about 0.3 to about 2.0 mm, preferably 0.5 to 1.5 mm (this thickness range applies only to the polybutadiene layer), and the expansion ratio ranges from about 3 to about 15 times (the bulk density being about 0.3 to about 0.05 g/cm3), preferably 5 to 10 times (the bulk density being 0.18 to 0.09 g/cm3), which renders it lighter than conventional sponge leathers. Adhesion to woven fabrics, knitted fabrics, non-woven fabrics, paper, natural or synthetic resin products, various resin films or like base fabric can be effected according to general processes by properly selecting an adhesive agent and a solvent. Examples of generally used substrates include staple fiber muslin, calico (unbleached muslin), cotton suede, various synthetic fabrics, tricot, polynosic, and single surface or both surface-raised-up cloths of these materials. Although the thickness of adhesive is not limited, generally used thicknesses are from about 5 to 50 g/m2. Further, a synthetic leather of better quality can be obtained by applying to a top coat (the top-coat thickness is usually from about 3 to about 50 gm/m2, although such is not limitative) a conventional surface treating agent of excellent scratch resistance, abrasion resistance, solvent resistance, heat resistance, weatherability, cold resistance, etc., such as polyurethane, polyamide, or polyamino acid surface treating agents for synthetic leather; the surface treating agents are not limited to any particular kind. The thus obtained synthetic leather can be used for various uses such as paper substitutes and linings for use in buildings, cars, etc., book covers, chair covers, tablecloth substitutes, carpets, foot wear such as sandals and slippers, bands for wrist watches and as a belt for clothing, sacks and bags, covers, and the like. Additionally, in some cases, the cross-linked foamed product prepared by mixing the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene of the present invention with low density polyethylene, an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (desirably the vinyl acetate content is not more than about 40 mol %) or another soft, i.e., flexible polyolefin copolymer having compatibility with the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene, e.g., an ethylene-propylene copolymer, an ethylene-acrylic acid ester copolymer, an ethylene-butadiene copolymer and the like, may be used. The aesthetic properties, softness, weatherability, solvent resistance and like physical properties of the product can be adjusted according to the kind of soft polyolefin and the compounding ratio thereof. Generally such polyolefins are used in an amount of about 10 to about 50% by weight based on the total weight of the product in view of the flexibility, adhesive properties, feel, etc., of the total weight of the 1,2-polybutadiene and the soft polyolefin. The present invention will be illustrated by several Examples. Unless otherwise indicated all parts and percentages used herein are by weight. EXAMPLE 1 Pellets, prepared by mixing 100 parts of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene (trade name: JSR, RB-810; made by Japan Synthetic Rubber Co., Ltd.) with 7.0 parts of azodicarbonamide, 1.0 part of p,p'-oxybis(benzenesulfonylhydrazide) and 0.5 part of benzophenone, were fed to an extruder and continuously extruded into a 0.4mm thick sheet. This sheet was then irradiated for 4 minutes with ultraviolet rays at a distance of 30 cm from both sides using 1 KW high pressure mercury lamp, and the foaming agent was decomposed at 210Â° C. to obtain a foamed sheet, followed by passing the sheet between hot rolls (about 50Â° to about 60Â° C.) to form a sheet having a smooth surface. There was thus obtained a foamed sheet of a specific gravity of 0.1 which was 1.2 mm in thickness having good surface properties and uniform, fine cells which was of extremely excellent flexibility and had aesthetic properties well resembling good natural leather. When this foamed sheet was subjected to the physical tests specified for polyvinyl chloride leather [blocking test (JISK-6772); flexing resistance test (1 kg Ã— 5000 times; Scott's process); cold flexing test (20,000 times at -10Â° C.)], it withstood all the tests. On the other hand, a chloroprene adhesive was thinly coated (30g/m2) on knitted fabric or non-woven fabric, and the foamed sheet was laminated thereon. Thereafter, an urethane surface treating agent (LU 1500, LU 3500 or LU 3560; made by Dainichiseika Colour & Chemical Mfg. Co., Ltd.) was coated thereon in a thickness of 15 to 30 g/m2 to form different samples, followed by drying. The thus obtained synthetic leather was extremely soft, and the flexibility thereof was hardly effected at temperatures of ordinary use (-20Â° to 45Â° C.), the leather showing no adhesive properties. When the base fabric was an elastic knitted fabric, the product was so elastic that it could be bent and stretched into complicated shapes. Foamed sheets of 0.3 to 2.0 mm in thickness and a 3 to 5 times expansion ratio were prepared in the same manner, and the same synthetic leathers obtained by adhering these sheets to base fabric and subjecting them to a surface treatment. EXAMPLE 2 Syndiotactic, 1,2-polybutadiene (the same as in Example 1) was respectively mixed with 10 to 50% of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (vinyl acetate content: not more than 40%) (trade name: Ultrathene made by Toyo Soda Manufacturing Co., Ltd.) or ethylene-propylene copolymer (melt index according to ASTM D1238: 0.25-9.0; density 0.88) (trade name: Tafmer; made by Mitsui Petrochemical Industries, Ltd.), and foamed products were obtained in the same manner as in Example 1, which were a little different in elasticity, softness and aesthetic properties. However, the same synthetic leathers as in Example 1 were obtained by properly selecting base fabric or a surface-treating agent. While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without department from the spirit and scope thereof."

Parris, Morris Plains, N.J., assignors to Allied Chemical Corporation, New York, N.Y. No Drawing. Filed June 11, 1969, Ser. No. 832,488 Int. Cl. C08f 27/00 US. Cl. 260-4535 4 Claims ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE v.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to isomerization of 1,2-polybutadiene having at least about 60% of its butadiene content combined in the 1,2 form. The subject isomerization when carried to its maximum, results in virtually complete elimination of vinyl groups from the polymer at least when the polymer has a high content of vinyl groups as in polymer having 90% or more of its butadiene content combined in the 1,2 form. The resulting polymers have a high level of stifiness and resistance to heat. The isomerized polymers obtained by the process of this invention, moreover, show about the same number average molecular weight, determined by osmometry, as the starting polymers; they are fully soluble in toluene; and they have greater melt viscosities than the starting polymers. Accordingly the isomerized polymers obtained by this invention are believed to be cyclized 1,2-polybutadiene having as the chain structure, a chain of fused cyclohexane rings. Cyclization of polybutadiene polymers containing pendant doubly bonded groups has been known for many years. However, the known cyclization procedures for 1,2-polybutadiene generally resulted in crosslinking, making the polymer product insoluble in the usual aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as benzene and toluene. To avoid cross-linking, in accordance with one proposal, polybutadienes having pendant doubly bonded groups are cylized, with the use of a cationic agent to promote the cyclization, at low concentration of polymer in benzene or a lower alkyl benzene solvent such as toluene (US. Pat. 3,245,974 of Apr. 12, 1966 to Angelo). The maximum concentration of polymer in the solvent, permissable in this patented procedure, is 1%. Such low concentration is undesirable economically because of the large volumes of solvent which must be handled and recovered. Specifically this patent teaches cyclization only of 3,4-polyisoprene and other substituted polybutadienes. Unsubstituted 1,2-polybutadiene polymers having at least 60% and up to substantially 100% of the butadiene content combined in the 1,2 form are known in the art, e.g. from Montecatini British Pats. 835,752 published May 25, 1960; and 854,615 published Nov. 23, 1960. The 1,2-polybutadiene content of such polymers is determined from infrared spectral data as known in the art. SUMMARY By this invention an improved process is provided for cyclization of 1,2-polybutadiene having at least 60% of its butadiene content combined in the 1,2 form, using a. \"United States Patent O cationic agent to promote the cyclization and using a lower alkyl benzene solvent as reaction medium. By the process of the invention, concentrations of the polymer in the solvent of about 5% by weight can readily be used. In accordance with this invention, the temperature employed during the cyclization reaction is limited to at most 105 C. and there is included in the 1,2-polybutadiene undergoing cyclization, an antioxidant such as a hindered polyphenol or other phenolic or aromatic amine antioxidant in proportion of at least 0.1% by weight on the polybutadiene. The concentration of polymer in solvent is in the range 3%-l0% by weight. Thereby within 10 hours of reaction time, upon precipitation from the solvent, a polymer product is obtained which is free of vinyl groups as indicated by infrared spectrum and is free of crosslinking as shown by its ready solubility in toluene at 25 C. At times short of giving maximum cyclization, polymers having progressively higher second order transition temperatures (as determined by stiffness measurements) are obtained, indicating that the structure is a chain of fused cyclohexane ring segments joined by 1,2-polybutadiene segments in these polymers. PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION To obtain the maximum benefits of this invention, it desirable to use 1,2-polybutadiene starting polymer having a high concentration of pendant vinyl groups, i.e. having at least of its butadiene content combined in the 1,2 dorm. Particular varieties of such high vinyl polybutadiene are the known syndiotactic polymers and atactic polymers. A particularly useful cationic agent for the purposes of this invention is boron trifiuoride, suitably in the form of its complex with diethyl ether, known as boron tritluoride et-herate. A concentration of at least 0.1% by weight as boron trifluoride should be employed in the reaction mixture; and preferably the agent is supplied in such concentration at intervals throughout the reaction period. A preferred solvent in view of its suitable boiling point and ready availability is toluene; also the various xylene isomers are suitable and also ethyl benzene. As stated above, the reaction temperature should not exceed 0., since it higher temperatures are used for appreciable periods, cross-linking of the polymer is likely. Too high a concentration of the polymer will also allow cross-linking, so that 10% by weight is considered a maximum. In order to obtain a satisfactorily rapid reaction the reaction temperature will in general be maintained at least at 90 C. To obtain the advantages of the invention in terms of using reduced volumes of solvent, the concentrations of polymer employed will ordinarily be at least 3% by weight. In. addition to temperature control, a very important feature of the invention is to include in the polybutadiene undergoing cyclization, an antioxidant capable of inhibiting cross-linking. Hindered polyphenol antioxidants are very suitable, such as bisphenols, trisphenols, etc. for example the 4,4'-bis-(tertiary-butyl-meta-cresols); and also antioxidants based on aromatic amines. The eifectiveness of antioxidants to inhibit cross-linking has been disclosed in the prior art. However it was quite unexpected that these materials would allow cyclization to proceed While effectively inhibiting cross-linking. In fact, in the prior art such antioxidants, when present in the starting polymer, have been removed e.g. by washing with acetone. To be effective, the antioxidant should be employed in amount of at least 0.1% by weight. Larger amounts can be used, but in general the amount used will not exceed about 10% by weight. 3 EXAMPLES The examples which follow are illustrative of the invention and the best mode contemplated at present for carrying out the invention; but the invention is not to be considered as limited to all details of the examples. (A) Definitions and tests (1) Molecular weight, M, is determined from intrinsic viscosity, 1 in toluene at 25 C. by the formula: where the units of 1; are dL/gm. (see Ind. Eng. Chem. Vol. 44 of 1952, pages 752756article by Bernard L. Johnson and R. D. Wolfangel). (2) Physical properties were measured on compression molded test bars using the following ASTM test methods: (a) Flexural properties D-790 (b) Tensile properties D-638 (c) Izod impact D-256 The samples were compressed to a preform, then heated in the press for 2 minutes at 180 C., then pressurized 6 minutes at 220 C.; then cooled. (3) T is a measure of stiffness in relation to temperature, given by the temperature at which torsional modulus (Gehman method) has the value: 333x10 dynes per sq. cm. (B) Starting polymers 1) Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene having molecular weight of about 80,000 was prepared generally in accordance with the following procedure: A three neck flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer is purged free of air with dry nitrogen. To the flask is added 1.5 g. (0.0042 mole) of cobaltic acetylacetonate, followed by 2 ml. of butadiene liquefied at C. To the catalyst is added 100 ml. of benzene. The mixture is stirred and maintained at a temperature of about 10 C.; whereupon 1.5 g. (0.0130 mole) of aluminum triethyl is added. After stirring for 30 minutes the contents of the flask are transferred under a purge of nitrogen to a loading device for attachment and charging to the reactor. A second loader is charged with 2095 g. of butadiene and 2 m1. (0.0122 mole) of diethyl fumarate. Both loaders are attached to a clean dry one gallon glass lined autoclave which has been purged with nitrogen for minutes. To the reactor is added 525 g. of butadiene. Stirring is started and cooling water is circulated around the reactor jacket until the temperature is about 10 C. The pressure is approximately 30 p.s.i.g. The catalyst solution is added by gravity from the other loader to the reactor. After 15 minutes, an additional 525 g. of butadiene is fed to the reactor. Addition is continued at 15 minute intervals until all the monomer has been added. The reaction is continued so that the total time is 4 hours. At the end of this period the product is discharged through the bottom of the reactor into a second vessel equipped with a vent line for unreacted monomer. This vessel contains 2 liters of isopropyl alcohol and 50 ml. of hydrochloric acid. A nitrogen purge is attached to the reactor to pass through the bottom discharge line below the surface of the liquid in the lower vessel. The purge is conducted for 15 minutes. The product is filtered from the deactivation medium and transferred to a blender (Waring) containing 1.5 liters of isopropyl alcohol and 3.4 g. of a commercial hindered polyphenol antioxidant (Irganox 1076). The resin is blended for 15 minutes and filtered. It is transferred to trays and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 C. for 6 hours. There is obtained 680 g. of a white, granular polymer product having at least of the butadiene content combined in the 1,2 form as indicated by infrared spectral data. (2) Commercially available amorphous atactic 1,2- polybutadiene polymers having at least 90% of their butadiene content combined in the 1,2 form as indicated by infrared spectrum, having molecular weights of about 200,000-900,000. (C) Cyclization procedure Polymer was cyclized in 5% toluene solution at C. After purging 3500 ml. of solution with dry nitrogen, 8.5 ml. of 98% boron trifluoride ether complex (Matheson, Coleman and Bell) were added. The solution turned from clear to dark brown on addition of the BF and the reaction proceeded smoothly. Additional 8.5 ml. portions of catalyst were added at /2 hour intervals for the first three hours and at one hour intervals thereafter. After six hours, the reaction was terminated by adding the solution dropwise into a rapidly stirred methanol-ammonia solution to which a small amount (-0.1%) of hindered polyphenol antioxidant had been added. The precipitated polymer was dissolved in chloroform, re-precipitated in methanol (plus antioxidant) and dried under vacuum. The polymer obtained was a light yellow solid, which was soluble in hydrocarbon solvents at room temperature. Its infrared spectrum gave no evidence of residual vinyl unsaturation. Polymer properties are shown in the Tables I-III below. TABLE I.RESULTS OF THERMAL AGING OF OYCLIZED SYNDIOTACTIO 1,2-POLYBUTADIENE IN AIR AT 200 C.

No. 10/494,601, which is a continuation-in-part of international application PCT/US02/35402, which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/338,840 filed on Nov. 5, 2001, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND The present invention is directed toward a process for producing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers. The present invention is also directed to a polymer composition comprising a blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and a terpolymer polymerized from ethylene, at least one Î±-olefin monomer, and at least one diene monomer. Tire sidewalls protect the ply and are therefore preferably resistant to weathering, ozone, abrasion, and tearing, while providing excellent flex fatigue resistance. Typical tire sidewall formulations include natural rubber (NR), styrene-butadiene (SBR), butadiene (BR), and halogenated butyl (HIIR). Ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer (EPDM) is attractive because of its resistance to weathering and ozone. EPDM, however, is not compatible with butadiene rubber and fillers, and has poor cut growth resistance. Blends of EPDM with crystalline polymers have shown improved cut growth properties at room temperature. At elevated temperatures, however, these materials have poor cut growth properties. Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene (sPB) is a crystalline thermoplastic resin that has a stereoregular structure in which the side-chain vinyl groups are located alternately on the opposite sides in relation to the polymeric main chain. sPB uniquely exhibits the properties of both plastics and rubber, and therefore it has many uses. It can also be blended into and co cured with natural and synthetic rubbers. Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene can be made by solution, emulsion, or suspension polymerization. Generally, syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene has a melting temperature within the range of about 195Â° C. to about 215Â° C., but due to processability considerations, it is generally desirable for syndiotactic 1,2 polybutadiene to have a melting temperature of less than about 195Â° C. Because syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is insoluble in common solvents at normal polymerization temperatures, a common technical difficulty in the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is that the polymerization mixture is an extremely thick slurry at the commercially desirable polymer concentration of 10% to 25% by weight. This thick slurry becomes difficult to stir and transfer, thereby diminishing heat transfer efficiency and interfering with proper process control. Also, the slurry contributes to reactor fouling due to the undesirable build-up of insoluble polymer on the baffles, agitator blades, agitator shafts, and walls of the polymerization reactor. It is therefore necessary to clean the reactor on a regular basis, which results in frequent shutdowns of continuous processes and serious limitations of the run length of batch processes. The task of cleaning the fouled reactor is generally difficult and time-consuming. All of these drawbacks detrimentally affect productivity and the cost of operation. The physical properties of rubbery elastomers can be improved by blending crystalline polymers therein. For example, incorporating syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene into rubber compositions that are utilized in the supporting carcass of tires greatly improves the green strength of those compositions. Also, incorporating syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene into tire tread compositions can reduce heat build-up and improve wear characteristics of tires. The green strength of synthetic rubbers such as cis-1,4-polybutadiene can also be improved by incorporating a small amount of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Blends of crystalline polymers and rubbery elastomers are typically prepared by standard mixing techniques. For example, these blends can be prepared by mixing or kneading and heat-treating a crystalline polymer and a rubbery elastomer by utilizing generally known mixing equipment such as a Banbury mixer, a Brabender mixer, an extruder, a kneader, or a mill mixer. These high-temperature mixing procedures, however, have certain drawbacks including high processing costs, polymer degradation and crosslinking, inadequate mixing, as well as various process limitations. Due to the high vinyl content of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene, polymer degradation and crosslinking is a particularly severe problem for mixing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene with elastomers at high temperatures. Attempts to polymerize 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement have been hampered by catalyst inefficiencies and toxicities. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,379,889 teaches polymerizing 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement by using a catalyst system comprising a cobalt compound, a dialkylaluminum halide, carbon disulfide, and an electron donative compound. And, U.S. Pat. No. 5,283,294 teaches a similar process that employs a catalyst system comprising a cobalt compound, an organoaluminum compound, and carbon disulfide. These methods, however, are inferior because the catalyst systems that are employed suffer from low catalytic activity, poor stereoselectivity, the need for toxic, halogenated solvents, and the many drawbacks associated with carbon disulfide including low flash point, obnoxious smell, high volatility and toxicity. Therefore, it would be advantageous to develop a new and significantly improved process for producing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In general, the present invention provides a process for preparing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers comprising the steps of (1) providing a mixture of a rubber cement and 1,3-butadiene monomer; and (2) polymerizing the 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement by using a catalyst composition that is formed by combining, (a) a chromium-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organomagnesium compound or (a) a molybdenum-containing compound or an iron-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organoaluminum compound. The present invention further provides a process for preparing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers comprising the steps of (1) providing a mixture of a rubber cement and 1,3-butadiene monomer, where the rubber cement comprises an elastomeric terpolymer polymerized from ethylene, at least one -olefin monomer, and at least one diene monomer; and (2) preparing a catalyst composition, where the catalyst composition is prepared by combining, outside the presence of the mixture of rubber cement and monomer, (a) a chromium-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organomagnesium compound or (a) a molybdenum-containing compound or an iron-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organoaluminum compound; and (3) adding the catalyst composition to the mixture and thereby polymerizing the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic l 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement. Advantageously, the process of this invention directly provides blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers by synthesizing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement and thereby obviates the need for high-temperature mixing. Also, good dispersion of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene throughout rubbery elastomers can be easily and economically achieved. Significantly, the process of this invention eliminates the problems of high processing costs, polymer degradation and crosslinking, inadequate mixing, and various process limitations that are associated with high-temperature mixing procedures. The process of this invention also alleviates the problems of polymer cement thickness and reactor fouling that are associated with the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in the absence of a rubbery elastomer. In addition, the catalyst systems employed in this invention have very high catalytic activity and stereoselectivity for the syndiospecific polymerization of 1,3-butadiene. This activity and selectivity, among other advantages, allows syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to be produced in very high yields within a rubber cement. Additionally, these catalyst compositions do not contain carbon disulfide, and therefore the toxicity, objectionable smell, dangers, and expense associated with the use of carbon disulfide are eliminated. Further, the chromium, molybdenum, and iron compounds are generally stable, inexpensive, relatively innocuous, and readily available. Furthermore, these catalyst compositions have high catalytic activity in a wide variety of solvents including the environmentally preferred nonhalogenated solvents such as aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons. Furthermore, blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and elastomeric terpolymers polymerized from ethylene, at least one Î±-olefin monomer, and at least one diene monomer, prepared by the process of the present invention, exhibit improved cut growth resistance at elevated temperatures. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS The present invention is generally directed toward a process for producing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers. Blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers can be directly produced by polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2 polybutadiene within a rubber cement by using chromium-based, molybdenum-based, or iron-based catalyst compositions. The process includes the steps of: (1) providing a mixture of a rubber cement and 1,3-butadiene monomer, where the rubber cement includes at least one rubbery elastomer within an organic solvent, and (2) polymerizing the 1,3 butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement by using a chromium-based, molybdenum-based, or iron-based catalyst composition. The chromium-based catalyst composition is formed by combining (a) a chromium-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organomagnesium compound. The molybdenum-based catalyst composition is formed by combining (a) a molybdenum-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organoaluminum compound. The iron-based catalyst composition is formed by combining (a) an iron-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organoaluminum compound. The rubber cement employed in this invention is a solution, preferably viscous, of at least one rubbery elastomer in an organic solvent. Virtually any type of rubbery elastomer can be used to prepare the rubber cement. In a preferred embodiment, the rubbery elastomer includes an elastomeric terpolymer polymerized from ethylene, at least one Î±-olefin monomer, and at least one diene monomer. The Î±-olefins may include, but are not limited to, propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-octene, 1-decene, or combinations thereof. The diene monomers may include, but are not limited to, 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene, 1,4-hexadiene, 5-methylene-2-norbornene, 1,6-octadiene, 5-methyl-1,4-hexadiene, 3,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadiene, 1,3-cyclopentadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, dicyclopentadiene, 5-vinyl-2-norbornene and the like, or a combination thereof. When the terpolymer is polymerized from ethylene, propylene, and at least one diene monomer, the polymer may be referred to as EPDM. Elastomeric terpolymers prepared from ethylene, at least one Î±-olefin monomer, and at least one diene monomer may be prepared by methods known in the art, and they are commercially available under the tradenames Vistalon\u0099 (Exxon Mobil Chemical Co.; Houston, Tex.), Keltan\u0099 (DSM Copolymers; Baton Rouge, La.), Nordel\u0099 IP (DuPont Dow Elastomers; Wilmington, Del.), ElastoFlo\u0099 (Union Carbide; Danbury, Conn.), and Buna\u0099 (Bayer Corp.; Germany). The elastomeric terpolymers described above may be used in combination with each other, or other rubbery elastomers. Examples of other rubbery elastomers include, but are not limited to, natural rubber, low-vinyl polybutadiene, cis-1,4-polybutadiene, amorphous 1,2-polybutadiene, low-vinyl polyisoprene, cis-1,4-polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, neoprene, ethylene-propylene copolymer rubber (EPR), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), styrene-isoprene rubber (SIR), styrene-isoprene-butadiene rubber (SIBR), styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SBS), styrene-butadiene block copolymer (SB), hydrogenated styrene butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SEBS), hydrogenated styrene-butadiene block copolymer (SEB), styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer (SIS), styrene-isoprene block copolymer (SI), hydrogenated styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer (SEPS), hydrogenated styrene-isoprene block copolymer (SEP), polysulfide rubber, acrylic rubber, urethane rubber, silicone rubber, epichlorohydrin rubber, and the like. Mixtures of the above rubbery elastomers may also be used. These rubbery elastomers are well known and, for the most part, are commercially available. Also, those skilled in the art will be able to readily synthesize these rubbery elastomers by using techniques that are well known in the art. The rubber cement can be prepared by dissolving the rubbery elastomers in an organic solvent. When commercially available rubbery elastomers are employed to prepare the rubber cement, it may be necessary to purify the commercial products before use in order to remove residual water and additives that may become catalyst poisons in the subsequent step of polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement. In one embodiment, the rubber cement is prepared in situ by polymerizing one or more appropriate monomers into rubbery elastomers in an organic solvent within the same reactor that is subsequently used for polymerizing 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Many methods of synthesizing rubbery elastomers are known in the art. Preferably, however, the catalyst utilized in preparing the rubbery elastomers should not contain any ingredients that may interfere with the catalyst subsequently used in the step of polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement. In preparing the rubber cement, it is desirable to select an organic solvent that is inert with respect to the catalyst systems that will be employed to synthesize the rubbery elastomers and the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Suitable types of organic solvents that can be utilized in preparing the rubber cement include, but are not limited to, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, and aromatic hydrocarbons. Some representative examples of suitable aliphatic solvents include n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, n-decane, isopentane, isohexanes, isoheptanes, isooctanes, 2,2-dimethylbutane, petroleum ether, kerosene, petroleum spirits, and the like. Some representative examples of suitable cycloaliphatic solvents include cyclopentane, cyelohexane, methylcyclopentane, methylcyclohexane, and the like. Some representative examples of suitable aromatic solvents include benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, diethylbenzene, mesitylene, and the like. Commercial mixtures of the above hydrocarbons may also be used. For environmental reasons, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic solvents are highly preferred. The concentration of the rubbery elastomers in the rubber cement varies depending on the types of the rubbery elastomers and organic solvent employed. The concentration of the rubbery elastomers within the cement is preferably from about 5% to about 35% by weight of the rubber cement, more preferably from about 10% to 30% by weight of the rubber cement, and even more preferably from about 15% to about 25% by weight of the rubber cement. The rubber cement is then utilized as a polymerization medium for the stereospecific polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Thus, 1,3-butadiene monomer, catalyst composition, and optionally additional organic solvent are added to the rubber cement. The order in which the 1,3-butadiene monomer, the catalyst composition, and the solvent are added to the rubber cement does not limit the scope of the invention, although it may be preferable to add the catalyst composition, or at least an ingredient thereof, prior to adding the 1,3-butadiene monomer. The amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer added to the rubber cement is contingent upon the proportion of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene desired in the resultant polymer blend. The additional organic solvent can be selected from the group of the organic solvents mentioned above for the preparation of the rubber cement, and may be the same as or different from the organic solvent used in preparing the rubber cement. The addition of 1,3-butadiene monomer to the rubber cement may not be required in the case where 1,3-butadiene monomer is employed to prepare the rubbery elastomers and the polymerization is stopped before all the 1,3-butadiene is consumed, thereby providing the remaining 1,3-butadiene monomer for synthesizing the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene without the need to add additional 1,3-butadiene monomer. Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention is directed toward the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement, other conjugated diene monomers can be polymerized to form conjugated diene polymers, preferably crystalline polymers, within a rubber cement. Chromium-based catalyst compositions useful for the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,201,080 and 6,117,956, which are incorporated herein by reference. The preferred chromium-based catalyst composition is formed by combining (a) a chromium-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organomagnesium compound. In addition to the three catalyst ingredients (a), (b), and (c), other organometallic compounds or Lewis bases that are known in the art can also be added, if desired. Various chromium-containing compounds or mixtures thereof can be employed as ingredient (a) of the chromium-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention. It is generally advantageous to employ chromium-containing compounds that are soluble in a hydrocarbon solvent such as aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbon-insoluble chromium-containing compounds, however, can be suspended in the polymerization medium to form the catalytically active species and are therefore also useful. The chromium atom in the chromium-containing compounds can be in various oxidation states ranging from 0 up to +6. Divalent chromium compounds (also called chromous compounds), wherein the chromium is in the +2 oxidation state, and trivalent chromium compounds (also called chromic compounds), wherein the chromium is in the +3 oxidation state are preferred.

Useful hydrogen phosphite compounds that can be employed as ingredient (b) of the chromium-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention are either acyclic hydrogen phosphites, cyclic hydrogen phosphites, or mixtures thereof. In general, acyclic hydrogen phosphites may be represented by the following keto-enol tautomeric structures: where R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, are mono-valent organic groups. Preferably, R1 and R2 are hydrocarbyl groups such as, but not limited to, alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, substituted cycloalkenyl, aryl, allyl, substituted aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, and alkynyl groups, with each group preferably containing from 1 carbon atom, or the appropriate minimum number of carbon atoms to form the group, up to 20 carbon atoms. These hydrocarbyl groups may contain heteroatoms such as, but not limited to, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus atoms. The acyclic hydrogen phosphites exist mainly as the keto tautomer (shown on the left), with the enol tautomer (shown on the right) being the minor species. The equilibrium constant for the above-mentioned tautomeric equilibrium is dependent upon factors such as the temperature, the types of R1 and R2 groups, the type of solvent, and the like. Both tautomers may be associated in dimeric, trimeric or oligomeric forms by hydrogen bonding. Either of the two tautomers or mixtures thereof can be employed as the ingredient (b) of the chromium-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention. Suitable acyclic hydrogen phosphites include dimethyl hydrogen phosphite, diethyl hydrogen phosphite, dibutyl hydrogen phosphite, dihexyl hydrogen phosphite, dioctyl hydrogen phosphite, didecyl hydrogen phosphite, didodecyl hydrogen phosphite, dioctadecyl hydrogen phosphite, bis(2,2,2 trifluoroethyl)hydrogen phosphite, diisopropyl hydrogen phosphite, bis(3,3 dimethyl-2-butyl)hydrogen phosphite, bis(2,4-dimethyl-3-pentyl)hydrogen phosphite, di-t-butyl hydrogen phosphite, bis(2-ethylhexyl)hydrogen phosphite, dineopentyl hydrogen phosphite, bis(cyclopropylmethyl)hydrogen phosphite, bis(cyclobutylmethyl) hydrogen phosphite, bis(cyclopentylmethyl)hydrogen phosphite, bis(cyclohexylmethyl)hydrogen phosphite, dicyclobutyl hydrogen phosphite, dicyclopentyl hydrogen phosphite, dicyclohexyl hydrogen phosphite, dimethyl hydrogen phosphite, diphenyl hydrogen phosphite, dinaphthyl hydrogen phosphite, dibenzyl hydrogen phosphite, bis(1-naphthylmethyl)hydrogen phosphite, diallyl hydrogen phosphite, dimethallyl hydrogen phosphite, dicrotyl hydrogen phosphite, ethyl butyl hydrogen phosphite, methyl hexyl hydrogen phosphite, methyl neopentyl hydrogen phosphite, methyl phenyl hydrogen phosphite, methyl cyclohexyl hydrogen phosphite, methyl benzyl hydrogen phosphite, and the like. Mixtures of the above dihydrocarbyl hydrogen phosphites may also be utilized. In general, cyclic hydrogen phosphites contain a divalent organic group that bridges between the two oxygen atoms that are singly-bonded to the phosphorus atoms. These cyclic hydrogen phosphites may be represented by the following keto-enol tautomeric structures: where R3 is a divalent organic group. Preferably, R3 is a hydrocarbylene group such as, but not limited to, alkylene, cycloalkylene, substituted alkylene, substituted cycloalkylene, alkenylene, cycloalkenylene, substituted alkenylene, substituted cycloalkenylene, arylene, and substituted arylene groups, with each group preferably containing from 1 carbon atom, or the appropriate minimum number of carbon atoms to form the group, up to 20 carbon atoms. These hydrocarbylene groups may contain heteroatoms such as, but not limited to, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus atoms. The cyclic hydrogen phosphites exist mainly as the keto tautomer (shown on the left), with the enol tautomer (shown on the right) being the minor species. The equilibrium constant for the above-mentioned tautomeric equilibrium is dependent upon factors such as the temperature, the types of R3 group, the type of solvent, and the like. Both tautomers may be associated in dimeric, trimeric or oligomeric forms by hydrogen bonding. Either of the two tautomers or mixtures thereof can be employed as the ingredient (b) of the chromium-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention. The cyclic hydrogen phosphites may be synthesized by the transesterification reaction of an acyclic dihydrocarbyl hydrogen phosphite (usually dimethyl hydrogen phosphite or diethyl hydrogen phosphite) with an alkylene diol or an arylene diol. Procedures for this transesterification reaction are well known to those skilled in the art. Typically, the transesterification reaction is carried out by heating a mixture of an acyclic dihydrocarbyl hydrogen phosphite and an alkylene diol or an arylene diol.

These hydrocarbyl groups may contain heteroatoms such as, but not limited to, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus atoms. It should be noted that the number of moles of the aluminoxane as used in this application refers to the number of moles of the aluminum atoms rather than the number of moles of the oligomeric aluminoxane molecules. This convention is commonly employed in the art of catalysis utilizing aluminoxanes. In general, aluminoxanes can be prepared by reacting trihydrocarbylaluminum compounds with water. This reaction can be performed according to known methods, such as (1) a method in which the trihydrocarbylaluminum compound is dissolved in an organic solvent and then contacted with water, (2) a method in which the trihydrocarbylaluminum compound is reacted with water of crystallization contained in, for example, metal salts, or water adsorbed in inorganic or organic compounds, and (3) a method in which the trihydrocarbylaluminum compound is added to the monomer or monomer solution that is to be oligomerized, and then water is added.

The iron-based catalyst compositions are formed by combining (a) an iron-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organoaluminum compound. Various iron-containing compounds or mixtures thereof can be employed as ingredient (a) of the iron-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention. Iron-containing compounds that are soluble in a hydrocarbon solvent such as aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons are preferably used. Hydrocarbon-insoluble iron-containing compounds, however, can be suspended in the polymerization medium to form the catalytically active species, and are therefore also useful. The iron atom in the iron-containing compounds can be in various oxidation states including, but not limited to, the 0, +2, +3, and +4 oxidation states.

Useful hydrogen phosphite compounds that can be employed as ingredient (b) of the iron-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention are either acyclic hydrogen phosphite, cyclic hydrogen phosphites, or mixtures thereof. These compounds are described above. Useful organoaluminum compounds that can be employed as ingredient (c) of the molybdenum-based catalyst composition, described above, are also suitable for use as ingredient (c) of the iron-based catalyst composition. The catalyst compositions utilized in this invention have very high catalytic activity for polymerizing 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene over a wide range of total catalyst concentrations and catalyst ingredient ratios. The polymers having the most desirable properties, however, are obtained within a narrower range of total catalyst concentrations and catalyst ingredient ratios. Further, it is believed that the three catalyst ingredients (a), (b), and (c) can interact to form an active catalyst species. Accordingly, the optimum concentration for any one catalyst ingredient is dependent upon the concentrations of the other catalyst ingredients. With respect to the chromium-based catalyst composition, the molar ratio of the hydrogen phosphite to the chromium-containing compound (P/Cr) can be varied from about 0.5:1 to about 50:1, more preferably from about 1:1 to about 25:1, and even more preferably from about 2:1 to about 10:1. The molar ratio of the organomagnesium compound to the chromium-containing compound (Mg/Cr) can be varied from about 1:1 to about 50:1, more preferably from about 2:1 to about 30:1, and even more preferably from about 3:1 to about 20:1. With respect to the molybdenum-based or iron-based catalyst compositions, the molar ratio of the hydrogen phosphite to the molybdenum containing compound (P/Mo) or to the iron-containing compound (P/Fe) can be varied from about 0.5:1 to about 50:1, more preferably from about 1:1 to about 25:1, and even more preferably from about 2:1 to about 10:1. Where ingredient (c) of the catalyst composition comprises an organoaluminum compound defined by the formula AIRnX3-n, the molar ratio of the organoaluminum compound to the molybdenum-containing compound (Al/Mo) or to the iron-containing compound (Al/Fe) can be varied from about 1:1 to about 100:1, more preferably from about 3:1 to about 50:1, and even more preferably from about 5:1 to about 25:1. When ingredient (c) of the catalyst composition utilized in the present invention comprises an aluminoxane, the molar ratio of the aluminoxane to the molybdenum-containing compound (Al/Mo) or to the iron-containing compound (Al/Fe) can be varied from about 5:1 to about 500:1, more preferably from about 10:1 to about 200:1, and even more preferably from about 20:1 to about 100:1. The catalyst composition is preferably formed by combining the three catalyst ingredients (a), (b), and (c). Although an active catalyst species is believed to result from this combination, the degree of interaction or reaction between the various ingredients or components is not known with any great degree of certainty. Therefore, it should be understood that the term \u0093catalyst composition\u0094 has been employed to encompass a simple mixture of the ingredients, a complex of the various ingredients that is caused by physical or chemical forces of attraction, a chemical reaction product of the ingredients, or a combination of the foregoing. The catalyst composition utilized to prepare the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene can be formed by combining or mixing the catalyst ingredients or components by using, for example, one of the following methods: First, the catalyst composition may be formed in situ by adding the three catalyst ingredients to the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and 1,3-butadiene monomer in either a stepwise or simultaneous manner. When adding the catalyst ingredients in a stepwise manner, the sequence in which the ingredients are added is not critical. With regard to the chromium-based catalyst, the organomagnesium compound is preferably added first, followed by the chromium-containing compound, and then followed by the hydrogen phosphite. With regard to the molybdenum-based or iron-based catalyst, the molybdenum-containing or iron-containing compound is preferably added first, followed by the hydrogen phosphite, and then followed by the organoaluminum compound. Second, the three catalyst ingredients may be pre-mixed outside the polymerization system at an appropriate temperature, which is generally from about âˆ’20Â° C. to about 80Â° C., and the resulting catalyst composition is then added to the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and 1,3-butadiene monomer. Third, the catalyst composition may be pre-formed in the presence of conjugated diene monomer. That is, the three catalyst ingredients are pre-mixed in the presence of a small amount of conjugated diene monomer at an appropriate temperature, which is generally from about âˆ’20Â° C. to about 80Â° C. The amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer that is used for the catalyst pre-forming can range from about 1 to about 500 moles, more preferably from about 4 to about 100 moles, and even more preferably from about 10 to about 50 moles per mole of the chromium-containing, molybdenum-containing, or iron-containing compound. The resulting catalyst composition is then added to the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and the 1,3-butadiene monomer that is to be polymerized. Fourth, as a further variation, the catalyst composition can also be formed by using a two-stage procedure. The first stage involves combining the chromium-containing compound and the organomagnesium compound or the molybdenum-containing or iron-containing compound and the organoaluminum compound, in the presence of a small amount of conjugated diene monomer at an appropriate temperature, which is generally from about âˆ’20Â° C. to about 80Â° C. In the second stage, the foregoing reaction mixture and the hydrogen phosphite are charged in either a stepwise or simultaneous manner to the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and the 1,3-butadiene monomer that is to be polymerized. Fifth, an alternative two-stage procedure may also be employed. A chromium-ligand, molybdenum-ligand, or iron-ligand, complex is first formed by pre-combining the chromium-containing compound, molybdenum-containing compound, or iron-containing and the hydrogen phosphite compound. Once formed, the chromium complex is then combined with the organomagnesium compound, or the molybdenum or iron complex is combined with the organoaluminum compound, respectively, to form the active catalyst species. The complex can be formed separately or in the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and the 1,3-butadiene monomer that is to be polymerized. This complexation reaction can be conducted at any convenient temperature at normal pressure, but for an increased rate of reaction, it is preferred to perform this reaction at room temperature or above. The time required for the formation of the complex is usually within the range of about 10 minutes to about 2 hours after mixing the chromium-containing, molybdenum-containing or iron-containing compound with the hydrogen phosphite compound. The temperature and time used for the formation of the complex will depend upon several variables including the particular starting materials and the solvent employed. Once formed, the complex can be used without isolation from the complexation reaction mixture. If desired, however, the complex may be isolated from the complexation reaction mixture before use. Sixth, the three catalyst ingredients may be added to the rubber cement prior to or simultaneously with the addition of 1,3-butadiene monomer. When a solution of the catalyst composition or one or more of the catalyst ingredients is prepared outside the polymerization system as set forth in the foregoing methods, an organic solvent or carrier is preferably employed. Useful organic solvents are described above. Organic solvents may serve to dissolve the catalyst composition or ingredients, or the solvent may simply serve as a carrier in which the catalyst composition or ingredients may be suspended. The production of blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers according to this invention is accomplished by polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer within the rubber cement by using a catalytically effective amount of at least one of the foregoing catalyst compositions. The total catalyst concentration to be employed in the polymerization mass depends on the interplay of various factors such as the purity of the ingredients, the polymerization temperature, the polymerization rate and conversion desired, and many other factors. Accordingly, a specific total catalyst concentration cannot be definitively set forth except to say that catalytically effective amounts of the respective catalyst ingredients should be used. Generally, the amount of the chromium-containing, molybdenum-containing, or iron-containing compound used can be varied from about 0.01 to about 2 mmol per 100 g of 1,3-butadiene monomer, more preferably from about 0.02 to about 1.0 mmol per 100 g of 1,3-butadiene monomer, and even more preferably from about 0.05 to about 0.5 mmol per 100 g of 1,3-butadiene monomer. In performing the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement, a molecular weight regulator may be employed to control the molecular weight of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to be produced. As a result, the scope of the polymerization system can be expanded in such a manner that it can be used for the production of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene having a wide range of molecular weights. Suitable types of molecular weight regulators that can be utilized include, but are not limited to, Î±-olefins such as ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, and 1-octene; accumulated diolefins such as allene and 1,2-butadiene; nonconjugated diolefins such as 1,6-octadiene, 5-methyl-1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene, 3,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, 4-vinylcyclohexene, 1,4-pentadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-hexadiene, 1,6-heptadiene, 1,2-divinylcyclohexane, 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene, 5-methylene-2-norbornene, 5-vinyl-2-norbornene, dicyclopentadiene, and 1,2,4-trivinylcyclohexane; acetylenes such as acetylene, methylacetylene and vinylacetylene; and mixtures thereof. The amount of the molecular weight regulator used, expressed in parts per hundred parts by weight of the 1,3-butadiene monomer (phm), is from about 0.01 to about 10 phm, more preferably from about 0.02 to about 2 phm, and even more preferably from about 0.05 to about 1 phm. The molecular weight of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to be produced can also be effectively controlled by conducting the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer in the presence of hydrogen gas. In this case, the partial pressure of hydrogen gas is preferably from about 0.01 to about 50 atmospheres. The polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement may be carried out as a batch process, a continuous process, or even a semi-continuous process. In the semi-continuous process, 1,3-butadiene monomer is intermittently charged as needed to replace that monomer already polymerized. In any case, the polymerization is desirably conducted under anaerobic conditions by using an inert protective gas such as nitrogen, argon or helium, with moderate to vigorous agitation. The polymerization temperature may vary widely from a low temperature, such as âˆ’10Â° C. or below, to a high temperature such as 100Â° C. or above, with a preferred temperature range being from about 20Â° C. to about 90Â° C. The heat of polymerization may be removed by external cooling, cooling by evaporation of the 1,3-butadiene monomer or the solvent, or a combination of the two methods. Although the polymerization pressure employed may vary widely, a preferred pressure range is from about 1 atmosphere to about 10 atmospheres. Once a desired conversion is achieved, the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement can be stopped by adding a polymerization terminator that inactivates the catalyst system. Typically, the terminator employed to inactivate the catalyst system is a protic compound, which includes, but is not limited to, an alcohol, a carboxylic acid, an inorganic acid, water, or a combination thereof. An antioxidant such as 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol may be added along with, before or after the addition of the terminator. The amount of the antioxidant employed is usually in the range of 0.2% to 1% by weight of the polymer product. When the polymerization reaction has been stopped, the blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and the rubbery elastomer can be recovered from the polymerization mixture by utilizing conventional procedures of desolventization and drying. For instance, the blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and the rubbery elastomer may be isolated from the polymerization mixture by coagulation of the polymerization mixture with an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol, or by steam distillation of the solvent and the unreacted 1,3-butadiene monomer, followed by filtration. The product is then dried to remove residual amounts of solvent and water. The polymer blend produced is a highly dispersed blend of crystalline syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in the rubbery elastomer. Advantageously, the catalyst composition employed in this invention can be manipulated to vary the characteristics of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in the polymer blend. Namely, the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in the polymer blend made by the process of this invention can have various melting temperatures, molecular weights, 1,2-linkage contents, and syndiotacticities, all of which are dependent upon the selection of the catalyst ingredients and the ingredient ratios. The blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers produced with the process of this invention have many uses. For example, these blends can be utilized in rubber compositions that are used to manufacture the supporting carcass, innerliner, sidewall, and tread of tires. The blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers are also useful in the manufacture of films and packaging materials and in many molding applications. In a preferred embodiment, the blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in rubbery elastomer is added to rubber compositions that are useful in the manufacture of tires. As is generally known in the art, these rubber compositions or tire formulations include a base rubber, filler, vulcanizing agent, and sundry additional additives that are common in rubber compounding. Both synthetic and natural rubber may be employed within the rubber compositions. These rubbers, which may also be referred to as elastomers, include, without limitation, natural rubber, synthetic polyisoprene, poly(styrene-co-butadiene), polybutadiene, poly(styrene-co-butadiene-co-isoprene), poly(styrene-co-isoprene), and mixtures thereof. The rubber compositions may include fillers such as inorganic and organic fillers. Organic fillers include carbon black. Inorganic fillers include silica, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and clays (hydrated aluminum silicates). A multitude of rubber vulcanizing agents, which are also referred to as curing agents, can be employed within these rubber compositions. For example, sulfur or peroxide-based curing systems may be employed. Also, see Kirk Othmer, ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY, 3rd Edition, Wiley Interscience, 30N.Y. 1982, Vol. 20, pp. 365-468, particularly VULCANIZATION AGENTS AND AUXILIARY MATERIALS pp. 390-402, or Vulcanization by A. Y. Coran, ENCYCLOPEDIA OF POLYMER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, 2nd Edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1989, which are incorporated herein by reference. Vulcanizing agents may be used alone or in combination. The rubber compositions may also include other compounding additives such as accelerators, oils, waxes, scorch inhibiting agents, processing aids, antidegradants, zinc oxide, optional tackifying resins, optional reinforcing resins, optional fatty acids, and optional peptizers. In one preferred embodiment, a blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and EPDM, prepared according to the process of this invention, is employed with a rubber composition that is useful for the manufacture of tire sidewalls. The preferred blend includes from about 0.4 to about 12 parts by weight SPB and from about 99.6 to about 88 parts by weight EPDM. More preferably, the blend includes from about 2 to about 10 parts by weight SPB and from about 98 to about 90 parts by weight EPDM. When practicing this embodiment, the blend is combined and compounded with a base rubber in an amount from about 1 to about 40 parts by weight blend phr, preferably from about 2 to about 20 parts by weight phr, and even more preferably from about 5 to about 10 parts by weight blend phr. Sidewall formulations also typically include a filler, which is employed in an amount from about 10 to about 70 parts by weight phr, preferably from 20 about 20 to about 60 parts by weight phr, and more preferably from about 25 to about 50 parts by weight phr. The syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the EPDM rubbery elastomer that is utilized in tire sidewall formulations preferably has a melting temperature from about 70 to about 210Â° C., more preferably from about 90 to about 195Â° C., and even more preferably from about 110Â° C. to about 190Â° C. Fillers are typically employed in an amount from about 1 to about 100 parts by weight phr, and preferably from about 20 to about 90 parts by weight phr, and more preferably from about 40 to about 80 parts by weight pier. Those skilled in the art will be able to choose a useful amount of the other ingredients that may be employed in these rubber compositions. For example, it is generally known in the art of making tire components that sulfur is typically employed in an amount from about 0.5 to about 10 parts by weight phr, and preferably from about 1 to about 6 parts by weight phr. Oils are typically employed in an amount from about 1 to about 60 parts by weight phr, and preferably in an amount from about 1 to about 50 parts by weight phr. Zinc oxide is typically employed in an amount from about 0.5 to about 8 by weight phr, and preferably from about 1 to about 5 parts by weight phr. Rubber formulations are compounded by using mixing equipment and procedures conventionally employed in the art. Preferably, an initial masterbatch is prepared that includes the rubber component and the reinforcing fillers, as well as other optional additives such as processing oil and antidegradants. The blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and EPDM is preferably added during preparation of the initial masterbatch. This masterbatch is typically mixed at temperatures in excess of about 100 or 150Â° C. To prevent premature vulcanization, also known as scorch, the initial masterbatch generally excludes the vulcanizing agent. Once the initial masterbatch is prepared, the vulcanizing agent is blended into the composition at lower temperatures. Rubber compounding techniques and the additives employed therein are generally known as disclosed in The Compounding and Vulcanization of Rubber, by Stevens in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY SECOND EDITION (1973 Van Nostrand Reihold Company). The mixing conditions and procedures applicable to silica-filled tire formulations are also well known as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,227,425; 5,719,207; 5,717,022, as well as EP 0890606, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The rubber compositions can then be processed into tire components, including sidewalls, according to ordinary tire manufacturing techniques including standard rubber molding and curing techniques. Typically, vulcanization is effected by heating the vulcanizable composition in a mold; e.g., it is heated to about 170Â° C. Cured or crosslinked rubber compositions may be referred to as vulcanizates, which generally contain three-dimensional polymeric networks that are thermoset. The other ingredients, such as fillers, oils, and antidegradants, are generally dispersed throughout the network. While the blends of this invention are preferably added to formulations used to make tire sidewalls, the blend can also be used within other tire components such as treads, subtreads, body ply skims, bead fillers and the like. Pneumatic tires can be made as discussed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,866,171; 5,876,527; 5,931,211; and 5,971,046, which are incorporated herein by reference. In order to demonstrate the practice of the present invention, the following examples have been prepared and tested as described in the Examples disclosed hereinbelow. The examples should not, however, be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. The claims will serve to define the invention. EXAMPLES Example 1 Preparation of sPB/EPDM Blend A highly dispersed blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and EPDM was prepared by polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within an EPDM rubber cement. The EPDM rubber cement was prepared by dissolving 50 g of EPDM to form a solution containing 15% by weight solids by dissolving in 300 grams of hexane. The EPDM contained about 56% ethylene, about 6% 5-ethylidene-2-norborene, had a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 60,000 and a Mooney Viscosity (ML1+4@100Â° C.) of about 35. At room temperature, adding 12 grams of a 1,3-butadiene/hexane blend containing 22.4% by weight of 1,3-butadiene were added to the EPDM rubber cement produced above. The polymerization of the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was initiated by the addition of 6.25 mL of 0.032 M iron (III) 2-ethylhexanoate in hexanes, 0.27 mL of 2.93 M bis(2-ethylhexyl)hydrogen phosphite in hexanes, and 6.0 mL of 0.68 M triisobutylaluminum in hexanes. The polymerization was conducted at 50Â° C. for 6 hours. The polymerization was stopped by the addition of 3 mL of isopropanol diluted with 50 mL of hexanes. The polymerization mixture was added into 10 liters of isopropanol containing 12 g of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. The polymer blend of 3% syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in EPDM was isolated by filtration and dried to a constant weight under vacuum of 60Â° C. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed a broad Tm peak, between 190Â°-205Â° C., that was attributed to the formation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. A blend containing 6% syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in EPDM and a blend containing 12% syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in EPDM were prepared exactly as above, except that the amounts of 1,3-butadiene monomer and catalyst components were adjusted. Analysis showed that SPB did form within the EPDM as evidenced by melting temperature peaks (Tm) within a DSC curve. Example 2 Preparation of a 6% sPB/EPDM blend Approximately 50 grams of an EPDM sample (E/P=55/45, Mn=60 k, the diene is 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene or ENB, 6%) was dissolved in 450 mL of hexanes to form a solution containing 15% solids. A mixture of 1,3-butadiene (Bd) monomer in hexanes was charged (5.0 grams total of Bd) followed by the addition of Fe(EHA)3 (0.1 mmol) in hexanes, HPO(OEH)2 (0.4 mmol) in hexanes and TIBA (2 mmol) in hexanes. The mixture was agitated at 50Â° C. for 6 hours. The reaction mixture was poured into isopropyl alcohol with agitation, isolated, air-dried, and then vacuum-dried to remove any remaining solvent. The polymer mixture was analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) which revealed a broad Tm peak (Tm=190-205Â° C.) attributed to the formation of the sPB.

Tearing Energy (J/m2) 1210 1145 Dc/Dn (nm/cycle) was measured in a \u0093pure shear\u0094 geometry with a precut [Reference: Lake G J, Rubber Chemistry and Technology, 68: (3), 435-460, 1995]. The testing sheet had a length of 20.32 cm, a height of 64.5 mm and a thickness of 2 mm. A pre-cut of 4.0 cm was made along the length direction. Cyclic deformation was applied along the height direction with a strain amplitude of 2.5% to 25%, and with a frequency of 1 to 100 Hz. The testing condition was a 40 Hz half-sinusoidal pulse for a 5 HZ deformation cycle under 10% strain amplitude at various temperatures (23Â° C.-80Â° C.). Images of the propagating crack were recorded automatically at a given interval of about 10,000 cycles. Crack growth rate (dc/dn) is then calculated by the increment of crack length at each cycle (nm/cycles). This type of cut growth rate of 45 and below is advantageous in many applications. Although the present invention has been described in the above examples with reference to particular means, materials and embodiments, it would be obvious to persons skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made, which fall within the scope claimed for the invention as set out in the appended claims. The invention is therefore not limited to the particulars disclosed and extends to all equivalents within the scope of the claims."

Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is a thermoplastic resin and is cocurable with conventional rubbers due to its residual unsaturation. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a process for producing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and a catalyst composition for use therein. Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is a thermoplastic resin that has a stereoregular structure in which the vinyl groups as side chains are located alternately on the opposite sides in relation to the polymeric main chain consisting of carbon-carbon bonds. Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is a unique material that combines the properties of plastics and rubber.Accordingly, syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene has many uses. For example, films, fibers and molded articles can be made utilizing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. It can also be blended into rubbers and cocured therewith. Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene can be made by solution, emulsion or suspension polymerization. The syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene from solution, emulsion or suspension polymerization typically has a melting temperature that is within the range of about 195 C to 215 C. However, for processability reasons it is generally desirable for syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to have a melting temperature of less than about 195 Cto render it suitable for practical utilization. Various transition metal catalyst systems based on cobalt, titanium, vanadium, chromium, and molybdenum have been reported in the prior art for the preparation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene (see, e.g., L. Porri and A. Giarrusso, in Comprehensive Polymer Science, edited by G. C. Eastmond, A. Ledwith, S. Russo and P. Sigwalt, Pergamon Press: Oxford, 1989, Volume 4, Page 53). However, the majority of these catalyst systems have no practical utility because they have low catalytic activity or poor stereoselectivity and in some cases produce low molecular weight polymers or crosslinked polymers unsuitable for commercial use. The following two catalyst systems based on cobalt-containing compounds are well known for the preparation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene on a commercial scale: (1) cobalt bis(acetylacetonate)/triethylaluminum/water/triphenylphosphine (U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,498,963 and 4,182,813; Jap. Kokoku 44-32426, assigned to Japan Synthetic Rubber Co.Ltd.), and (2) cobalt tris(acetylacetonate)/triethylaluminum/carbon disulfide (U.S. Pat. No. 3,778,424; Jap. Kokoku 72-19,892, 81-18,127, 74-17,666, and 74-17,667; Jap. Kokai 81-88,408, 81-88,409, 81-88,410, 75-59,480, 75-121,380, and 75-121,379, assigned to Ube Industries Ltd.). These cobalt-based catalyst systems also have serious disadvantages. The cobalt bis(acetylacetonate)/triethylaluminum/water/triphenylphosphine system yields syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene having very low crystallinity. In addition, this catalyst system develops sufficient catalytic activity only in halogenated hydrocarbon solvents as the polymerization medium, and halogenated solvents present the problems of toxicity. The cobalt tris(acetylacetonate)/triethylaluminum/carbon disulfide system uses carbon disulfide as one of the catalyst components. Because of its high volatility, obnoxious smell, low flash point and toxicity, carbon disulfide is difficult and dangerous to use and requires expensive safety measures to prevent even minimal amounts escaping into the atmosphere.Furthermore, the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene produced with this catalyst system has a very high melting temperature within the range of 200-210 C, which makes it difficult to process the polymer. Although the melting temperature of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene can be reduced by the use of a catalyst modifier as a fourth catalyst component, the presence of such a catalyst modifier also has an adverse effect on the catalyst activity and polymer yields. Accordingly, many restrictions are required for the industrial utilization of the two aforesaid cobalt-based catalyst systems of the prior art.Coordination catalyst systems based on iron-containing compounds such as iron(III) acetylacetonate/triethylaluminum have been known in the prior art for a long time, but they have very low catalytic activity and poor stereoselectivity for the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene and sometimes give rise to oligomers, low molecular weight liquid polymers or crosslinked polymers. Therefore, these iron-based catalyst systems of the prior art have no industrial utility. Under such circumstances, in order to overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages of the prior art, intensive research and investigations were made by the present inventor for the purpose of developing and providing a new and significantly improved catalyst composition, which is not restricted technically in industrial utilization and has high catalytic activity and stereoselectivity for the production of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene having various melting temperatures. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene having various melting temperatures and syndiotacticities without the above-mentioned disadvantages of the prior art. It is another object of the present invention to provide a process for efficiently producing the aforesaid syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a versatile and inexpensive catalyst composition, which has high catalytic activity and stereoselectivity for use in the production of the aforesaid syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Other objects and natures of the present invention will become obvious from the description in the text of the specification hereinafter disclosed. It has been found that the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene by the use of a specified iron-based catalyst composition is capable of efficiently producing the objective syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Specifically, the present invention relates to a catalyst composition which can be utilized in the stereospecific polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene, said catalyst composition 1o being comprised of: (a) an iron-containing compound, (b) a cyclic hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organoaluminum compound. The present invention further relates to a process for the production of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene, which comprises polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer in the presence of a catalytically effective amount of the foregoing catalyst composition. By utilizing the process and catalyst composition of the present invention, numerous distinct and highly beneficial advantages are realized.For example, by utilizing the process and catalyst composition of the present invention, syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene can be produced in high yields with low catalyst levels after relatively short polymerization times.Additionally and more significantly, since the catalyst composition of the present invention does not contain the highly volatile, toxic and flammable carbon disulfide, which is typically employed in some of the prior-art catalyst systems, the toxicity, objectionable smell, dangers and expense involved in the use of carbon disulfide are eliminated. Further, the catalyst composition of the present invention displays high catalytic activity in a wide range of solvents including nonhalogenated solvents, such as aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, which are environmentally preferred. In addition, the catalyst composition of the present invention is iron-based, and iron compounds are generally stable, non-toxic, inexpensive and readily available. Furthermore, the catalyst composition of the present invention is very versatile and capable of producing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene with various melting temperatures without the need to use a catalyst modifier as a fourth catalyst component. The catalyst composition of the present invention is comprised of the following components: (a) an iron-containing compound, (b) a cyclic hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organoaluminum compound. As the component (a) of the catalyst composition of the present invention, various iron-containing compounds can be utilized. It is generally advantageous to employ iron-containing compounds that are soluble in a hydrocarbon solvent such as aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons. Nevertheless, insoluble iron-containing compounds may merely be suspended in the polymerization medium to form the catalytically active species. Accordingly, no limitations should be placed on the iron-containing compounds to insure solubility. The iron in the iron-containing compounds employed in the catalyst composition of the present invention can be in various oxidation states including, but not limited to, the 0, +2, +3, and +4 oxidation states. It is preferable to use divalent iron compounds (also called ferrous compounds), wherein the iron is in the + 2 oxidation state, and trivalent iron compounds (also called ferric compounds), wherein the iron is in the + 3 oxidation state.Suitable types of iron-containing compounds that can be utilized in the catalyst composition of the present invention include, but are not limited to, iron carboxylates, iron P-diketonates, iron alkoxides or aryloxides, iron halides, iron pseudo-halides, and organoiron compounds.

As used herein, the term \"organoiron compounds\" refers to any iron compounds containing at least one covalent iron-carbon bond. Some specific examples of suitable organoiron compounds include bis(cyclopentadienyl)iron(II) (also called ferrocene), bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)iron(II) (also called decamethylferrocene), bis(pentadienyl)iron(II), bis(2,4-dimethylpentadienyl)iron(II), bis(allyf)dicarbonyliron(II), (cyclopentadienyl)(pentadienyl)iron(II), tetra(1-norbornyl)iron(IV), (trimethylenemethane)tricarbonyliron(II), bis(butadiene)carbonyliron(O), (butadiene)tricarbonyliron(0), and bis(cyclooctatetraene) iron (0). The component (b) of the catalyst composition of the present invention is a cyclic hydrogen phosphite. The cyclic hydrogen phosphite can be either a cyclic alkylene hydrogen phosphite or a cyclic aryiene hydrogen phosphite and may be represented by the following keto-enol tautomeric structures: II O~-~ O-~ H P~ R3 HO P\"~ R3 O Wherein R3is a divalent alkylene or arylene group or a divalent substituted alkylene or aryiene group preferably having from 2 or 6 to about 20 carbon atoms. The cyclic hydrogen phosphites exist mainly as the keto tautomer (shown on the left), with the enol tautomer (shown on the right) being the minor species. Either of the two tautomers or mixtures thereof can be used as the component (b) of the catalyst composition of the present invention.The equilibrium constant for the above-mentioned tautomeric equilibrium is dependent upon such factors as the temperature, the types of R3group, the type of solvent, and the like. Both tautomers may be associated in dimeric, trimeric or oligomeric forms by hydrogen bonding. The cyclic hydrogen phosphites employed in the catalyst composition of the present invention may be synthesized by the transesterification 3o reaction of an acyclic dihydrocarbyl hydrogen phosphite (usually dimethyl hydrogen phosphite or diethyl hydrogen phosphite) with an alkylene diol or an arylene diol. The procedure for such transesterification reaction is well known to those skilled in the art. Typically the transesterification reaction is carried out by heating a mixture of an acyclic dihydrocarbyl hydrogen phosphite and an alkylene diol or an arylene diol to effect the distillation of the alcohol (usually methanol or ethanol) eliminated in the transesterification reaction and leave the new-made cyclic hydrogen phosphite. Some specific examples of suitable cyclic alkylene hydrogen phosphites are 2-oxo-(2H)-5-butyl-5-ethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-5,5-dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-5-ethyl-5-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-5,5-diethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-5-methyl-5-propyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4-isopropyl-5,5-dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,6-dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4-propyl-5-ethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,5-dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, and the like.Mixtures of the above cyclic alkylene hydrogen phosphites may also be utilized.

Mixtures of the above cyclic arylene hydrogen phosphites may also be utilized. The catalyst composition of the present invention further comprises an organoaluminum compound as the component (c). As used herein, the term \"organoaluminum compound\" refers to any aluminum compound containing at least one covalent aluminum-carbon bond. It is generally advantageous to employ organoaluminum compounds that are soluble in the hydrocarbon polymerization medium. A preferred class of organoaluminum --.~ . ---compounds that can be utilized in the catalyst composition of the present invention are represented by the general formula AIRÅ‘X3.,, (n = 1, 2 or 3), wherein each R, which may be the same or different, is a hydrocarbyl radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, and allyl groups and preferably contains from 1, or the appropriate minimum number of carbon atoms (often 3 or 6) to form such group, up to 20 carbon atoms, and each X, which may be the same or different, is a hydrogen;halogen, preferably chlorine or bromine; or alkoxide or aryloxide group having 1 or 6 to 20 carbon atoms. Thus suitable types of organoaluminum compounds that can be utilized in the catalyst composition of the present invention inciude, but are not limited to, trihydrocarbylaluminum, dihydrocarbylaluminum hydride, hydrocarbylaluminum dihydride, dihydrocarbylaluminum halide, hydrocarbylaluminum dihalide, dihydrocarbylaluminum alkoxide, hydrocarbylaluminum dialkoxide, dihydrocarbylaluminum aryloxide, hydrocarbylaluminum diaryloxide, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Trihydrocarbylaluminum compounds are generally preferred. Some specific examples of suitable organoaluminum compounds that can be utilized in the catalyst composition of the present invention include trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, tri-n-propylaluminum, triisopropylaluminum, tri-n-hexylaluminum, tri-n-octylaluminum, tricyclohexylaluminum, triphenylaluminum, tri-p-tolylaluminum, tribenzylaluminum, diethylphenylaluminum, diethyl-p-tolylaluminum, diethylbenzylaluminum, ethyldiphenylaluminum, ethyldi-p-tolylaluminum, ethyldibenzylaluminum, diethylaluminum hydride, di-n-propylaluminum hydride, diisopropylaluminum hydride, di-n-butylaluminum hydride, diisobutylaluminum hydride, di-n-octylaluminum hydride, diphenylaluminum hydride, di-p-tolylaluminum hydride, dibenzylaluminum hydride, phenylethylaluminum hydride, phenyl-n-propylaluminum hydride, phenylisopropylaluminum hydride, phenyl-n-butylaluminum hydride, phenylisobutylaluminum hydride, phenyl-n-octylaluminum hydride, p-tolylethylaluminum hydride, p-tolyl-n-propylaluminum hydride, p-tolylisopropylaluminum hydride, p-tolyl-n-butylaluminum hydride, p-tolylisobutylaluminum hydride, p-tolyl-n-octylaluminum hydride, 5 benzylethylaluminum hydride, benzyl-n-propylaluminum hydride, benzylisopropylaluminum hydride, benzyl-n-butylaluminum hydride, benzylisobutylaluminum hydride, and benzyl-n-octylaluminum hydride, ethylaluminum dihydride, n-propylaluminum dihydride, isopropylaluminum dihydride, n-butylaluminum dihydride, isobutylaluminum dihydride, n-10 octylaluminum dihydride, dimethylaluminum chloride, diethylaluminum chloride, dimethylaluminum bromide, diethylaluminum bromide, dimethylaluminum fluoride, diethylaluminum fluoride, methylaluminum dichloride, ethylaluminum dichloride, methylaluminum dibromide, ethyialuminum dibromide, methylaluminum difluoride, ethylaluminum difluoride, methylaluminum sesquichloride, ethylaluminum sesquichloride, isobutylaluminum sesquichloride, dimethylaluminum methoxide, diethylaluminum methoxide, diisobutylaluminum methoxide, dimethylaluminum ethoxide, diethylaluminum ethoxide, diisobutylaluminum ethoxide, dimethylaluminum phenoxide, diethylaluminum phenoxide, diisobutylaluminum phenoxide, methylaluminum dimethoxide, ethylaluminum dimethoxide, isobutylaluminum dimethoxide, methylaluminum diethoxide, ethylaluminum diethoxide, isobutylaluminum diethoxide, methylaluminum diphenoxide, ethylaluminum diphenoxide, isobutylaluminum diphenoxide, and the like, and mixtures thereof. The catalyst composition of the present invention contains the above-described three components (a), (b), and (c) as the main components. In addition to the three catalyst components (a), (b), and (c), other catalyst components such as other organometallic compounds, which are known in the art, can also be added, if desired. The catalyst composition of the present invention has very high catalytic activity over a wide range of total catalyst concentrations and catalyst component ratios. The three catalyst components (a), (b), and (c) apparently interact to form the active catalyst species. Accordingly, the optimum concentration for any one catalyst component is dependent upon the concentrations of the other two catalyst components. While polymerization will occur over a wide range of catalyst concentrations and catalyst component ratios, the polymers having the most desirable properties are obtained within a narrower range of catalyst concentrations and catalyst component ratios. The molar ratio of the cyclic hydrogen phosphite to the iron-containing compound (P/Fe) in the catalyst composition of the present invention can be varied from about 0.5:1 to about 50:1, with a more preferred range being from about 1:1 to about 25:1 and a most preferred range being from about 2:1 to about 10:1. The molar ratio of the organoaluminum compound to the iron-containing compound (Al/Fe) can be varied from about 1:1 to about 100:1. However, a more preferred range of Al/Fe molar ratio is from about 3:1 to about 50:1, and a most preferred range is from about 5:1 to about 20:1. The total catalyst concentration in the polymerization mass depends on such factors as the purity of the components, the polymerization rate and conversion desired, the polymerization temperature, and the like.Accordingly, specific total catalyst concentrations cannot be definitively set forth except to say that catalytically effective amounts of the respective catalyst components should be used. Generally, the amount of the iron-containing compound used can be varied from about 0.01 to about 2 mmol per 100 g of 1,3-butadiene, with a more preferred range being from about 0.02 to about 1.0 mmol per 100 g of 1,3-butadiene and a most preferred range being from about 0.05 to about 0.5 mmol per 100 g of 1,3-butadiene. Certain specific total catalyst concentrations and catalyst component ratios that produce polymers having desired properties will be illustrated in the examples given to explain the teachings of the present invention. The three catalyst components of this invention may be introduced into the polymerization system in several different ways. Thus, the catalyst may be formed in situ by adding the three catalyst components to the monomer/solvent mixture in either a stepwise or simultaneous manner; the sequence in which the components are added in a stepwise manner is not critical but the components are preferably added in the sequence of iron-containing compound, cyclic hydrogen phosphite, and finally organoaluminum compound. Alternatively, the three catalyst components may also be premixed outside the polymerization system at an appropriate temperature (e.g., from about -20 C to about 80 C), and the resulting mixture then added to the polymerization system. Additionally, the catalyst may also be preformed, that is, the three catalyst components are premixed in the presence of a small amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer at an appropriate temperature (e.g., from about -20 C to about 80 C), prior to being charged to the main portion of the monomer/solvent mixture that is to be polymerized. The amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer which is used for the catalyst preforming can range from about 1 to about 500 moles per mole of the iron-containing compound, and preferably should be from about 4 to about 50 moles per mole of the iron-containing compound. In addition, the three catalyst components may also be introduced to the polymerization system using a two-stage procedure. This procedure involves first reacting the iron-containing compound with the organoaluminum compound in the presence of a small amount, as specified above, of 1,3-butadiene monomer at an appropriate temperature (e.g., from about -20 C to about 80 C).The resultant reaction mixture and the cyclic hydrogen phosphite are then added to the main portion of the monomer/solvent mixture in either a stepwise or simultaneous manner. Further, an alternative two-stage procedure may also be employed. This involves first reacting the iron-containing compound with the cyclic hydrogen phosphite at an appropriate temperature (e.g., from about -20 C to about 80 C) to form an iron complex, followed by adding the resultant iron complex and the organoaluminum compound to the monomer/solvent mixture in either a stepwise or simultaneous manner. When a solution of a catalyst component is prepared outside the polymerization system, the organic solvent usable for the catalyst component solution may be selected from aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, and mixtures of two or more of the above-mentioned hydrocarbons. Preferably, the organic solvent consists of at least one selected from benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, heptane and cyclohexane. As described hereinbefore, the iron-based catalyst composition of the present invention containing the three catalyst components (a), (b), and (c) exhibits a very high catalytic activity for the production of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Hence, the present invention further provides a process for producing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene by the use of the above-described iron-based catalyst composition. The production of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene according to the process of the present invention is put into practice by polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer in the presence of an iron-based catalyst composition comprising the foregoing three catalyst components (a), (b), and (c). As described above, there are available a variety of methods for bringing the three components of the catalyst composition of the present invention into contact with 1,3-butadiene monomer. In accordance with the process of the present invention, the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer may be carried out by means of bulk polymerization, wherein no solvents are employed. Such bulk --_ __ - - -~--polymerization can be conducted either in a condensed liquid phase or in a gas phase. Alternatively and more typically, the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer according to the process of the present invention is carried out in an organic solvent as the diluent. In such cases, a solution polymerization system may be employed in which both the 1,3-butadiene monomer to be polymerized and the polymer formed are soluble in the polymerization medium. Alternatively, a suspension polymerization system may be employed by choosing a solvent in which the polymer formed is insoluble. In 1o both cases, an amount of the organic solvent in addition to the organic solvent contained in the catalyst component solutions is usually added to the polymerization system. The additional organic solvent may be either the same as or different from the organic solvent contained in the catalyst component solutions. It is normally desirable to select an organic solvent that is inert with respect to the catalyst composition employed to catalyze the polymerization. Suitable types of organic solvents that can be utilized as the diluent include, but are not limited to, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, and aromatic hydrocarbons. Some representative examples of suitable aliphatic solvents include n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, 2o n-decane, isopentane, isohexanes, isoheptanes, isooctanes, 2,2-dimethylbutane, petroleum ether, kerosene, petroleum spirits, and the like. Some representative examples of suitable cycloaliphatic solvents include cyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane, methylcyclohexane, and the like. Some representative examples of suitable aromatic solvents include benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, diethylbenzene, mesitylene, and the like. Commercial mixtures of the above hydrocarbons may also be used. For environmental reasons, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic solvents are highly preferred. The concentration of the 1,3-butadiene monomer to be polymerized is not limited to a special range. However, generally, it is preferable that the concentration of the 1,3-butadiene monomer present in the polymerization medium at the beginning of the polymerization be in a range of from about 3% to about 80% by weight, but a more preferred range is from about 5%to about 50% by weight, and the most preferred range is from about 10%5 to about 30% by weight. In performing the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene according to the process of the present invention, a molecular weight regulator may be employed to control the molecular weight of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to be produced. As a result, the scope of the polymerization 10 system can be expanded in such a manner that it can be used for the production of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene ranging from an extremely high molecular weight polymer to a low molecular weight polymer. Suitable types of molecular weight regulators that can be utilized include, but are not limited to, accumulated diolefins such as allene and 1,2-butadiene; 15 nonconjugated diolefins such as 1,6-octadiene, 5-methyl-1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene, 3,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, 4-vinylcyclohexene, 1,4-pentadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-hexadiene, 1,6-heptadiene, 1,2-divinylcyclohexane, 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene, 5-methylene-2-norbornene, 5-vinyl-2-norbornene, dicyclopentadiene, and 1,2,4-trivinylcyclohexane; acetylenes such as acetylene, methylacetylene and vinylacetylene; and mixtures thereof. The amount of the molecular weight regulator used, expressed in parts per hundred parts by weight of the 1,3-butadiene monomer (phm) employed in the polymerization, is in the range of about 0.01 to about 10 phm, preferably in the range of about 0.02 to about 2 phm, and most preferably in the range of about 0.05 to about 1 phm. In addition, the molecular weight of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene product to be produced can also be effectively controlled by conducting the polymerization of the 1,3-butadiene monomer in the presence of hydrogen. In this case, the partial pressure of hydrogen is appropriately chosen within the range of about 0.01 to about 50 atmospheres. In accordance with the process of the present invention, the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene may be carried out as a batch process, on a semi-continuous basis, or on a continuous basis. In any case, the polymerization is desirably conducted under anaerobic conditions using an inert protective gas such as nitrogen, argon or helium, with moderate to vigorous agitation. The polymerization temperature employed in the practice of this invention may vary widely from a low temperature, such as -10 C or below, to a high temperature such as 100 C or above, with a preferred temperature range being from about 20 C to about 90 C. The heat of polymerization may be removed by external cooling, cooling by evaporation of the 1,3-butadiene monomer or the solvent, or a combination of the two methods. Although the polymerization pressure employed in the practice of this invention also may vary widely, a preferred pressure range is from about 1 atmosphere to about 10 atmospheres. The polymerization reaction of the present invention, on reaching a desired conversion, can be stopped by addition of a known polymerization terminator into the polymerization system to inactivate the catalyst system, followed by the conventional steps of desolventization and drying as are typically employed and are known to those skilled in the art in the production of conjugated diene polymers. Typically, the terminator employed to inactivate the catalyst system is a protic compound, which includes, but is not limited to, an alcohol, a carboxylic acid, an inorganic acid, and water or a combination thereof. An antioxidant such as 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol may be added along with, before or after addition of the terminator. The amount of the antioxidant employed is usually in the range of 0.2% to 1 % by weight of the polymer product. When the polymerization reaction has been stopped, the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene product may be isolated from the polymerization mixture by precipitation with an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol or by steam distillation of the solvent and the unreacted 1,3-butadiene monomer, followed by filtration. The product is then dried under a constant vacuum at a temperature within the range of about 25 C to about 100 C (preferably at about 60 C). The syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene made utilizing the catalyst composition of the present invention can have various melting temperatures, which are dependent upon the catalyst components and the component ratios. Desirably, the melting temperature varies from about 125 to about 175 C and more desirably from about 130 or 135 to about 165 or 170 C.The 1,2-linkage content is desirably from about 60 to about 90 or 95% and more desirably from about 70 to about 90 or 95%. The syndiotacticity is desirably from about 60 to about 90 or 95% and more desirably from about 70 to about 90 or 95%. The syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene produced with the catalyst composition of the present invention has many uses. It can be blended with various rubbers in order to improve the properties thereof. For example, it can be incorporated into elastomers in order to improve the green strength of those elastomers, particularly in tires. The supporting carcass (reinforcing carcass) of tires is particularly prone to distortion during tire building and curing procedures. For this reason the incorporation of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene into rubber compositions, which are utilized in the supporting carcass of tires, has particular utility in preventing or minimizing this distortion. In addition, the incorporation of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene into tire tread compositions can reduce the heat build-up and improve the wear characteristics of tires. The syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene product is also useful in the manufacture of food films and in many molding applications. The practice of the present invention is further illustrated by reference to the following examples, which however, should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. Parts and percentages shown in the examples are by weight unless otherwise indicated. Example 1 Dimethyl hydrogen phosphite (76.3 g, 0.693 mol) and 2-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propanediol (110.0 g, 0.687 mol) were mixed in a round-bottom reaction flask which was connected to a distillation head and a receiving flask. The reaction flask was kept under an atmosphere of argon and placed in a silicone oil bath maintained at 150 C. The transesterification reaction proceeded as indicated by the distillation of methanol. After about 2 hours of heating at the above temperature, the remaining methanol and any unreacted starting materials were removed by vacuum distillation at 135 Cand a pressure of 150 torr. The remaining crude product was distilled at 160 C and a pressure of 2 torr, yielding 2-oxo-(2H)-5-butyl-5-ethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane as a very viscous, colorless liquid (128.8 g, 0.625 mol, 91 % yield). The proper identity of the product was established by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analyses. 'H NMR data (CDCI3, 25 C, referenced to tetramethylsilane): 8 6.88 (doublet, 'JHP = 675 Hz, 1 H, H-P), 4.1 (complex, 4 H, OCH2), 0.8-1.8 (complex, 14 H, Et and Bu). 73P NMRdata (CDCI3, 25 C, referenced to external 85% H3P04): 8 3.88 (doublet of multiplets, 'JHP = 670 Hz). Example 2 An oven-dried 1 -liter glass bottle was capped with a self-sealing rubber liner and a perforated metal cap and purged with a stream of dry nitrogen gas. The bottle was charged with 64 g of hexanes and 186 g of a 1,3-butadiene/hexanes blend containing 26.9% by weight of 1,3-butadiene.The following catalyst components were added to the bottle in the following order: (1) 0.050 mmol of iron(II) 2-ethylhexanoate, (2) 0.20 mmol of 2-oxo-(2H)-5-butyl-5-ethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, and (3) 0.60 mmol of triisobutylaluminum. The bottle was tumbled for 5 hours in a water bath maintained at 50 C. The polymerization was terminated by addition of 10 mL of isopropanol containing 0.5 g of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. The polymerization mixture was added into 3 liters of isopropanol. The polymer was isolated by filtration and dried to a constant weight under vacuum at 60 C. The yield of the polymer was 48.1 g (96%). As measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the polymer had a melting temperature of 159 C. 'H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of the polymer indicated a 1,2-linkage content of 84.7% and a syndiotacticity of 81.5%. As determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), the polymer had a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of 641,000, a number average molecular weight (MÅ‘) of 346,000, and a polydispersity index (MW/Mn) of 1.9.

More particularly, the process of this invention comprises polymerizing 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement by using a chromium-based catalyst composition that is formed by combining a chromium-containing compound, a hydrogen phosphite, and an organomagnesium compound. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is a crystalline thermoplastic resin that has a stereoregular structure in which the side-chain vinyl groups are located alternately on the opposite sides in relation to the polymeric main chain. Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is a unique material that exhibits the properties of both plastics and rubber, and therefore it has many uses. For example, films, fibers, and various molded articles can be made by utilizing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. It can also be blended into and co-cured with natural and synthetic rubbers. Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene can be made by solution, emulsion, or suspension polymerization. Generally, syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene has a melting temperature within the range of about 195Â° C. to about 215Â° C., but due to processability considerations, it is generally desirable for syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to have a melting temperature of less than about 195Â° C. Because syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is insoluble in common solvents at normal polymerization temperatures, a common technical difficulty in the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is that the polymerization mixture is an extremely thick slurry at the commercially desirable polymer concentration off 10% to 25% by weight. This thick slurry becomes difficult to stir and transfer, thereby diminishing heat transfer efficiency and interfering with proper process control. Also, the slurry contributes to reactor fouling due to the undesirable build-up of insoluble polymer on the baffles, agitator blades, agitator shafts, and walls of the polymerization reactor. It is therefore necessary to clean the reactor on a regular basis, which results in frequent shutdowns of continuous processes and serious limitations of the run length of batch processes. The task of cleaning the fouled reactor is generally difficult and time-consuming. All of these drawbacks detrimentally affect productivity and the cost of operation. It would be advantageous to develop a method of synthesizing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene that avoids this frequent reactor fouling problem. Various transition metal catalyst systems based on cobalt, titanium, vanadium, chromium, and molybdenum for the preparation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene have been reported. The majority of these catalyst systems, however, have no practical utility because they have low catalytic activity or poor stereo selectivity, and in some cases they produce low molecular weight polymers or partially crosslinked polymers unsuitable for commercial use. The following two cobalt-based catalyst systems are well known for the preparation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene on a commercial scale: (1) a catalyst system containing cobalt bis(acetylacetonate), triethylaluminum, water, and triphenylphosphine (U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,498,963 and 4,182,813), and (2) a catalyst system containing cobalt tris(acetylacetonate), triethylaluminum, and carbon disulfide (U.S. Pat. No. 3,778,424). These cobalt-based catalyst systems also have serious disadvantages. The first cobalt catalyst system referenced above yields syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene having very low crystallinity. Also, this catalyst system develops sufficient catalytic activity only when halogenated hydrocarbon solvents are used as the polymerization medium, and halogenated solvents present toxicity problems. The second cobalt catalyst system referenced above uses carbon disulfide as one of the catalyst components. Because of its low flash point, obnoxious smell, high volatility, and toxicity, carbon disulfide is difficult and dangerous to use, and requires expensive safety measures to prevent even minimal amounts escaping into the atmosphere. Furthermore, the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene produced with this cobalt catalyst system has a very high melting temperature of about 200-210Â° C., which makes it difficult to process the polymer. Although the melting; temperature of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene produced with this cobalt catalyst system can be reduced by employing a catalyst modifier as a fourth catalyst component, the presence of this catalyst modifier has adverse effects on the catalyst activity and polymer yields. Accordingly, many restrictions are required for the industrial utilization of these cobalt-based catalyst systems. It is well known that the physical properties of rubbery elastomers can be improved by blending crystalline polymers therein. For example, incorporating syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene into rubber compositions that are utilized in the supporting carcass of tires greatly improves the green strength of those compositions. Also, incorporating syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene into tire tread compositions can reduce the heat build-up and improve the wear characteristics of tires. The green strength of synthetic rubbers such as cis-1,4-polybutadiene can also be improved by incorporating a small amount of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Blends of crystalline polymers and rubbery elastomers are typically prepared by standard mixing techniques. For example, these blends can be prepared by mixing or kneading and heat-treating a crystalline polymer and a rubbery elastomer by utilizing generally known mixing equipment such as a Banbury mixer, a Brabender mixer, an extruder, a kneader, or a mill mixer. These high-temperature mixing procedures, however, have certain drawbacks including high processing costs, polymer degradation and crosslinking, inadequate mixing, as well as various process limitations. Due to the high vinyl content of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene, polymer degradation and crosslinking is a particularly severe problem for mixing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene with elastomers at high temperatures. Attempts to polymerize 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement have been hampered by the same catalyst inefficiencies and toxicities mentioned above. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,379,889 teaches polymerizing 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement by using a catalyst system comprising a cobalt compound, a dialkylaluminum halide, carbon disulfide, and an electron donative compound. And, U.S. Pat. No. 5,283,294 teaches a similar process that employs a catalyst system comprising a cobalt compound, an organoaluminum compound, and carbon disulfide. These methods, however, are inferior because the catalyst systems that are employed suffer from the foregoing disadvantages. Therefore, it would be advantageous to develop a new and significantly improved process for producing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In general, the present invention provides a process for preparing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers, the process comprising the steps of (1) providing a mixture of a rubber cement and 1,3-butadiene monomer, and (2) polymerizing the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement by using a catalyst composition that is the combination of or the reaction product of ingredients comprising a chromium-containing compound, a hydrogen phosphite, and an organomagnesium compound. The present invention further provides a process for producing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers, the process comprising the steps of (1) providing a mixture of a rubber cement and 1,3-butadiene monomer, and (2) polymerizing the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement by using a catalyst composition that is formed by combining a chromium-containing compound, a hydrogen phosphite, and an organomagnesium compound. The present invention also provides a blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers prepared by a process comprising the steps of (1) providing a mixture of a rubber cement and 1,3-butadiene monomer, and (2) polymerizing the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement by using a catalyst composition that is the combination of or the reaction product of ingredients comprising a chromium-containing compound, a hydrogen phosphite, and an organomagnesium compound. Advantageously, the process of this invention directly provides blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers by synthesizing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement and thereby obviates the need for high-temperature mixing. Also, good dispersion of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene throughout rubbery elastomers can be easily and economically achieved. Significantly, the process of this invention eliminates the problems of high processing costs, polymer degradation and crosslinking, inadequate mixing, and various process limitations that are associated with high-temperature mixing procedures. The process of this invention also alleviates the problems of polymer cement thickness and reactor fouling that are associated with the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in the absence of a rubbery elastomer. In addition, the chromium-based catalyst system employed in this invention has very high catalytic activity and stereoselectivity for the syndiospecific polymerization of 1,3-butadiene. This activity and selectivity, among other advantages, allows syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to be produced in very high yields within a rubber cement. Additionally, this catalyst composition does not contain carbon disulfide, and therefore the toxicity, objectionable smell, dangers, and expense associated with the use of carbon disulfide are eliminated. Further, this catalyst composition is chromium-based, and chromium compounds are generally stable, inexpensive, relatively innocuous, and readily available. Furthermore, this catalyst composition has high catalytic activity in a wide variety of solvents including the environmentally-preferred nonhalogenated solvents such as aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS The present invention is generally directed toward a process for producing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers It has now been found that blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers can be directly produced by polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement by using a chromium-based catalyst composition. According to the process of the present invention, blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers are produced by the steps of: (1) providing a mixture of a rubber cement and 1,3-butadiene monomer, where the rubber cement includes at least one rubbery elastomer within an organic solvent and (2) polymerizing the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement by using an chromium-based catalyst composition. The chromium-based catalyst composition employed to synthesize the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene comprises (a) a chromium-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organomagnesium compound. Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention is directed toward the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement, other conjugated diene monomers can be polymerized by using the chromium-based catalyst composition to form conjugated diene polymers, preferably crystalline polymers, within a rubber cement. The rubber cement employed in this invention is a solution, preferably viscous, of at least one rubbery elastomer in an organic solvent. Virtually any type of rubbery elastomer can be used to prepare the rubber cement. Some specific examples of suitable rubbery elastomers include, but are not limited to, natural rubber, low-vinyl polybutadiene, cis-1,4-polybutadiene, amorphous 1,2-polybutadiene, low-vinyl polyisoprene, cis-1,4-polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, neoprene, ethylene-propylene copolymer rubber (EPR), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), styrene-isoprene rubber (SIR), styrene-isoprene-butadiene rubber (SIBR), styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SBS), styrene-butadiene block copolymer (SB), hydrogenated styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SEBS), hydrogenated styrene-butadiene block copolymer (SEB), styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer (SIS), styrene-isoprene block copolymer (SI), hydrogenated styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer (SEPS), hydrogenated styrene-isoprene block copolymer (SEP), polysulfide rubber, acrylic rubber, urethane rubber, silicone rubber, epichlorohydrin rubber, and the like. Mixtures of the above rubbery elastomers may also be used. These rubbery elastomers are well known and, for the most part, are commercially available. Also, those skilled in the art will be able to readily synthesize these rubbery elastomers by using techniques that are well known in the art. The rubber cement can be prepared by dissolving the above-mentioned rubbery elastomers in an organic solvent. When commercially available rubbery elastomers are employed to prepare the rubber cement, it may be necessary to purify the commercial products before use in order to remove residual water and additives that may become catalyst poisons in the subsequent step of polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement. In a preferred embodiment, the rubber cement is prepared in situ by polymerizing one or more appropriate monomers into rubbery elastomers in an organic solvent within the same reactor that is subsequently used for polymerizing 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. As noted above, many methods of synthesizing the above-mentioned rubbery elastomers are well known in the art. Preferably, however, the catalyst utilized in preparing the rubbery elastomers should not contain any ingredients that may interfere with the catalyst subsequently used in the step of polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement. Coordination catalyst systems, which are well known in the art, can be used for preparing the rubber cement of rubbery elastomers in situ. For example, lanthanide-based catalyst systems comprising a lanthanide compound such as a neodymium compound, an alkylating agent, and a source of halogen are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,297,667, 3,541,063, 3,794,604, which are incorporated herein by reference. These lanthanide-based catalyst systems are particularly useful for polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into cis-1,4-polybutadiene rubber. When a coordination catalyst such as the lanthanide-based system is used to synthesize rubbery elastomers, the catalyst is preferably inactivated by adding a terminator prior to proceeding with the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement. Suitable terminators include, but are not limited to, alcohols, carboxylic acids, inorganic acids, water, and mixtures thereof. It is not always necessary, however, to add a terminator to inactivate the catalyst system used to synthesize the rubbery elastomers since it is believed that the catalyst may be inactivated by the hydrogen phosphite component of the chromium-based catalysts composition that is subsequently used to synthesize the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. This has been found to be true in the case where a coordination catalyst that includes a neodymium compound, an alkylating agent, and a source of halogen ion is used to synthesize the rubbery elastomers. Also, anionic polymerization initiators, which are well known in the art, can be used for preparing the rubber cement of rubbery elastomers in situ. These initiators include, but are not limited to, organolithium initiators such as butyllithium or functional initiators such as lithium amide initiators, aminoalkyl lithium initiators, and organotin lithium initiators. Exemplary initiators are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,153,159, 5,268,439, 5,274,106, 5,238,893, 5,332,810, 5,329,005, 5,578,542, 5,393,721, 5,491,230, 5,521,309, 5,496,940, 5,574,109, 5,523,364, 5,527,753, and 5,550,203. These initiators are particularly useful for synthesizing conjugated diene elastomers or copolymers of conjugated diene monomers and vinyl-substituted aromatic monomers. When an anionic initiator is used to prepare the rubbery elastomers, it is preferred to quench the polymerization by adding a terminator prior to proceeding with the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement. Suitable terminators include, but are not limited to, metal halides, organic halides, alcohols, carboxylic acids, inorganic acids, sulfonic acid, water, and mixtures thereof. Metal halides, such as diethylaluminum chloride and ethylaluminum dichloride, are preferred, as are organic halides such as trimethylsilylchloride. Failure to quench the anionic polymerization may interfere with the formation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Other methods that are useful for synthesizing rubbery elastomers are known in the art, and the practice of this invention should not be limited to the selection of any particular elastomer, or to any particular method for synthesizing rubbery elastomers. Suitable monomers that can be polymerized to form the rubbery elastomers include conjugated diene monomers. Vinyl-substituted aromatic monomers can be copolymerized with one or more conjugated diene monomers to form rubbery elastomers. Some specific examples of suitable conjugated diene monomers that can be polymerized into rubbery elastomers include 1,3-butadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, 2-phenyl-1,3-butadiene, 2-ethyl-1,3-butadiene, isoprene, 1,3-pentadiene, 2-methyl-1,3-pentadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-pentadiene, 3-methyl-1,3-pentadiene, 4methyl-1,3-pentadiene, 1,3-hexadiene, 2,4-hexadiene, and 4,5-diethyl-1,3-octadiene. Some specific examples of suitable vinyl-substituted aromatic monomers that can be polymerized into rubbery elastomers include styrene, 4-methylstyrene, Î±-methylstyrene, 3,5-diethylstyrene, 4-ethylstyrene, 4-propylstyrene, 3,5-diethylstyrene, 2,4,6-trimethylstyrene, 4-dodecylstyrene, 2,3,4,5-tetraethylstyrene, 3-methyl-5-normal-hexylstyrene, 4-phenylstyrene, 2-ethyl-4-benzylstyrene, 3,5-diphenylstyrene, 1-vinylnaphthalene, 3-ethyl-1-vinylnaphthalene, 6-isopropyl-1-vinylnaphthalene, 6-cyclohexyl-1-vinylnapthalene, 7-dodecyl-2-vinylnaphthalene, and the like, and mixtures thereof. In preparing the rubber cement, it is normally desirable to select an organic solvent that is inert with respect to the catalyst systems that will be employed to synthesize the rubbery elastomers and the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Suitable types of organic solvents that can be utilized in preparing the rubber cement include, but are not limited to, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, and aromatic hydrocarbons. Some representative examples of suitable aliphatic solvents include n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, n-decane, isopentane, isohexanes, isoheptanes, isooctanes, 2,2-dimethylbutane, petroleum ether, kerosene, petroleum spirits, and the like. Some representative examples of suitable cycloaliphatic solvents include cyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane, methylcyclohexane, and the like. Some representative examples of suitable aromatic solvents include benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, diethylbenzene, mesitylene, and the like. Commercial mixtures of the above hydrocarbons may also be used. For environmental reasons, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic solvents are highly preferred. The concentration of the rubbery elastomers in the rubber cement varies depending on the types of the rubbery elastomers and organic solvent employed. It is generally preferred that the concentration of the rubbery elastomers be in a range of from about 5% to about 35% by weight of the rubber cement, more preferably from about 10% to 30% by weight of the rubber cement, and even more preferably from about 15% to about 25% by weight of the rubber cement. The foregoing rubber cement is then utilized as a polymerization medium for the stereospecific polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Thus, 1,3-butadiene monomer, a chromium-based catalyst composition, and optionally additional organic solvent are added to the rubber cement. The order in which the 1,3-butadiene monomer, the chromium-based catalyst composition, and the solvent are added to the rubber cement does not limit the scope of the invention, although it may be preferable to add the chromium-based catalyst composition, or at least an ingredient thereof, prior to the addition of the 1,3-butadiene monomer. The amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer added to the rubber cement is contingent upon the proportion of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene desired in the resultant polymer blend. The additional organic solvent can be selected from the group of the organic solvents mentioned above for the preparation of the rubber cement, and may be the same as or different from the organic solvent used in preparing the rubber cement. It should be noted that the addition of 1,3-butadiene monomer to the rubber cement may not be required in the case where 1,3-butadiene monomer is employed to prepare the rubbery elastomers and the polymerization is stopped before all the 1,3-butadiene is consumed, thereby providing the remaining 1,3-butadiene monomer for synthesizing the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene without the need to add additional 1,3-butadiene monomer. Chromium-based catalyst compositions useful for the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene are described in co-pending patent applications U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,201,080 and 6,117,956, which are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference. Generally, the preferred catalyst composition is formed by combining (a) a chromium-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organomagnesium compound. In addition to the three catalyst ingredients (a), (b), and (c), other organometallic compounds or Lewis bases that are known in the art can also be added, if desired. Various chromium-containing compounds or mixtures thereof can be employed as ingredient (a) of the chromium-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention. It is generally advantageous to employ chromium-containing compounds that are soluble in a hydrocarbon solvent such as aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbon-insoluble chromium-containing compounds, however, can be suspended in the polymerization medium to form the catalytically active species and are therefore also useful. The chromium atom in the chromium-containing compounds can be in various oxidation states ranging from 0 up to +6. It is preferable to use divalent chromium compounds (also called chromous compounds), wherein the chromium is in the +2 oxidation state, and trivalent chromium compounds (also called chromic compounds), wherein the chromium is in the +3 oxidation state. Suitable types of chromium-containing compounds that can be utilized include, but are not limited to, chromium carboxylates, chromium organophosphates, chromium organophosphonates, chromium organophosphinates, chromium carbamates, chromium dithiocarbamates, chromium xanthates, chromium Î²-diketonates, chromium alkoxides or aryloxides, chromium halides, chromium pseudo-halides, chromium oxyhalides, and organochromium compounds. Some specific examples of suitable chromium carboxylates include chromium formate, chromium acetate, chromium acrylate, chromiam methacrylate, chromium valerate, chromium gluconate, chromium citrate, chromium fumarate, chromium lactate, chromium maleate, chromium oxalate, chromium 2-ethylhexanoate, chromium neodecanoate, chromium naphthenate, chromium stearate, chromium oleate, chromium benzoate, and chromium picolinate.

Some specific examples of suitable organochromium compounds include tris(allyl)chromium, tris(methallyl)chromium, tris(crotyl)chromium, bis(cyclopentadienyl)chromium (also called chromocene), bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)chromium, bis(ethylbenzene)chromium (also called decamethylchromocene), bis(benzene)chromium, bis(ethylbenzene)chromium, bis(mesitylene)chromium, bis(pentadienyl)chromium, bis(2,4-dimethylpentadienyl)chromium, bis(allyl)tricarbonylchromium, (cyclopentadienyl)(pentadienyl)chromium, tetra(1-norbornyl)chromium (trimethylenemethane)tetracarbonylchromium, bis(butadiene)dicarbonylchromium, (butadiene)tetracarbonylchromium, and bis(cyclooctatetraene)chromium. Useful hydrogen phosphite compounds that can be employed as ingredient (b) of the chromium-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention are either acyclic hydrogen phosphites, cyclic hydrogen phosphites, or mixtures thereof. In general, acyclic hydrogen phosphites may be represented by the following keto-enol tautomeric structures: where R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, are mono-valent organic groups. Preferably, R1 and R2 are hydrocarbyl groups such as, but not limited to, alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, substituted cycloalkenyl, aryl, allyl, substituted aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, and alkynyl groups, with each group preferably containing from 1 carbon atom, or the appropriate minimum number of carbon atoms to form the group, up to 20 carbon atoms. These hydrocarbyl groups may contain heteroatoms such as, but not limited to, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus atoms. The acyclic hydrogen phosphites exist mainly as the keto tautomer (shown on the left), with the enol tautomer (shown on the right) being the minor species. The equilibrium constant for the above-mentioned tautomeric equilibrium is dependent upon factors such as the temperature, the types of R1 and R2 groups, the type of solvent, and the like. Both tautomers may be associated in dimeric, trimeric or oligomeric forms by hydrogen bonding. Either of the two tautomers or mixtures thereof can be employed as the ingredient (b) of the chromium-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention. Some representative and non-limiting examples of suitable acyclic hydrogen phosphites are dimethyl hydrogen phosphite, diethyl hydrogen phosphite, dibutyl hydrogen phosphite, dihexyl hydrogen phosphite, dioctyl hydrogen phosphite, didecyl hydrogen phosphite, didodecyl hydrogen phosphite, dioctadecyl hydrogen phosphite, bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) hydrogen phosphite, diisopropyl hydrogen phosphite, bis(3,3-dimethyl-2-butyl) hydrogen phosphite, bis(2,4-dimethyl-3-pentyl) hydrogen phosphite, di-t-butyl hydrogen phosphite, bis(2-ethylhexyl) hydrogen phosphite, dineopentyl hydrogen phosphate, bis(cyclopropylmethyl) hydrogen phosphite, bis(cyclobutylmethyl) hydrogen phosphite, bis(cyclopentylmethyl) hydrogen phosphite, bis(cyclohexylmethyl) hydrogen phosphite, dicyclobutyl hydrogen phosphite, dicyclopentyl hydrogen phosphite, dicyclohexyl hydrogen phosphite, dimethyl hydrogen phosphite, diphenyl hydrogen phosphite, dinaphthyl hydrogen phosphite, dibenzyl hydrogen phosphite, bis(1-naphthylmethyl)hydrogen phosphite, diallyl hydrogen phosphite, dimethallyl hydrogen phosphite, dicrotyl hydrogen phosphite, ethyl butyl hydrogen phosphite, methyl hexyl hydrogen phosphite, methyl neopentyl hydrogen phosphite, methyl phenyl hydrogen phosphite, methyl cyclohexyl hydrogen phosphite, methyl benzyl hydrogen phosphite, and the like. Mixtures of the above dihydrocarbyl hydrogen phosphites may also be utilized. In general, cyclic hydrogen phosphites contain a divalent organic group that bridges between the two oxygen atoms that are singly-bonded to the phosphorus atoms. These cyclic hydrogen phosphites may be represented by the following keto-enol tautomeric structures: where R3 is a divalent organic group. Preferably, R3 is a hydrocarbylene group such as, but not limited to, alkylene, cycloalkylene, substituted alkylene, substituted cycloalkylene, alkenylene, cycloalkenylene, substituted alkenylene, substituted cycloalkenylene, arylene, and substituted arylene groups, with each group preferably containing from 1 carbon atom, or the appropriate minimum number of carbon atoms to form the group, up to 20 carbon atoms. These hydrocarbylene groups may contain heteroatoms such as, but not limited to, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus atoms. The cyclic hydrogen phosphites exist mainly as the keto tautomer (shown on the left), with the enol tautomer (shown on the right) being the minor species. The equilibrium constant for the above-mentioned tautomeric equilibrium is dependent upon factors such as the temperature, the types of R3 group, the type of solvent, and the like. Both tautomers may be associated in dimeric, trimeric or oligomeric forms by hydrogen bonding. Either of the two tautomers or mixtures thereof can be employed as the ingredient (b) of the chromium-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention. The cyclic hydrogen phosphites may be synthesized by the transesterification reaction of an acyclic dihydrocarbyl hydrogen phosphite (usually dimethyl hydrogen phosphite or diethyl hydrogen phosphite) with an alkylene diol or an arylene diol. Procedures for this transesterification reaction are well known to those skilled in the art. Typically, the transesterification reaction is carried out by heating a mixture of an acyclic dihydrocarbyl hydrogen phosphite and an alkylene diol or an arylene diol. Subsequent distillation of the side-product alcohol (usually methanol or ethanol) that results from the transesterification reaction leaves the new-made cyclic hydrogen phosphite. Some specific examples of suitable cyclic alkylene hydrogen phosphites are 2-oxo-(2H)-5-butyl-5-ethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-5,5-dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-5-ethyl-5-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-5,5-diethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-5-methyl-5-propyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4-isopropyl-5,5-dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H) -4,6-dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4-propyl-5-ethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,5-dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, and the like. Mixtures of the above cyclic alkylene hydrogen phosphites may also be utilized. Some specific examples of suitable cyclic arylene hydrogen phosphites are 2-oxo-(2H)-4,5-benzo-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,5-(3\u2032-methylbenzo)-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,5-(4\u2032-methylbenzo)-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,5-(4\u2032-tert-butylbenzo)-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,5-naphthalo-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, and the like. Mixtures of the above cyclic arylene hydrogen phosphites may also be utilized. The chromium-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention further comprises an organomagnesium compound, which has been designated as ingredient (c). As used herein, the term \u0093organomagnesium compound\u0094 refers to any magnesium compound containing at least one magnesium-carbon bond. It is generally advantageous to employ organomagnesium compounds that are soluble in a hydrocarbon solvent. A preferred class of organomagnesium compounds that can be utilized as ingredient (c) of the chromium-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention is represented by the general formula MgR4 2, where each R4, which may be the same or different, is a mono-valent organic group, with the proviso that the group is attached to the magnesium atom via a carbon atom. Preferably, each R4 is a hydrocarbyl group such as, but not limited to, alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, substituted cycloalkenyl, aryl, allyl, substituted aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, and alkynyl groups, with each group preferably containing from 1 carbon atom, or the appropriate minimum number of carbon atoms to form the group, up to about 20 carbon atoms. These hydrocarbyl groups may contain heteroatoms such as, but not limited to, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus atom. Some specific examples of suitable dihydrocarbylmagnesium compounds that can be utilized include diethylmagnesium, di-n-propylmagnesiurn, diisopropylmagnesium, dibutylmagnesium, dihexylmagnesium, diphenylmagnesium, dibenzylmagnesium, and mixtures thereof. Dibutylmagnesium is particularly useful due to its availability and its solubility in aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon solvents. Another class of organomagnesium compounds that can be utilized as ingredient (c) of the catalyst composition utilized in this invention is represented by the general formula R5MgX, where R5 is a mono-valent organic group, with the proviso that the group is attached to the magnesium atom via a carbon atom, amd X is a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a carboxylate group, an alkoxide group, or an aryloxide group. Preferably, R5 is a hydrocarbyl group such as, but not limited to, alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, substituted cycloalkenyl, aryl, allyl, substituted aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, and alkynyl groups, with each group preferably containing from 1 carbon atom, or the appropriate minimum number of carbon atoms to form the group, up to about 20 carbon atoms. These hydrocarbyl groups may contain heteroatoms such as, but not limited to, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus atoms. Preferably, X is a carboxylate group, an alkoxide group, or an aryloxide group, with each group preferably containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Some suitable types of organomagnesium compounds that are represented by the general formula R5MgX include, but are not limited, hydrocarbylmagnesium hydride, hydrocarbylmagnesium halide, hydrocarbylmagnesium carboxylate, hydrocarbylmagnesium alkoxide, hydrocarbylmagnesium aryloxide, and mixtures thereof. Some specific examples of suitable organomagnesium compounds that are represented by the general formula R5MgX include methylmagnesium hydride, methylmagnesium hydride, butylmagnesium hydride, hexylmagnesium hydride, phenylmagnesium hydride, benzylmagnesium hydride, methylmagnesium chloride, ethylmagnesium chloride, butylmagnesium chloride, hexylmagnesium chloride, phenylmagnesium chloride, benzylmagnesium chloride, methylmagnesium bromide, ethylmagnesium bromide, butylmagnesium bromide, hexylmagnesium bromide, phenylmagnesium bromide, benzylmagnesium bromide, methylmagnesium hexanoate, ethylmagnesium hexanoate, butylmagnesium hexanoate, hexylmagnesium hexanoate, phenylmagnesium hexanoate, benzylmagnesium hexanoate, methylmagnesium ethoxide, ethylmagnesium ethoxide, butylmagnesium ethoxide, hexylmagnesium ethoxide, phenylmagnesium ethoxide, benzylmagnesium ethoxide, methylmagnesium phenoxide, ethylmagnesium phenoxide, butylmagnesium phenoxide, hexylmagnesium phenoxide, phenylmagnesium phenoxide, benzylmagnesium phenoxide, and the like, and mixtures thereof. The chromium-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention has very high catalytic activity for polymerizing 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene over a wide range of total catalyst concentrations and catalyst ingredient ratios. The polymers having the most desirable properties, however, are obtained within a narrower range of total catalyst concentrations and catalyst ingredient ratios. Further, it is believed that the three catalyst ingredients (a), (b), and (c) can interact to form an active catalyst species. Accordingly, the optimum concentration for any one catalyst ingredient is dependent upon the concentrations of the other catalyst ingredients. The molar ratio of the hydrogen phosphite to the chromium-containing compound (P/Cr) can be varied from about 0.5:1 to about 50:1, more preferably from about 1:1 to about 25:1, and even more preferably from about 2:1 to about 10:1. The molar ratio of the organomagnesium compound to the chromium-containing compound (Mg/Cr) can be varied from about 1:1 to about 50:1, more preferably from about 2:1 to about 30:1, and even more preferably from about 3:1 to about 20:1. As discussed above, the chromium-based catalyst composition utilized in the present invention is preferably formed by combining the three catalyst ingredients (a), (b), and (c). Although an active catalyst species is believed to result from this combination, the degree of interaction or reaction between the various ingredients or components is not known with any great degree of certainty. Therefore, it should be understood that the term \u0093catalyst composition\u0094 has been employed to encompass a simple mixture of the ingredients, a complex of the various ingredients that is caused by physical or chemical forces of attraction, a chemical reaction product of the ingredients, or a combination of the foregoing. The chromium-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention can be formed by combining or mixing the catalyst ingredients or components by using, for example, one of the following methods: First, the catalyst composition may be formed in situ by adding the three catalyst ingredients to the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and 1,3-butadiene monomer in either a stepwise or simultaneous manner. When adding the catalyst ingredients in a stepwise manner, the sequence in which the ingredients are added is not critical. Preferably, however, the organomagnesium compound is added first, followed by the chromium-containing compound, and then followed by the hydrogen phosphite. Second, the three catalyst ingredients may be pre-mixed outside the polymerization system at an appropriate temperature, which is generally from about âˆ’20Â° C. to about 80Â° C., and the resulting catalyst composition is then added to the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and 1,3-butadiene monomer. Third, the catalyst composition may be pre-formed in the presence of 1,3-butadiene monomer. That is, the three catalyst ingredients are pre-mixed in the presence of a small amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer at an appropriate temperature, which is generally from about âˆ’20Â° C. to about 80Â° C. The amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer that is used for the catalyst pre-forming can range from about 1 to about 500 moles per mole of the chromium-containing compound, more preferably from about 4 to about 100 moles per mole of the chromium-containing compound, and even more preferably from about 10 to about 50 moles per mole of the chromium-containing compound. The resulting catalyst composition is then added to the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and the remainder of the 1,3-butadiene monomer that is to be polymerized. Fourth, as a further variation, the catalyst composition can also be formed by using a two-stage procedure. The first stage involves combining the chromium-containing compound and the organomagnesium compound in the presence of a small amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer at an appropriate temperature, which is generally from about âˆ’20Â° C. to about 80Â° C. In the second stage, the foregoing reaction mixture and the hydrogen phosphite are charged in either a stepwise or simultaneous manner to the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and the remainder of the 1,3-butadiene monomer that is to be polymerized. Fifth, an alternative two-stage procedure may also be employed. A chromium-ligand complex is first formed by pre-combining the chromium-containing compound and the hydrogen phosphite compound. Once formed, this chromium-ligand complex is then combined with the organomagnesium compound to form the active catalyst species. The chromium-ligand complex can be formed separately or in the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and the 1,3-butadiene monomer that is to be polymerized. This complexation reaction can be conducted at any convenient temperature at normal pressure, but for an increased rate of reaction, it is preferred to perform this reaction at room temperature or above. The time required for the formation of the chromium-ligand complex is usually within the range of about 10 minutes to about 2 hours after mixing the chromium-containing compound with the hydrogen phosphite compound. The temperature and time used for the formation of the chromium-ligand complex will depend upon several variables including the particular starting materials and the solvent employed. Once formed, the chromium-ligand complex can be used without isolation from the complexation reaction mixture. If desired, however, the chromium-ligand complex may be isolated from the complexation reaction mixture before use. Sixth, the three catalyst ingredients may be added to the rubber cement prior to or simultaneously with the addition of 1,3-butadiene monomer. When a solution of the chromium-based catalyst composition or one or more of the catalyst ingredients is prepared outside the polymerization system as set forth in the foregoing methods, an organic solvent or carrier is preferably employed. Useful solvents include hydrocarbon solvents such as aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons. Non-limiting examples of aromatic hydrocarbon solvents include benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, diethylbenzene, mesitylene, and the like. Non-limiting examples of aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents include n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, n-decane, isopentane, isohexanes, isopentanes, isooctanes, 2,2-dimethylbutane, petroleum ether, kerosene, petroleum spirits, and the like. And, non-limiting examples of cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon solvents include cyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane, methylcyclohexane, and the like. Commercial mixtures of the above hydrocarbons may also be used. For environmental reasons, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic solvents are highly preferred. The foregoing organic solvents may serve to dissolve the catalyst composition or ingredients, or the solvent may simply serve as a carrier in which the catalyst composition or ingredients may be suspended. The production of blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers according to this invention is accomplished by polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer within the rubber cement by using a catalytically effective amount of the foregoing chromium-based catalyst composition. To understand what is meant by a catalytically effective amount, it should be understood that the total catalyst concentration to be employed in the polymerization mass depends on the interplay of various factors such as the purity of the ingredients, the polymerization temperature, the polymerization rate and conversion desired, and many other factors. Accordingly, a specific total catalyst concentration cannot be definitively set forth except to say that catalytically effective amounts of the respective catalyst ingredients should be used. Generally, the amount of the chromium-containing compound used can be varied from about 0.01 to about 2 mmol per 100 g of 1,3-butadiene monomer, more preferably from about 0.02 to about 1.0 mmol per 100 g of 1,3-butadiene monomer, and even more preferably from about 0.05 to about 0.5 mmol per 100 g of 1,3-butadiene monomer. In performing the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement, a molecular weight regulator may be employed to control the molecular weight of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to be produced. As a result, the scope of the polymerization system can be expanded in such a manner that it can be used for the production of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene having a wide range of molecular weights. Suitable types of molecular weight regulators that can be utilized include, but are not limited to, Î²-olefins such as ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, and 1-octene; accumulated diolefins such as alkene and 1,2-butadiene; nonconjugated diolefins such as 1,6-octadiene, 5-methyl-1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene, 3,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadiene, 1,4-cylohexadiene, 4-vinylcyclohexene, 1,4-pentadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-hexadiene, 1,6-heptadiene, 1,2-divinylcyclohexane, 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene, 5-methylene-2-norbornene, 5-vinyl-2-norbornene, dicyclopentadiene, and 1,2,4-trivinylcyclohexane; acetylenes such as acetylene, methylacetylene and vinylacetylene; and mixtures thereof. The amount of the molecular weight regulator used, expressed in parts per hundred parts by weight of the 1,3-butadiene monomer (phm), is from about 0.01 to about 10 phm, more preferably from about 0.02 to about 2 phm, and even more preferably from about 0.05 to about 1 phm. The molecular weight of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to be produced can also be effectively controlled by conducting the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer in the presence of hydrogen gas. In this case, the partial pressure of hydrogen gas is preferably from about 0.01 to about 50 atmospheres. The polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement may be carried out as a batch process, a continuous process, or even a semi-continuous process. In the semi-continuous process, 1,3-butadiene monomer is intermittently charged as needed to replace that monomer already polymerized. In any case, the polymerization is desirably conducted under anaerobic conditions by using an inert protective gas such as nitrogen, argon or helium, with moderate to vigorous agitation. The polymerization temperature may vary widely from a low temperature, such as âˆ’10Â° C. or below, to a high temperature such as 100Â° C. or above, with a preferred temperature range being from about 20Â° C. to about 90Â° C. The heat of polymerization may be removed by external cooling, cooling by evaporation of the 1,3-butadiene monomer or the solvent, or a combination of the two methods. Although the polymerization pressure employed may vary widely, a preferred pressure range is from about 1 atmosphere to about 10 atmospheres. Once a desired conversion is achieved, the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement can be stopped by adding a polymerization terminator that inactivates the chromium-based catalyst system. Typically, the terminator employed to inactivate the catalyst system is a protic compound, which includes, but is not limited to, an alcohol, a carboxylic acid, an inorganic acid, water, or a combination thereof An antioxidant such as 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol may be added along with, before or after the addition of the terminator. The amount of the antioxidant employed is usually in the range of 0.2% to 1% by weight of the polymer product. When the polymerization reaction has been stopped, the blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and the rubbery elastomer can be recovered from the polymerization mixture by utilizing conventional procedures of desolventizaton and drying. For instance, the blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and the rubbery elastomer may be isolated from the polymerization mixture by coagulation of the polymerization mixture with an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol, or by steam distillation of the solvent and the unreacted 1,3-butadiene monomer, followed by filtration. The product is then dried to remove residual amounts of solvent and water. The polymer blend produced is a highly dispersed blend of crystalline syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in the rubbery elastomer. Advantageously, the chromium-based catalyst composition employed in this invention can be manipulated to vary the characteristics of the syndiotactic 1,2polybutadiene in the polymer blend. Namely, the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in the polymer blend made by the process of this invention can have various melting temperatures, molecular weights, 1,2-linkage contents, and syndiotacticities, all of which are dependent upon the selection of the catalyst ingredients and the ingredient ratios. The blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers produced with the process of this invention have many uses. For example, these blends can be utilized in rubber compositions that are used to manufacture the supporting carcass, innerliner, and tread of tires. The blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers are also useful in the manufacture of films and packaging materials and in many molding applications. In order to demonstrate the practice of the present invention, the following examples have been prepared and tested as described in the Examples disclosed hereinbelow. The examples should not, however, be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. The claims will serve to define the invention. EXAMPLES Example 1 In this experiment, a highly dispersed blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and low-vinyl polybutadiene was prepared by polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in the presence of a low-vinyl polybutadiene rubber cement. The low-vinyl polybutadiene rubber cement was prepared by charging 449 g of hexanes, 911 g of a 1,3-butadiene/hexanes blend containing 22.40% by weight of 1,3-butadiene, and 0.64 mL of 1.60 M n-butyllithium in hexanes to a two-gallon stainless-steel reactor. The polymerization was carried out at 65 Â° C. for 6 hours. The catalyst was inactivated by the addition of 1.02 mL of 1.0 M diethylaluminum chloride. The conversion of the 1,3-butadiene monomer to low-vinyl polybutadiene was determined to be essentially 100% by measuring, the weight of the polymer recovered from a small portion of the rubber cement. After the low-vinyl polybutadiene rubber cement produced above was cooled to room temperature, 1048 g of hexanes and 2126 g of a 1,3-butadiene/hexane blend containing 22.4% by weight of 1,3-butadiene were added to the rubber cement. The polymerization of the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was initiated by the addition of 17.5 mL of 1.0 M of dibutylmagnesium in heptane, 32.7 mL of 0.0582 M chromium(III) 2-ethylhexanoate in hexanes, and 35.8 mL of 0.266 M bis(2-ethylhexyl) hydrogen phosphite in hexanes. The polymerization was conducted at 35 Â° C. for 4 hours. The polymerization was stopped by the addition of 3 mL of isopropanol diluted with 50 mL of hexanes. The polymerization mixture was added into 10 liters of isopropanol containing 12 g of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. The polymer blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and low-vinyl polybutadiene was isolated by filtration and dried to a constant weight under vacuum at 60 Â° C. The yield of the polymer blend was 637 g. The conversion of the 1,3-butadiene monomer to the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was calculated to be 91%. As determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the polymer blend had a glass transition temperature of âˆ’93Â° C. resulting from the low-vinyl polybutadiene and a melting temperature of 153Â° C. resulting from the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Example 2 In this experiment, the same procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that the polymerization of the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the low-vinyl polybutadiene rubber cement was initiated by the addition of 21.4 mL of 1.0 M dibutylmagnesium in heptane, 40.9 mL of 0.0582 M chromium(III) 2-ethylhexanoate in hexanes, and 61.7 mL of 0.193 M of 2-oxo-(2H)-5-butyl-5-ethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane in cyclohexane. After work-up of the polymerization mixture, a highly dispersed blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and low-vinyl polybutadiene was obtained. The yield of the polymer blend was 618 g. The conversion of the 1,3-butadiene monomer to the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was calculated to be 87%. As determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the polymer blend had a glass transition temperature of âˆ’93 Â° C. resulting from the low-vinyl polybutadiene and a melting temperature of 141 Â° C. resulting from the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Example 3 In this experiment, a highly dispersed blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and high cis-1,4-polybutadiene was prepared by polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a high cis-1,4-polybutadiene rubber cement. The high cis-1,4-polybutadiene rubber cement was prepared by charging 449 g of hexanes, 911 g of a 1,3-butadiene/hexanes blend containing 22.4% by weight of 1,3-butadiene, 9.0 mL of 0.68 M triisobutylaluminum in hexanes, 0.41mL of 1.0 M diethylaluminum chloride, and 0.39 mL of 0.520 M neodymium(III) neodecanoate in cyclohexane to a two-gallon stainless-steel reactor. The polymerization was carried out at 80 Â° C. for 5 hours. The conversion of the 1,3-butadiene monomer to high cis-1,4-polybutadiene was determined to be 96% by measuring the weight of the polymer recovered from a small portion of the rubber cement. After the high cis-1,4-polybutadiene rubber cement produced above was cooled to room temperature, 1048 g of hexanes and 2126 g of a 1,3-butadiene/hexanes blend containing 22.4% by weight of 1,3-butadiene were added to the rubber cement. The polymerization of the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement was initiated by the addition of 17.1 mL of 1.0 M dibutylmagnesium in heptane, 32.7 mL of 0.0582 M chromium(III) 2-ethylhexanoate in hexanes, and 35.8 mL of 0.266 M of bis(2-ethylhexyl) hydrogen phosphite in hexanes. The polymerization was conducted at 35Â° C. for 4 hours. The polymerization was stopped by the addition of 3 mL of isopropanol diluted with 50 mL of hexanes. The polymerization mixture was added into 10 liters of isopropanol containing 12 g of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. The resulting blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and high cis-1,4-polybutadiene was isolated by filtration and dried to a constant weight under vacuum at 60Â° C. The yield of the polymer blend was 647 g. The conversion of the 1,3-butadiene monomer to the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was calculated to be 93%. As determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the polymer blend had a glass transition temperature of âˆ’103Â° C. and a melting temperature of âˆ’7Â° C. resulting from the high cis-1,4-polybutadiene, and a melting temperature of 152Â° C. resulting from the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Example 4 In this experiment, the same procedure of Example 3 was repeated except that the polymerization of the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the high cis-1,4-polybutadiene rubber cement was initiated by the addition of 21.4 mL of 1.0 M dibutylmagnesium in heptane, 40.9 mL of 0.0582 M chromium(III) 2-ethylhexanoate in hexanes, and 61.7 mL of 0.193 M of 2-oxo-(2H)-5-butyl-5-ethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane in cyclohexane. After work-up of the polymerization mixture, a highly dispersed blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and high cis-1,4-polybutadiene was obtained. The yield of the polymer blend was 632 g. The conversion of the 1,3-butadiene monomer to the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was calculated to be 90%. As determined toy differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the polymer blend had a glass transition temperature of âˆ’104Â° C. and a melting temperature of âˆ’8Â° C. resulting from the high cis-1,4-polybutadiene, and a melting temperature of 140Â° C. resulting from the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. In Examples 1-4, after the polymer blend cement was removed from the reactor, visual inspection of the interior of the reactor revealed that the reactor was relatively clean with minimal fouling. Comparative Example 5 In this experiment, the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was conducted in the absence of a rubber cement. In the procedure used, a two-gallon stainless-steel reactor was charged with 2408 g of hexanes, 2126 g of a 1,3-butadiene/hexanes blend containing 22.4% by weight of 1,3-butadiene, 17.1 mL of 1.0 M dibutylmagnesium in heptane, 32.7 mL of 0.0582 M chromium(III) 2-ethylhexanoate in hexanes, and 35.8 mL of 0.266 M bis(2-ethylhexyl) hydrogen phosphite in hexanes. The polymerization was conducted at 35Â° C. for 4 hours. The polymerization was stopped by the addition of 3 mL of isopropanol diluted with 50 mL of hexanes. The polymerization mixture was removed from the reactor and added into 10 liters of isopropanol containing 12 g of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol, visual inspection of the interior of the reactor revealed that severe reactor fouling had occurred. In particular, the blades and shafts of the agitator were covered with large chunks of agglomerated polymer particles, and the reactor wall was coated with a thick polymer film. Due to reactor fouling, the reactor had to be opened to recover the remaining polymer inside the reactor. The total yield of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was 461 g (97%). As determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the polymer had a melting temperature of 153Â° C. This comparative experiment shows that reactor fouling can be a serious problem in the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in the absence of a rubber cement. Examples 1-4 show that by utilizing the process of the present invention, the problem of reactor fouling associated with the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene can be greatly reduced. Although the present invention has been described in the above examples with reference to particular means, materials and embodiments, it would be obvious to persons skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made, which fall within the scope claimed for the invention as set out in the appended claims. The invention is therefore not limited to the particulars disclosed and extends to all equivalents within the scope of the claims."

No Drawing. Filed Oct. 13, 1971, Ser. No. 189,005 Int. Cl. 008g 39/10, 51/04, 51/18 US. Cl. 260-862 14 Claims ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE The addition of certain 1,2-polybutadiene resins to unsaturated polyesters improves impact resistance and toughness with no loss of heat distortion temperature. This invention relates to improved unsaturated polyester molding compositions. More particularly, this invention relates to certain unsaturated polyester molding compositions containing certain 1,2-polybutadiene resins which have improved impact resistance. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Alkyd molding compositions are well known and are prepared from unsaturated polyesters of unsaturated aliphatic dibasic carboxylic acids and glycols admixed with fillers, lubricants, stabilizers, and peroxide curing agents. Alkyd molding compositions are inexpensive and can be readily fabricated by high speed, automatic equipment for a variety of products including automotive ignition components, switch gear components, and the like. However, alkyd resins have one disadvantage, inadequate toughness, which has limited their large scale use for example in the automotive industry, wherein molded parts must be able to withstand multi-step handling, machining, and processing with no long-term loss of strength. High performance plastics such as phenolics are presently preferred by the industry. However, phenolics have poor electrical properties, particularly at elevated temperatures, whereas alkyd resins have excellent electrical properties. Thus an alkyd resin having improved toughness would be highly desirable for molded parts for electrical and other components. DISCUSSION OF THE PRIOR ART The addition of a rubbery component to a thermoplastic resin to improve impact resistance and toughness is known, but addition of such materials to thermoplastic molding compositions does not always impart added toughness. US. Pat. 3,231,634 to Wismer et al., teaches that unsaturated polyester resins can be modified by blending with a rubbery polymer to impart cracking resistance. The rubbery polymers added are polymers of conjugated dienes, such as butadiene, isoprene, haloprene, and copolymers thereof. However, the cured compositions of Wismer et a1. exhibit a marked decrease in heat distortion temperature. This is unacceptable since the heat distortion temperature determines the temperature at which the composition can be molded without deformation of the article upon ejection from the mold. If the molding temperature is too low, the molding cycle time must be increased, with corresponding increase in cost. Further, the heat distortion temperature determines the temperature at which the mechanical and electrical properties of the cured resin deteriorate rapidly, thus defining its upper use temperature. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide alkyd resin compositions having improved toughness. It is a further object to provide molding compositions \"ice which can be formed and cured into tough molded articles having high heat distortion temperatures and excellent electrical properties. Further objects will become apparent from the following detailed description thereof. It has been discovered that molding compositions of certain unsaturated polyesters, containing certain 1,2-polybutadiene resins can be utilized in alkyd molding compositions which, when cured, exhibit greatly improved impact resistance and toughness and have high heat distortion temperatures. The alkyd molding compositions of the invention are derived from an unsaturated polyester having a high fumarate functionality of at least about 55%, preferably 60-78%, by weight of the polyester, a glycol and optionally an aromatic dibasic carboxylic acid, admixed with from 3-20% by weight of the molding composition, preferably 5-15% by weight, of a l,2-'polybutadiene resin having a high 1,2-vinyl content of at least 70%, preferably 70-95 by weight of the butadiene polymer and conventional fillers, catalysts, inhibiters, and the like. Conventional cross-linking monomers containing a CH =C group can also be added. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The unsaturated polyesters useful in the invention are the reaction products of fumaric and/or maleic acid or their anhydrides, with a glycol, and when required, also an aromatic dibasic acid. The unsaturated polyesters must have a fumarate functionality, that is, the percentage by weight of unsaturated acid calculated as fumaric acid, of at least 55% and preferably from 60-78%. When the polyester has a high fumarate functionality, e.g., over about no aromatic dibasic acid need be added. When a lower functionality resin is desired, an amount of aromatic acid required to dilute the functionality to the desired level is also added. Suitable aromatic dibasic acids include phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, trimellitic acid, and the like, or their anhydrides. Isophthalic acid is preferred for high impact materials. Glycols suitable for preparing the polyesters include aliphatic diols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,2-, 1,3-, 1,4-butane diols, 1,6-hexane diol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, and the like; and aromatic diols, such as bis[4-(2-hydroxy)propoxyphenyl]dime-thylmethane and the like. Mixtures of glycols can also be employed. The unsaturated polyester generally contains an inhibiter to prevent premature curing or cross-linking. Suitable inhibiters are well known and include hydroquinone, mono-t-butylhydroquinone, t-butyl catechol, tetrachloroquinone, and the like. The 1,2-polybutadienes suitable for use in the invention must have a 1,2-vinyl content of at least about 70%, preferably 70-95%, by weight of the resin. Polybutadienes having a molecular weight of about 100,000-300,000 are 'preferred in the invention. However, lower molecular weight resins having a molecular weight in the range 10,000-100,000, can also be employed when admixed, in amounts up to 50% by weight of the 1,2-polybutadiene, with 1,4-polybutadiene having a high molecular weight, i.e. over 100,000. However, the presence of excessive amounts of 1,4-polybutadiene has a deleterious effect on the heat distortion temperature of the resultant cured polyesters. The molding compositions of the invention are prepared by admixing the unsaturated polyesters, the 1,2- polybutadiene resin (both as hereinabove described), and other conventional ingredients such as monomers, if employed, catalysts, fillers, and pigments. manner as will be known to one skilled in the art. The manner and order of mixing of the ingredients of the present molding compositions are not critical and do not alfect the properties of the resultant cured polymer. temperature (hereinafter HDT) according to ASTM test D648, Izod Impact according to ASTM test D256-56, and flexural strength and flexural modulus according to ASTM test D790.

        "text": "Description FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a pneumatic tire with a component containing syndiotactic polybutadiene. The invention particularly relates to a tire with a tread configured with an outer cap rubber layer and an internal underlying rubber layer where the underlying rubber layer is comprised of such syndiotactic polybutadiene-containing rubber composition or a tire with a sidewall apex of such syndiotactic polybutadiene-containing rubber composition. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Pneumatic tires are often provided with a circumferential tread of a cap/base configuration comprised of an outer ground-contacting tread cap rubber layer with a tread running surface and an internal rubber layer underlying said tread cap rubber layer such as, for example, a tread base rubber layer or intermediate rubber layer between the outer tread cap rubber layer and tread base rubber layer. Such tire constructions are well known to those having skill in such art. The outer tread cap rubber layer is typically comprised of a rubber composition which provides resistance to tread wear during tire service, stiffness for tire handling purposes and traction for the road surface. Such typically desirable properties are well known to those having skill in such art. The internal tread underlying rubber layer is typically comprised of a rubber composition which is less stiff than the outer tread cap rubber layer and less hysteretic to promote a reduced internal heat buildup during tire service to thereby provide a transition zone between the outer tread cap rubber layer and the tire carcass. Such typically desirable properties for a tire underlying tread base or intermediate rubber layer are well known to those having skill in such art. However, some tires are intended to be provided for use as high performance tires which are expected to provide a challenge of enhanced (improved) handling and cornering ability. For this invention it is desired to increase a tire component's stiffness while substantially maintaining its hysteresis (e.g. tire component as a tread's internal underlying tread rubber layer or as a sidewall's apex). For the tire tread, it is desired to promote its stiffness to promote tire handling yet substantially maintain, without significantly increasing, the rubber's hysteresis property, or tendency of internal heat buildup during the tire's service. While it is well known that a rubber composition's stiffness can normally be increased by increasing its reinforcing filler content, for example by increasing its rubber reinforcing carbon black content, it is also known that such methodology of increasing rubber stiffness through reinforcing filler increase can also be expected to significantly increase the rubber composition's hysteresis and thereby increase its internal heat buildup during tire service with a resultant usually unwanted extent of temperature increase. It is therefore desired to evaluate significantly reducing the rubber reinforcing carbon black content below an otherwise desirable rubber reinforcement level to thereby promote a reduction of a rubber composition's hysteresis and attendant internal heat buildup combined with promoting stiffness of the tire tread base rubber layer by other means. For such purpose, it is desired to evaluate use of a syndiotactic-1,2-polybutadiene for a rubber composition for a tire component (e.g. tread base rubber layer or apex) to promote stiffness for the rubber composition while significantly reducing its rubber reinforcing carbon black content to promote a reduction of the rubber composition's hysteresis. It is recognized that syndiotactic polybutadiene has been used in various rubber compositions for various tire components such as for example, tire carcass and innerliner components. For example, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,307,850 and 6,956,093. It is believed that use of syndiotactic polybutadiene for a tread base rubber composition combined with a significant reduction of rubber reinforcing carbon black content is novel and a departure from past practice and that such combination is warranted for evaluation. In the description of this invention, the term \u0093phr\u0094 where used means \u0093parts of material by weight per 100 parts by weight of rubber\u0094. The terms \u0093rubber\u0094 and \u0093elastomer\u0094 may be used interchangeably unless otherwise indicated. The terms \u0093rubber composition\u0094 and \u0093compound\u0094 may be used interchangeably unless otherwise indicated. A volume electrical resistivity, sometimes referred to herein as electrical resistivity, may suitably be determined by DIN 53682 or ASTM Method D257-92 and reported herein as ohm-cm. SUMMARY AND PRACTICE OF THE INVENTION In accordance with this invention, a pneumatic rubber tire is provided having a component comprised of a rubber composition comprised of, based on parts by weight per 100 parts by weight rubber (phr): (A) elastomer(s) comprised of: (1) about 10 to about 80, alternately from about 10 to about 60, phr of syndiotactic-1,2-polybutadiene, and (2) about 90 to about 20, alternately from about 90 to about 40, phr of at least one additional diene-based elastomer comprised of at least one of polymers and copolymers of at least one of isoprene and 1,3-butadiene and copolymers of styrene and at least one of isoprene and 1,3-butadiene, (B) up to about 40 phr of filler reinforcement comprised of: (1) carbon black, or (2) amorphous, synthetic silica (e.g. precipitated silica), or (3) combination of carbon black and (said) precipitated silica, or (4) platelets of exfoliated clay (e.g. exfoliated montmorillonite clay) in an amount of up to about 10 phr and clay (unexfoliated clay such as, for example, kaolinite clay) in an amount of up to about 40 phr; wherein said filler reinforcement comprised of at least one said carbon black and precipitated silica may optionally additionally contain at least one of said platelets of exfoliated clay in an amount of up to about 10 phr and said clay (unexfoliated clay) in an amount of up to about 40 phr; wherein said carbon black based filler is comprised of at least one of: (5) rubber reinforcing carbon black (C1) having a DBP value in a range of from about 62 to about 150 cc/100 g and an Iodine value in a range of from about 20 to about 205 m2/g in an amount of from about 5 to about 40, alternately from about 5 to about 30, phr, (6) electrically conductive carbon black (C2) having a DBP value in a range of from about 175 to about 570 cc/100 g and an Iodine value in a range of from about 180 to about 650 m2/g in an amount of from about 5 to about 20, alternately from about 5 to about 10, phr, (7) graphene platelets (C3) comprised of at least partially exfoliated graphite in an amount of up to about 15 phr, and (8) carbon nanotubes (C4) in an amount of up to about 10 phr; wherein, in one embodiment, said precipitated silica is present in an amount of up to about 40 phr, for example from 5 to about 40 phr. In one embodiment, said carbon black based filler is primarily distributed in a preferential elastomer, or, alternatively, a preferential continuous elastomer phase of the rubber composition by blending a primary portion of the carbon based filler with an individual elastomer, particularly where said elastomer comprises greater than 50 percent of the elastomers in the rubber composition. Such preferential distribution may be accomplished, for example, by mixing at least a primary portion of said carbon black filler with an individual elastomer, or rubber composition containing an individual elastomer prior to blending the remaining elastomer(s) with the rubber composition which sometimes may be referred to a process of sequential mixing or Y-mixing. In one embodiment, for example, said filler reinforcement is comprised of from about 5 to about 40, alternately from about 5 to about 20, phr of a combination of said rubber reinforcing carbon black and said electrically conductive carbon black and, alternately said precipitated silica. In one embodiment, for example, said filler reinforcement is comprised of a combination of said rubber reinforcing carbon black and said graphene platelets and, alternately, said precipitated silica. In one embodiment, said filler reinforcement is comprised of said rubber reinforcing carbon black and said carbon nanotubes and, alternately, said precipitated silica. In one embodiment, said filler reinforcement is comprised of said electrically conductive carbon black and said graphene platelets and, alternately, said precipitated silica. In one embodiment, said filler reinforcement is comprised of said electrically conductive carbon black and said carbon nanotubes and, alternately, said precipitated silica. In one embodiment, said pneumatic rubber tire contains a circumferential rubber tread of a cap/base configuration comprised of an outer cap rubber layer containing a tread running surface and an underlying rubber layer (underlying said outer tread cap rubber layer) wherein said component is said underlying rubber layer. In one embodiment, said pneumatic tire is comprised of a circumferential rubber tread, supporting carcass, two spaced apart beads and sidewalls connecting said beads to said tread, wherein said component is an apex extending from said bead(s) into said sidewall. In embodiment, it is desired that the total of said carbon based filler reinforcement content is limited to a maximum of about 40, alternately a maximum of about 30, phr to promote a lower hysteresis for the rubber composition as reflected in the rubber composition's rebound value. In practice, the syndiotactic-1,2-polybutadiene desirably has a melting point (MP) in a range of from about 80Â° C. to about 200Â° C., alternately in a range from about 100Â° C. to about 170Â° C. or from about 130Â° C. to about 140Â° C. In one embodiment, it is desired that the melting point of said syndiotactic-1,2-polytuadiene is lower than the mixing temperature for the rubber composition which may, for example, be in a range of from about 150Â° C. to about 180Â° C. Such polymer melting point (Mp) may be determined, for example, as minimum endotherm values from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves as conventionally used and understood by those having skill in such art. The syndiotactic-1,2-polybutadiene (SPBD) for the purposes of this invention has at least 70 percent, and usually at least about 90 percent, of its repeating units in a 1,2-configuration, namely a syndiotactic 1,2-configuration, (e.g. 1,2-bonds). It is envisioned that the SPBD can be prepared, for example, in an inert organic solvent such as, for example, utilizing a procedure described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,901,868 or in an aqueous medium utilizing a process described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,506,031 and such patents are incorporated herein in their entirely as a reference for such SPBD methods of preparation. In practice, the SPBD may be introduced into the rubber, for example, in a powder form. Alternately, the SPBD may be pre-mixed (e.g. as a powder form of the SPBD) with an elastomer for the rubber composition as a masterbatch thereof which may contain, for example, from about 10 to about 15 phr of the syndiotactic polybutadiene for which the masterbatch is then blended with the rubber composition. In other words, for example, the SPBD may be in a form of a powder at the time that it is mixed with the rubber composition or may be introduced as a pre-formed rubber masterbatch thereof. The SPBD powder may, for example, have a particle size of an average diameter of less than about 250 microns (e.g. less than a bout 60 mesh size), alternately less than about 105 microns (e.g. less than about 140 mesh size). The SPBD powder may be mixed with the rubber composition at a mixing temperature of the rubber composition, for example, which is at least as high as the melting point of the SPBD being used, or alternatively, at a rubber mixing temperature which is lower than the melting of the SPBD being used. During the mixing process, the mixing of the SPBD with the rubber composition is typically carried out in an internal rubber mixer, on a mill mixer, or in some other suitable type of mixing device. Reference to rubber reinforcing carbon blacks may be found, for example, as being listed in The Vanderbilt Rubber Handbook (1978), Page 417, according to their ASTM designations with associated Iodine values which may range, for example, from about 20 to about 205 m2/g and DBP values which may range, for example, from 62 to about 150 m1/100 g, respectively. Representative of carbon blacks that are considered as being electrically conductive, and suitable for said second carbon black (C2), where one or more of the following indicated \u0093N\u0094 ASTM designated carbon blacks might also be considered as being a rubber reinforcing carbon black (C1), are, for example, N134 carbon black having an Iodine number of about 142 m2/g and a nitrogen surface area of about 131 m2/g, N220 carbon black having an Iodine number of about 121 m2 g and a nitrogen surface area of about 106 m2 g, N472 carbon black having an Iodine number of about 270 m2 g and a nitrogen surface area of about 254 m2 g and a DBP value of about 254 m1/100 g, Sidcon\u0099 159 from Sid Richardson Corporation, Printex XE2-B\u0099 and Corex XE\u0099 from Orion Engineered Carbons understood to have nitrogen surface area of about 560 m2/g and DPB value of about 400 m1/100 g, Black Pearls 2000\u0099 and Vulcan XC 72\u0099 from Cabot Corporation, understood to have a Iodine number (value) of about 253 m2/g and DBP value of about 254 m1/100 g; 23MM\u0099 from the 3M Company understood to have a nitrogen surface area of about 558 m2/g and a DBP value of about 300 m1/100 g; and Ketchen Blacks as EC300J\u0099, EC600J\u0099 and EC600JD\u0099 understood to have nitrogen surface areas of about 1040, 800 and 1000 m2/100 g, respectively, and DBP values of about 550, 360 and 500 ml/g, respectively. It is readily seen that the electrically conductive carbon blacks, in general, differ significantly from the previously indicated rubber reinforcing carbon blacks. Other conventional compounding ingredients may also, of course, be included in the rubber composition including, for example, zinc oxide, zinc stearate, various processing aids as well as sulfur or sulfur containing compounds together with one or more sulfur cure accelerators. The following Examples are provided to illustrate the invention and is not intended limit the scope in which it can be practiced. Unless otherwise indicated, parts and percentages are by weight. EXAMPLE I Rubber samples were prepared to evaluate use of syndiotactic-1,2-polybutadiene in rubber compositions for promoting stiffness for a rubber composition. The basic rubber composition (amounts rounded) for these Examples is reported in the following Table 1 with parts and percentages, where appropriate, by weight unless otherwise indicated.

Control rubber Sample A was prepared with its elastomer components being a combination of natural rubber and polybutadiene rubber A without the syndiotactic polybutadiene. Comparative rubber Sample B was prepared with its elastomer components being a combination of natural rubber and polybutadiene rubber B without the syndiotactic polybutadiene. Experimental rubber Samples C and D were prepared with their elastomer components being a combination of natural rubber, cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubber B together with 10 and 20 phr of the syndiotactic-1,2-polybutadiene, respectively. The rubber compositions were prepared by blending the ingredients in an internal rubber mixer in a series of sequential mixing steps while sheeting out the rubber mixtures and cooling to a temperature below 40Â° C. between mixing steps. The sequential mixing steps were comprised of a non-productive mixing step(s), (NP), followed by a productive mixing step (P), (in which sulfur and sulfur cure accelerators and optionally retarder were added). Such sequential mixing steps are well known to those having skill in such art. The following Table 2 reports cure behavior and various physical properties of rubber Samples A through D based upon the formulation of Table 1. The rubber samples were sulfur cured, where appropriate, for about 11 minutes at about 170Â° C.

From Table 2 it can be observed that Experimental rubber Samples C and D with the addition of 10 and 20 phr of the syndiotactic polybutadiene, respectively, were significantly stiffer in terms of 23Â° C. Shore A hardness, 100 percent modulus and Storage modulus (G\u2032) while their hysteresis in terms of rebound values were substantially the same. On this basis, an evaluation to evaluate an effect of significantly reducing the rubber reinforcing carbon black content or possibly use of an inclusion of precipitated silica reinforcement would appear to be appropriate.

It was concluded from these results that it would be interesting to evaluate eliminating the rubber reinforcing carbon black and possibly adding precipitated silica as a reinforcing filler (with coupling agent) and possibly reducing or eliminating the cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubber to seek to further increase the stiffness of the rubber composition while reducing its hysteresis.

Its rebound value at 100Â° C. increased and its ARES tan delta decreased, therefore indicating a lower hysteresis. (B) For rubber Sample J which was provided with 40 phr of syndiotactic polybutadiene and with 8 phr of an electrically conductive carbon black, it is observed that rubber Sample J exhibited substantially greater stiffness in terms of its 100 percent modulus, Shore A hardness, modulus and ARES storage modulus (G\u2032).

Its rebound value at 100Â° C. increased an its AREA tan delta value decreased, therefore indicating a lower hysteresis. (D) For rubber Sample L which was provided with an increased 80 phr of syndiotactic polybutadiene and with 8 phr of an electrically conductive carbon black, it is observed that rubber Sample L exhibited an even greater stiffness in terms of its 100 percent modulus, Shore A hardness, and ARES storage modulus (G\u2032).

It is thereby concluded that the inclusion of the syndiotactic polybutadiene effectively increased the stiffness of the rubber composition and provided a lower hysteresis as compared to Control rubber Samples A and B.

Filed Mar. 12, 1973, Ser. No. 340,128 Claims priority, application Japan, Sept. 11, 1972, 7/ 90,468 Int. Cl. C08c 9/04; C08f 29/14 US. Cl. 260- 11 Claims ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE This invention relates to a rubber composition having improved properties. More particularly, this invention relates to a rubber composition comprising 1,2-polybutadiene and a conjugated diene-based rubbery polymer and possessing an extremely high green strength, eX- cellent extrudability and moldability and a tendency to yield a vulcanizate of high hardness and of high resistance to ozone and weathering. Rubbers for general uses which have hitherto been commercially available, particularly conjugated dienebased rubbers, have excellent rubbery properties such as low heat build-up, reduced permanent set, and yet high impact resilience, but, on the other hand, have such defects as low green strength, inferior extrudability and moldability, and inferior resistance of the vulcanizate to ozone and weathering. In order to improve the green strength, there have hitherto been proposed processes whereby a resinous polymer such as polyethylene is blended or chemicals such as nitroso compounds and phthalic anhydride are incorporated. However, problems still remain in physical properties of the 'vulcanizate in the former process and in economical aspect in the latter process. 1,2-Polybutadiene shows greatly different physical properties, depending upon its crystallinity. It is possible, therefore, to vary the physical properties of 1,2-polybutadienes from rubbery to resinous by properly controlling the crystallinity. The method of controlling the crystallinity has already been established in US. Pat. 3,498,963 and 3,522,332. The thus obtained 1,2-polybutadiene having a 1,2-addition units content of 70% or higher and crystallinity of 5% or higher has properties intermediate between rubber and resin. As a result of an extensive study, the present inventors have found that by incorporating the above-mentioned 1,2-polybutadiene into a conjugated diene-based rubbery polymer there can be obtained a rubber composition which is greatly high in green strength, is excellent in extrudability, moldability and surface appearance after treatment, and tends to yielda vulcanizate possessing high hardness and high resistance to ozone, without imparing the characteristics of the conjugated diene-based 3,827,991 Patented Aug. 6, 1974 \"ice rubbery polymer, such as low heat build-up, low permanent set, high impact resilience. This invention provides a rubber composition consisting essentially of 3 to 50% by weight of 1,2-polybutadiene having a 1,2-addition units content of or higher and crystallinity of 5% or higher, and 97 to 50% by weight of at least one conjugated diene-based rubbery polymer selected from the group consisting of styrenebutadiene copolymer rubber, polyisoprene rubber, natural rubber, acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer rubber and polychloroprene rubber. The 1,2-polybutadiene to be used in this invention is that having a 1,2-addition units content of 70% or higher, preferably or higher, and crystallinity of 5% or higher, preferably 5 to 50%, especially preferably 5 to 30% in view of the ease of incorporation. Its molecular weight can be selected from a wide range, so both liquid and solid polymers may be used though it is preferable to use a polymer having an intrinsic viscosity [1;] of 0.7 dL/g. or higher (determined in toluene at 30 C.). When the 1,2-addition units content is below 70%, the tensile strength and tear strength will be markedly low. When the crystallinity is below 5%, it is impossible to obtain the result expected in this invention. In this invention, the conjugated diene-based rubbery polymers may be used alone or in combination of two or more. In this invention, the method of blending the aforesaid 1,2-polybutadiene with a conjugated diene-based rubbery polymer has no particular restriction. Both solutions of the respective components can be mixed with each other followed by removing the solvents, or alternatively, both components in the form of solids can be blended with each other by a conventional method, for example, by means of roll, Banburys mixer or kneader to obtain a similar result. The amount of 1,2- polybutadiene to be blended is 3 to 50%, preferably 5 to 50% by weight. If the amount exceeds 50% by weight, the heat build-up permanent set or impact resilience will be adversely affected, while if it is less than 3% by weight, no substantial merit of this invention will be obtained. It is, of course, possible to further incorporate into the rubber composition of this invention at least one conventional compounding ingredient, such as reinforcing agents, fillers, extender oils, pigments, vulcanizing agents, vulcanizing accelerators, vulcanizing activators, antioxidants, ultraviolet absorbers, blowing agents, odorants, softening agents, etc. The rubber composition obtained according to this invention possesses a high green strength, excellent extrudability, and excellent moldability and in addition, a vulcanizate therefrom has a high hardness and excellent resistance to ozone and weathering. The invention is further explained below in more detail with reference to examples which are not by way of limitation but by way of illustration. The characteristic properties of 1,2-polybutadienes used in the examples are as follows: The micro-structure of the above-noted polybutadienes was measured by the infrared absorption spectrum method of D. Morero et a1. [Chimie et Ind., 41, 758 (1959)]. The crystallinity was determined by the density measurement method in which the following equation was used: where d density of the specimen measured at 20 C., d density of the crystalline region, d density of the amorphous region, and X: crystallinity in percent. The value of d used was that of the crystalline 1,2- polybutadiene calculated by Natta from X-ray experiments to be 0.963 [L. G. Natta, J. Polymer Sci., 20, 251 (1956)]. The value of d, used was 0.892, or the density of the 1,2-polybutadiene obtained by the synthesizing process proposed in US. Pat. 3,498,963.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Conventionally, polymer compositions are widely used for domestic articles and industrial goods as plastic or rubber materials. The color tone of these types of polymer compositions is considered to be one of the important quality items of polymer compositions as it may possibly affect the quality of the final products. Factors for deterioration of color tone of polymer compositions include, for example, discoloration caused by heating or heat generation due to shearing stress during the working process of polymer compositions, as well as discoloration due to storage condition of products from polymer composition materials. The polymer composition comprises a phenol compound as a stabilizer in order to improve the problem of color tone. Such a polymer composition is produced, for example, by the method described in Patent Document 1. Recently, polymerization conditions in the production of polymers has become severe, accompanied by improvement in the productivity of polymers.

When the content of the component (c) is less than 0.01 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the polymer, it is difficult for the component to sufficiently exert its inhibiting effect on the discoloration of the polymer composition. When the component (c) is contained in excess of 2.0 parts by weight in the polymer composition, on the other hand, inhibiting effect on the discoloration of polymer composition hardly improves any more. The polymer is preferably at least one member selected from the group consisting of conjugated diene polymers, ethylene/Î±-olefin copolymers, cycloolefin polymers, and their hydrogenated products, from the point of view that the inhibiting effect of each of the aforementioned components on the discoloration of polymer compositions is facilitated in the above polymers. The conjugated diene polymers comprise homopolymers of a conjugated diene, and copolymers of a conjugated diene with a monomer which is copolymerizable with the conjugated diene. The conjugated dienes include, for example, 1,3-butadiene, 4-alkyl substituted-1,3-butadiene, and 2-alkyl substituted-1,3-butadiene.

The cycloolefins in the polymers of a cycloolefin(s) include, for example, cyclopentene, cyclohexene, norbornene, and cyclohexadiene. The polymer is more preferably a polymer which is polymerized using a catalyst containing a transition metal or an alkali metal, as the inhibiting effect of each of the components (a) and (b) on the discoloration of the polymer compositions is particularly high. The polymers which are polymerized using a catalyst containing a transition metal include, for example, cis-1,4-polybutadiene polymerized using a cobalt catalyst, and syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene by solution polymerization using a cobalt-phosphine catalyst. The polymers which are polymerized using a catalyst containing an alkali metal include, for example, a styrene/butadiene block copolymer and a styrene/isoprene block copolymer, anionically polymerized using an alkyl lithium catalyst. Further, the polymers may be obtained also, for example, by using a catalyst, a titanocene compound or a nickel compound containing a transition metal as a hydrogenating catalyst for hydrogenating a styrene/butadiene block copolymer or a styrene/isoprene block copolymer. The polymers are more preferably cis-1,4-polybutadiene and syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene from the viewpoint that the discoloration of the polymer composition caused by cobalt can be effectively inhibited. Further, from the viewpoint of especially effectively inhibiting the discoloration resulting from solution polymerization at a high temperature, it is particularly preferable that the polymer is syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. The content of 1,2-bond in syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is preferably not less than 70%, more preferably not less than 75%, and most preferably not less than 90%, as the inhibiting effect of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene on the discoloration of the polymer composition is more effectively exerted. The polymer composition may contain, for example, processing oil and various fillers as other additives. The polymer composition is produced through adding step and desolvating step. In adding step, the components (a) and (b), as well as the component (c) and the like according to need, are added to a polymer solution containing the polymer and the solvent thereof. The polymer solution is a solution in which the polymerization reaction has been stopped by the addition of a polymerization terminator. In adding step, each component is mixed with the polymer solution by a known method. For this mixing procedure, a roll, a banbury, or an extruder, for example, may be employed. The order of the addition of each component to the polymer solution is not specified, and thus the components (a) to (c) and other additives may be, for example, simultaneously added to the polymer solution. In desolvating step, the solvent in the polymer solution, to which each of the aforementioned components has been added, is removed to obtain the polymer composition containing the polymer and the each component. To the desolvation procedure, a known method such as a direct removing method, a steam stripping method, and in addition, a method of removing the solvent by heated roll may be applied. The polymer composition may be utilized in the application in which special importance is placed on the color tone, for example, in toys, footwear, and household sundries, and in addition, as a modifier for plastics. This polymer composition may be used as a material for various molded articles, for example, after being pelletized. In this case, the polymer composition may provide pellets with good color tone, as the discoloration of the pellets is inhibited by each of the components (a) and (b) being contained in the polymer composition. Further, the discoloration of pellets during storage can be inhibited. The pellets are molded into various molded articles after the combining of pigments or the like according to need. In this case also, the discoloration of pellets due to melting by heat, or shearing stress may be inhibited as the polymer composition contains each of the components (a) and (b). The effects exerted by the embodiment of the present invention will be described bellow. In the polymer composition in this embodiment, the discoloration of the polymer composition may be effectively inhibited by the component (a) which is a particular phosphorus compound being contained in addition to the component (b), wherein the component (a) is supposed to act synergistically with the component (b) to affect polymers. Further, this polymer composition may make desired color to stand out in a case where it is used after the coloration, as the polymer composition has a good color tone. As a result, aesthetic properties of domestic articles and industrial products obtained from the polymer composition may be improved. Further, the utility value of the polymer composition is very high, as the polymer composition hardly harms the color tone of plastics when it is used as a resin modifier in the mixture with another resin through the use of the properties of the polymer. The polymer composition in this embodiment contains, in addition, preferably the component (c). In a case where the polymer composition is composed in this way, the discoloration of the polymer composition may be better inhibited. In the polymer composition in this embodiment, the polymer is preferably at least one member selected from the group consisting of conjugated diene polymers, ethylene/Î±-olefin copolymers, cycloolefin polymers, and their hydrogenated products. As the inhibiting effect of each of the components (a) and (b) on the discoloration is easily exerted in these polymers, higher inhibiting effect on discoloration may be obtained. Particularly, syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene, which is a conjugated diene polymer, may exert an excellent inhibiting effect on the discoloration. In the polymer composition in this embodiment, the polymer is preferably a polymer which is polymerized using a catalyst containing a transition metal or an alkali metal. In a case where the polymer composition is composed in this way, the discoloration of the polymer composition due to a trace amount of residual transition metal or alkali metal in it may be inhibited. The process for producing the polymer composition in this embodiment comprises adding step wherein each of the components (a) and (b) and the like are added to the polymer solution after the termination of solution polymerization, and desolvating step wherein the solvent contained in the polymer solution is removed. In the case of this process for production, the discoloration of the polymer composition may be effectively inhibited as the discoloration of the polymer during a desolvating step may be inhibited. EXAMPLES In the next paragraphs, the above-stated embodiment will be more specifically explained by referring to examples and a comparative example. In the following description, \u0093%\u0094 is by weight unless otherwise indicated. <Preparation of a Catalyst Solution> In a 30 ml pressure bottle, 2.7 ml of 1% cobalt chloride-triphenylphosphine complex solution in methylene chloride, and 12.4 ml of 1% methylaluminoxane (calculated on atomic Al basis) solution in toluene were placed under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen, and then stirred for 10 minutes to obtain a cobalt catalyst solution. <Synthesis of a Polymer> In a 500 ml pressure bottle, 60 ml of 1,3-butadiene, 348 ml of cyclohexane and 1.51 ml of the aforementioned cobalt catalyst solution were placed under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen, and then polymerization reaction was carried out under the condition in a thermostat bath at 60Â° C. and for 60 minutes. After that, the polymer solution containing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was prepared by stopping the polymerization reaction by further adding 1 ml of isopropanol as a terminator. After the solvent in the polymer solution was removed with an evaporator, 27 g of the polymer was obtained (yield: 75%). Example 1 With the obtained polymer solution, 0.270 g of 10% 2-ethylhexyl acid phosphate solution in cyclohexane was combined. The amount of combined 2-ethylhexyl acid phosphate as the component (a) corresponds to 0.1 g per 100 g of the polymer.

After that, the polymer solution was prepared by removing the solvent in the polymer solution with an evaporator. Examples 2 to 9 In Examples 2 to 9, the polymer compositions were prepared in the same way as Example 1 except that the kind and the combination ratio of each component were altered as shown in Table 1.

Next, a 5 mm square was cut out from the sheet of each example with scissors, and then placed in a cell with a diameter of 50 mm. After that, YI (yellow index) value, value L, value a and value b of the sheet were measured in conformity with JIS K 7105-1981 (Test method for the optical properties of plastics) by a reflection method using a SM color computer (Model: SM-3, made by SUGA TEST INSTRUMENTS Co., Ltd.). These results are shown together in Table 1. <(II) Color Tone After Heat Treatment> The polymer composition in each example was pressed with a pressing machine to be formed into a sheet (diameter: 50 mm, thickness: 2 mm). Next, sheets of each example were allowed to stand under an atmosphere of air at 170Â° C. in a gear oven for 6 hours. After that, each sheet was taken out from the gear oven, and allowed to stand at room temperature (25Â° C.) for an hour. Then, value YI, value L, value a and value b of the sheet were measured in conformity with JIS K 7105-1981 (Test method for the optical properties of plastics) by a reflection method using a SM color computer (Model: SM-3, made by SUGA TEST INSTRUMENTS CO., LTD.). These results are shown together in Table 1. As evidenced by the results in Table 1, which show that value YI of each example immediately after the preparation indicates a lower value than that of Comparative example 1 immediately after the preparation, it is understood that the discoloration of the polymer compositions of each example during the preparation was inhibited, thereby the polymer compositions demonstrating an excellent color tone. The values YI of Examples 1 to 8 immediately after the preparation indicate lower values than that of Example 9 immediately after the preparation. This fact shows that incorporating the component (c) into the polymer composition enables improving the inhibition of the discoloration of the polymer composition. Further, the value YI of each example after heat treatment indicates a lower value than that of Comparative example 1 after heat treatment. This fact shows that the discoloration during forming step also may be inhibited in the polymer composition of each example. The value YI of Example 8 after heat treatment indicates a lower value than those of the other examples after heat treatment. This fact shows that incorporating 4,6-bis(octylthiomethyl)-o-cresol as the component (b) into the polymer composition enables improving the inhibition of the discoloration of the polymer composition."

        "text": "Description FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed toward a process for producing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers. More particularly, the process of this invention comprises polymerizing 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement by using a catalyst composition that is formed by combining (a) a molybdenum-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organoaluminum compound. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is a crystalline thermoplastic resin that has a stereoregular structure in which the side-chain vinyl groups are located alternately on the opposite sides in relation to the polymeric main chain. Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is a unique material that exhibits the properties of both plastics and rubber, and therefore it has many uses. For example, films, fibers, and various molded articles can be made by utilizing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. It can also be blended into and co-cured with natural and synthetic rubbers. Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene can be made by solution, emulsion, or suspension polymerization. Generally, syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene has a melting temperature within the range of about 195Â° C. to about 215Â° C., but due to processability considerations, it is generally desirable for syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to have a melting temperature of less than about 195Â° C. Because syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is insoluble in common solvents at normal polymerization temperatures, a common technical difficulty in the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is that the polymerization mixture is an extremely thick slurry at the commercially desirable polymer concentration of 10% to 25% by weight. This thick slurry becomes difficult to stir and transfer, thereby diminishing heat transfer efficiency and interfering with proper process control. Also, the slurry contributes to reactor fouling due to the undesirable build-up of insoluble polymer on the baffles, agitator blades, agitator shafts, and walls of the polymerization reactor. It is therefore necessary to clean the reactor on a regular basis, which results in frequent shutdowns of continuous processes and serious limitations of the run length of batch processes. The task of cleaning the fouled reactor is generally difficult and time-consuming. All of these drawbacks detrimentally affect productivity and the cost of operation. It would be advantageous to develop a method of synthesizing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene that avoids this frequent reactor fouling problem. Various transition metal catalyst systems based on cobalt, titanium, vanadium, chromium, and molybdenum for the preparation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene have been reported. The majority of these catalyst systems, however, have no practical utility because they have low catalytic activity or poor stereoselectivity, and in some cases they produce low molecular weight polymers or partially crosslinked polymers unsuitable for commercial use. The following two cobalt-based catalyst systems are well known for the preparation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene on a commercial scale: (1) a catalyst system containing cobalt bis(acetylacetonate), triethylaluminum, water, and triphenylphosphine (U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,498,963 and 4,182,813), and (2) a catalyst system containing cobalt tris(acetylacetonate), triethylaluminum, and carbon disulfide (U.S. Pat. No. 3,778,424). These cobalt-based catalyst systems also have serious disadvantages. The first cobalt catalyst system referenced above yields syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene having very low crystallinity. Also, this catalyst system develops sufficient catalytic activity only when halogenated hydrocarbon solvents are used as the polymerization medium, and halogenated solvents present toxicity problems. The second cobalt catalyst system referenced above uses carbon disulfide as one of the catalyst components. Because of its low flash point, obnoxious smell, high volatility, and toxicity, carbon disulfide is difficult and dangerous to use, and requires expensive safety measures to prevent even minimal amounts escaping into the atmosphere. Furthermore, the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene produced with this cobalt catalyst system has a very high melting temperature of about 200-210Â° C. which makes it difficult to process the polymer. Although the melting temperature of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene produced with this cobalt catalyst system can be reduced by employing a catalyst modifier as a fourth catalyst component, the presence of this catalyst modifier has adverse effects on the catalyst activity and polymer yields. Accordingly, many restrictions are required for the industrial utilization of these cobalt-based catalyst systems. It is well known that the physical properties of rubbery elastomers can be improved by blending crystalline polymers therein. For example, incorporating syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene into rubber compositions that are utilized in the supporting carcass of tires greatly improves the green strength of those compositions. Also, incorporating syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene into tire tread compositions can reduce the heat build-up and improve the wear characteristics of tires. The green strength of synthetic rubbers such as cis-1,4-polybutadiene can also be improved by incorporating a small amount of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Blends of crystalline polymers and rubbery elastomers are typically prepared by standard mixing techniques. For example, these blends can be prepared by mixing or kneading and heat-treating a crystalline polymer and a rubbery elastomer by utilizing generally known mixing equipment such as a Banbury mixer, a Brabender mixer, an extruder, a kneader, or a mill mixer. These high-temperature mixing procedures, however, have certain drawbacks including high processing costs, polymer degradation and crosslinking, inadequate mixing, as well as various process limitations. Due to the high vinyl content of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene, polymer degradation and crosslinking is a particularly severe problem for mixing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene with elastomers at high temperatures. Attempts to polymerize 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement have been hampered by the same catalyst inefficiencies and toxicities mentioned above. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,379,889 teaches polymerizing 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement by using a catalyst system comprising a cobalt compound, a dialkylaluminum halide, carbon disulfide, and an electron donative compound. And, U.S. Pat. No. 5,283,294 teaches a similar process that employs a catalyst system comprising a cobalt compound, an organoaluminum compound, and carbon disulfide. These methods, however, are inferior because the catalyst systems that are employed suffer from the foregoing disadvantages. Therefore, it would be advantageous to develop a new and significantly improved process for producing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a process for preparing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers, the process comprising the steps of (1) providing a mixture of a rubber cement and 1,3-butadiene monomer, and (2) polymerizing the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement by using a catalyst composition that is the combination of or the reaction product of ingredients comprising (a) a molybdenum-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organoaluminum compound. The present invention further provides a process for producing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers, the process comprising the steps of (1) providing a mixture of a rubber cement and 1,3-butadiene monomer, and (2) polymerizing the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement by using a catalyst composition that is formed by combining ingredients comprising (a) a molybdenum-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organoaluminum compound. The present invention also provides a blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers prepared by a process comprising the steps of (1) providing a mixture of a rubber cement and 1,3-butadiene monomer; and (2) polymerizing the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement by using a catalyst composition that is the combination of or the reaction product of ingredients comprising (a) a molybdenum-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organoaluminum compound. Advantageously, the process of this invention directly provides blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers by synthesizing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement and thereby obviates the need for high-temperature mixing. Also, good dispersion of syndiotactic 2-polybutadiene throughout rubbery elastomers can be easily and economically achieved. Significantly, the process of this invention eliminates the problems of high processing costs, polymer degradation and crosslinking, inadequate mixing, and various process limitations that are associated with high-temperature mixing procedures. The process of this invention also alleviates the problems of polymer cement thickness and reactor fouling that are associated with the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in the absence of a rubbery elastomer. In addition, the catalyst system employed in this invention has very high catalytic activity and stereoselectivity for the syndiospecific polymerization of 1,3-butadiene. This activity and selectivity, among other advantages, allows syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to be produced in very high yields within a rubber cement. Moreover, this catalyst system is very versatile and capable of producing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene with a wide range of melting temperatures without the need for a catalyst modifier that may have adverse effects on the catalyst activity and polymer yields. Additionally, this catalyst composition does not contain carbon disulfide, and therefore the toxicity, objectionable smell, dangers, and expense associated with the use of carbon disulfide are eliminated. Further, the molybdenum-containing compounds utilized in this invention are generally stable, inexpensive, relatively innocuous, and readily available. Furthermore, this catalyst composition has high catalytic activity in a wide variety of solvents including the environmentally-preferred nonhalogenated solvents such as aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS The present invention is generally directed toward a process for producing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers. It has now been found that blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers can be directly produced by polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement by using a catalyst composition comprising molybdenum. According to the process of the present invention, blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers are produced by the steps of: (1) providing a mixture of a rubber cement and 1,3-butadiene monomer, where the rubber cement includes at least one rubbery elastomer within an organic solvent, and (2) polymerizing the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement by using a catalyst composition that is formed by combining (a) a molybdenum-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organoaluminum compound. Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention is directed toward the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement, other conjugated diene monomers can be polymerized by using the catalyst composition utilized in the present invention to form conjugated diene polymers, preferably crystalline polymers, within a rubber cement. The rubber cement employed in this invention is a solution, preferably viscous, of at least one rubbery elastomer in an organic solvent. Virtually any type of rubbery elastomer can be used to prepare the rubber cement. Some specific examples of suitable rubbery elastomers include, but are not limited to, natural rubber, low-vinyl polybutadiene, cis-1,4-polybutadiene, amorphous -1,2-polybutadiene, low-vinyl polyisoprene, cis-1,4-polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, neoprene, ethylene-propylene copolymer rubber (EPR), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), styrene-isoprene rubber (SIR), styrene-isoprene-butadiene rubber (SIBR), styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SBS), styrene-butadiene block copolymer (SB), hydrogenated styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SEBS), hydrogenated styrene-butadiene block copolymer (SEB), styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer (SIS), styrene-isoprene block copolymer (SI), hydrogenated styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer (SEPS), hydrogenated styrene-isoprene block copolymer (SEP), polysulfide rubber, acrylic rubber, urethane rubber, silicone rubber, epichlorohydrin rubber, and the like. Mixtures of the above rubbery elastomers may also be used. These rubbery elastomers are well known and, for the most part, are commercially available. Also, those skilled in the art will be able to readily synthesize these rubbery elastomers by using techniques that are well known in the art. The rubber cement can be prepared by dissolving the above-mentioned rubbery elastomers in an organic solvent. When commercially available rubbery elastomers are employed to prepare the rubber cement, it may be necessary to purify the commercial products before use in order to remove residual water and additives that may become catalyst poisons in the subsequent step of polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement. In a preferred embodiment, the rubber cement is prepared in situ by polymerizing one or more appropriate monomers into rubbery elastomers in an organic solvent within the same reactor that is subsequently used for polymerizing 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. As noted above, many methods of synthesizing the above-mentioned rubbery elastomers are well known in the art. Preferably, however, the catalyst utilized in preparing the rubbery elastomers should not contain any ingredients that may interfere with the catalyst subsequently used in the step of polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement. Coordination catalyst systems, which are well known in the art, can be used for preparing the rubber cement of rubbery elastomers in situ. For example, lanthanide-based catalyst systems comprising a lanthanide compound such as a neodymium compound, an alkylating agent, and a source of halogen are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,297,667, 3,541,063, 3,794,604, which are incorporated herein by reference. These lanthanide-based catalyst systems are particularly useful for polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into cis-1,4-polybutadiene rubber. When a coordination catalyst such as the lanthanide-based system is used to synthesize rubbery elastomers, the catalyst is preferably inactivated by adding a terminator prior to proceeding with the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement. Suitable terminators include, but are not limited to, alcohols, carboxylic acids, inorganic acids, water, and mixtures thereof. It is not always necessary, however, to add a terminator to inactivate the catalyst system used to synthesize the rubbery elastomers since it is believed that the catalyst may be inactivated by the hydrogen phosphite component of the molybdenum-based catalyst composition that is subsequently used to synthesize the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. This has been found to be true in the case where a coordination catalyst that includes a neodymium compound, an alkylating agent, and a source of halogen ion is used to synthesize the rubbery elastomers. Also, anionic polymerization initiators, which are well known in the art, can be used for preparing the rubber cement of rubbery elastomers in situ. These initiators include, but are not limited to, organolithium initiators such as butyllithium or functional initiators such as lithium amide initiators, aminoalkyl lithium initiators, and organotin lithium initiators. Exemplary initiators are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,153,159, 5,268,439, 5,274,106, 5,238,893, 5,332,810, 5,329,005, 5,578,542, 5,393,721, 5,491,230, 5,521,309, 5,496,940, 5,574,109, 5,523,364, 5,527,753, and 5,550,203. These initiators are particularly useful for synthesizing conjugated diene elastomers or copolymers of conjugated diene monomers and vinyl-substituted aromatic monomers. When an anionic initiator is used to prepare the rubbery elastomers, it is preferred to quench the polymerization by adding a terminator prior to proceeding with the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement. Suitable terminators include, but are not limited to, metal halides, organic halides, alcohols, carboxylic acids, inorganic acids, sulfonic acid, water, and mixtures thereof. Metal halides, such as diethylaluminum chloride and ethylaluminum dichloride, are preferred, as are organic halides such as trimethylsilylchloride. Failure to quench the anionic polymerization may interfere with the formation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Other methods that are useful for synthesizing rubbery elastomers are known in the art, and the practice of this invention should not be limited to the selection of any particular elastomer, or to any particular method for synthesizing rubbery elastomers. Suitable monomers that can be polymerized to form the rubbery elastomers include conjugated diene monomers. Vinyl-substituted aromatic monomers can be copolymerized with one or more conjugated diene monomers to form rubbery elastomers. Some specific examples of suitable conjugated diene monomers that can be polymerized into rubbery elastomers include 1,3-butadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, 2-phenyl-1,3-butadiene, 2-ethyl-1,3-butadiene, isoprene, 1,3-pentadiene, 2-methyl-1,3-pentadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-pentadiene, 3-methyl-1,3-pentadiene, 4-methyl-1,3-pentadiene, 1,3-hexadiene, 2,4-hexadiene, and 4,5-diethyl-1,3-octadiene. Some specific examples of suitable vinyl-substituted aromatic monomers that can be polymerized into rubbery elastomers include styrene, 4-methylstyrene, a-methylstyrene, 3,5-diethylstyrene, 4-ethylstyrene, 4-propylstyrene, 3,5-diethylstyrene, 2,4,6-trimethylstyrene, 4-dodecylstyrene, 2,3,4,5-tetraethylstyrene, 3-methyl-5-normal-hexylstyrene, 4-phenylstyrene, 2-ethyl-4-benzylstyrene, 3,5-diphenylstyrene, 1-vinylnaphthalene, 3-ethyl-1-vinylnaphthalene, 6-isopropyl-1-vinylnaphthalene, 6-cyclohexyl-1-vinylnapthalene, 7-dodecyl-2-vinylnaphthalene, and the like, and mixtures thereof. In preparing the rubber cement, it is normally desirable to select an organic solvent that is inert with respect to the catalyst systems that will be employed to synthesize the rubbery elastomers and the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Suitable types of organic solvents that can be utilized in preparing the rubber cement include, but are not limited to, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, and aromatic hydrocarbons. Some representative examples of suitable aliphatic solvents include n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, n-decane, isopentane, isohexanes, isoheptanes, isooctanes, 2,2-dimethylbutane, petroleum ether, kerosene, petroleum spirits, and the like. Some representative examples of suitable cycloaliphatic solvents include cyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane, methylcyclohexane, and the like. Some representative examples of suitable aromatic solvents include benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, diethylbenzene, mesitylene, and the like. Commercial mixtures of the above hydrocarbons may also be used. For environmental reasons, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic solvents are highly preferred. The concentration of the rubbery elastomers in the rubber cement varies depending on the types of the rubbery elastomers and organic solvent employed. It is generally preferred that the concentration of the rubbery elastomers be in a range of from about 5% to about 35% by weight of the rubber cement, more preferably from about 10% to 30% by weight of the rubber cement, and even more preferably from about 15% to about 25% by weight of the rubber cement. The foregoing rubber cement is then utilized as a polymerization medium for the stereospecific polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Thus, 1,3-butadiene monomer, the molybdenum-based catalyst composition, and optionally additional organic solvent are added to the rubber cement. The order in which the 1,3-butadiene monomer, the molybdenum-based catalyst composition, and the solvent are added to the rubber cement does not limit the scope of the invention, although it may be preferable to add the molybdenum-based catalyst composition, or at least an ingredient thereof, prior to the addition of the 1,3-butadiene monomer. The amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer added to the rubber cement is contingent upon the proportion of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene desired in the resultant polymer blend. The additional organic solvent can be selected from the group of the organic solvents mentioned above for the preparation of the rubber cement, and may be the same as or different from the organic solvent used in preparing the rubber cement. It should be noted that the addition of 1,3-butadiene monomer to the rubber cement may not be required in the case where 1,3-butadiene monomer is employed to prepare the rubbery elastomers and the polymerization is stopped before all the 1,3-butadiene is consumed, thereby providing the remaining 1,3-butadiene monomer for synthesizing the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene without the need to add additional 1,3-butadiene monomer. The polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement is catalyzed by a molybdenum-containing catalyst composition. Molybdenum-containing catalyst compositions are described in co-pending patent applications U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/328,549, which are incorporated herein by reference. As noted above, the catalyst composition employed in the present invention is formed by combining (a) a molybdenum-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organoaluminum compound. In addition to the three catalyst ingredients (a), (b), and (c), other organometallic compounds or Lewis bases can also be added, if desired. Various molybdenum-containing compounds or mixtures thereof can be employed as ingredient (a) of the catalyst composition utilized in this invention. It is generally advantageous to employ molybdenum-containing compounds that are soluble in hydrocarbon solvents such as aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbon-insoluble molybdenum-containing compounds, however, can be suspended in the polymerization medium to form the catalytically active species and are therefore also useful. The molybdenum atom in the molybdenum-containing compounds can be in various oxidation states ranging from 0 up to +6. Suitable types of molybdenum-containing compounds that can be utilized include, but are not limited to, molybdenum carboxylates, molybdenum organophosphates, molybdenum organophosphonates, molybdenum organophosphinates, molybdenum carbamates, molybdenum dithiocarbamates, molybdenum xanthates, molybdenum Î²-diketonates, molybdenum alkoxides or aryloxides, molybdenum halides, molybdenum pseudo-halides, molybdenum oxyhalides, and organomolybdenum compounds.

Useful hydrogen phosphite compounds that can be employed as ingredient (b) of the molybdenum-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention are either acyclic hydrogen phosphites, cyclic hydrogen phosphites, or mixtures thereof. In general, acyclic hydrogen phosphites may be represented by the following keto-enol tautomeric structures: where R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, are mono-valent organic groups. Preferably, R1 and R2 are hydrocarbyl groups such as, but not limited to, alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, substituted cycloalkenyl, aryl, allyl, substituted aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, and alkynyl groups, with each group preferably containing from 1 carbon atom, or the appropriate minimum number of carbon atoms to form the group, up to 20 carbon atoms. These hydrocarbyl groups may contain heteroatoms such as, but not limited to, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus atoms. The acyclic hydrogen phosphites exist mainly as the keto tautomer (shown on the left), with the enol tautomer (shown on the right) being the minor species. The equilibrium constant for the above-mentioned tautomeric equilibrium is dependent upon factors such as the temperature, the types of R1 and R2 groups, the type of solvent, and the like. Both tautomers may be associated in dimeric, trimeric or oligomeric forms by hydrogen bonding. Either of the two tautomers or mixtures thereof can be employed as the ingredient (b) of the catalyst composition utilized in this invention. Some representative and non-limiting examples of suitable acyclic hydrogen phosphites are dimethyl hydrogen phosphite, diethyl hydrogen phosphite, dibutyl hydrogen phosphite, dihexyl hydrogen phosphite, dioctyl hydrogen phosphite, didecyl hydrogen phosphite, didodecyl hydrogen phosphite, dioctadecyl hydrogen phosphite, bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)hydrogen phosphite, diisopropyl hydrogen phosphite, bis(3,3-dimethyl-2-butyl)hydrogen phosphite, bis(2,4-dimethyl-3-pentyl)hydrogen phosphite, di-t-butyl hydrogen phosphite, bis(2-ethylhexyl)hydrogen phosphite, dineopentyl hydrogen phosphite, bis(cyclopropylmethyl)hydrogen phosphite, bis(cyclobutylmethyl) hydrogen phosphite, bis(cyclopentylmethyl)hydrogen phosphite, bis(cyclohexylmethyl)hydrogen phosphite, dicyclobutyl hydrogen phosphite, dicyclopentyl hydrogen phosphite, dicyclohexyl hydrogen phosphite, dimethyl hydrogen phosphite, diphenyl hydrogen phosphite, dinaphthyl hydrogen phosphite, dibenzyl hydrogen phosphite, bis(1-naphthylmethyl)hydrogen phosphite, diallyl hydrogen phosphite, dimethallyl hydrogen phosphite, dicrotyl hydrogen phosphite, ethyl butyl hydrogen phosphite, methyl hexyl hydrogen phosphite, methyl neopentyl hydrogen phosphite, methyl phenyl hydrogen phosphite, methyl cyclohexyl hydrogen phosphite, methyl benzyl hydrogen phosphite, and the like. Mixtures of the above dihydrocarbyl hydrogen phosphites may also be utilized. In general, cyclic hydrogen phosphites contain a divalent organic group that bridges between the two oxygen atoms that are singly-bonded to the phosphorus atoms. These cyclic hydrogen phosphites may be represented by the following keto-enol tautomeric structures: where R3 is a divalent organic group. Preferably, R3 is a hydrocarbylene group such as, but not limited to, alkylene, cycloalkylene, substituted alkylene, substituted cycloalkylene, alkenylene, cycloalkenylene, substituted alkenylene, substituted cycloalkenylene, arylene, and substituted arylene groups, with each group preferably containing from 1 carbon atom, or the appropriate minimum number of carbon atoms to form the group, up to 20 carbon atoms. These hydrocarbylene groups may contain heteroatoms such as, but not limited to, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus atoms. The cyclic hydrogen phosphites exist mainly as the keto tautomer (shown on the left), with the enol tautomer (shown on the right) being the minor species. The equilibrium constant for the above-mentioned tautomeric equilibrium is dependent upon factors such as the temperature, the types of R3 group, the type of solvent, and the like. Both tautomers may be associated in dimeric, trimeric or oligomeric forms by hydrogen bonding. Either of the two tautomers or mixtures thereof can be employed as the ingredient (b) of the catalyst composition utilized in this invention. The cyclic hydrogen phosphites may be synthesized by the transesterification reaction of an acyclic dihydrocarbyl hydrogen phosphite (usually dimethyl hydrogen phosphite or diethyl hydrogen phosphite) with an alkylene diol or an arylene diol. Procedures for this transesterification reaction are well known to those skilled in the art. Typically, the transesterification reaction is carried out by heating a mixture of an acyclic dihydrocarbyl hydrogen phosphite and an alkylene diol or an arylene diol. Subsequent distillation of the side-product alcohol (usually methanol or ethanol) that results from the transesterification reaction leaves the new-made cyclic hydrogen phosphite. Some specific examples of suitable cyclic alkylene hydrogen phosphites are 2-oxo-(2H)-5-butyl-5-ethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-5,5-dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-5-ethyl-5-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-5,5-diethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-5-methyl-5-propyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4-isopropyl-5,5-dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,6-dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4-propyl-S-ethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,5-dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, and the like. Mixtures of the above cyclic alkylene hydrogen phosphites may also be utilized. Some specific examples of suitable cyclic arylene hydrogen phosphites are 2-oxo-(2H)-4,5-benzo-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,5-(3\u2032-methylbenzo)-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,5-(4\u2032-methylbenzo)-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,5-(4\u2032-tert-butylbenzo)-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, 2-oxo-(2H)-4,5-naphthalo-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane, and the like. Mixtures of the above cyclic arylene hydrogen phosphites may also be utilized. The catalyst composition utilized in this invention further comprises an organoaluminum compound, which has been designated as ingredient (c). As used herein, the term \u0093organoaluminum compound\u0094 refers to any aluminum compound containing at least one aluminum-carbon bond. It is generally advantageous to employ organoaluminum compounds that are soluble in a hydrocarbon solvent. A preferred class of organoaluminum compounds that can be utilized is represented by the general formula AlRnX3âˆ’n, where each R, which may be the same or different, is a mono-valent organic group that is attached to the aluminum atom via a carbon atom, where each X, which may be the same or different, is a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a carboxylate group, an alkoxide group, or an aryloxide group, and where n is an integer of 1 to 3. Preferably, each R is a hydrocarbyl group such as, but not limited to, alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, substituted cycloalkenyl, aryl, allyl, substituted aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, and alkynyl groups, with each group preferably containing from 1 carbon atom, or the appropriate minimum number of carbon atoms to form the group, up to about 20 carbon atoms. These hydrocarbyl groups may contain heteroatoms such as, but not limited to, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus atoms. Preferably, each X is a carboxylate group, an alkoxide group, or an aryloxide group, with each group preferably containing from 1 carbon atom, or the appropriate minimum number of carbon atoms to form the group, up to about 20 carbon atoms. Thus, some suitable types of organoaluminum compounds that can be utilized include, but are not limited to, trihydrocarbylaluminum, dihydrocarbylaluminum hydride, hydrocarbylaluminum dihydride, hydrocarbylaluminum dihalide, dihydrocarbylaluminum halide, dihydrocarbylaluminum carboxylate, hydrocarbylaluminum bis(carboxylate), dihydrocarbylaluminum alkoxide, hydrocarbylaluminum dialkoxide, dihydrocarbylaluminum aryloxide, hydrocarbylaluminum diaryloxide, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Trihydrocarbylaluminum compounds are generally preferred. Some specific examples of organoaluminum compounds that can be utilized include trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, tri-n-propylaluminum, triisopropylaluminum, tri-n-butylaluminum, tri-n-hexylaluminum, tri-n-octylaluminum, tricyclohexylaluminum, triphenylaluminum, tri-p-tolyl-aluminum, tribenzylaluminum, diethylphenylaluminum, diethyl-p-tolylaluminum, diethylbenzylaluminum, ethyldiphenylaluminum, ethyldi-p-tolylaluminum, ethyl-dibenzylaluminum, diethylaluminum hydride, di-n-propylaluminum hydride, diisopropylaluminum hydride, di-n-butylaluminum hydride, diisobutylaluminum hydride, di-n-octylaluminum hydride, diphenylaluminum hydride, di-p-tolyl-aluminum hydride, dibenzylaluminum hydride, phenylethylaluminum hydride, phenyl-n-propylaluminum hydride, phenylisopropylaluminum hydride, phenyl-n-butylaluminum hydride, phenylisobutylaluminum hydride, phenyl-n-octylaluminum hydride, p-tolylethylaluminum hydride, p-tolyl-n-propylaluminum hydride, p-tolylisopropylaluminum hydride, p-tolyl-n-butylaluminum hydride, p-tolyl-isobutylaluminum hydride, p-tolyl-n-octylaluminum hydride, benzylethylaluminum hydride, benzyl-n-propylaluminum hydride, benzylisopropylaluminum hydride, benzyl-n-butylaluminum hydride, benzylisobutylaluminum hydride, and benzyl-n-octylaluminum hydride, ethylaluminum dihydride, n-propylaluminum dihydride, isopropylaluminum dihydride, n-butylaluminum dihydride, isobutylaluminum dihydride, n-octylaluminum dihydride, dimethylaluminum chloride, diethylaluminum chloride, diisobutylaluminum chloride, dimethylaluminum bromide, diethylaluminum bromide, dimethylaluminum fluoride, diethylaluminum fluoride, methylaluminum dichloride, ethylaluminnum dichloride, isobutylaluminum dichloride, methylaluminum dibromide, ethylaluminum dibromide, methylaluminum difluoride, ethylaluminum difluoride, methylaluminum sesquichloride, ethylaluminum sesquichloride, isobutylaluminum sesquichloride, dimethylaluminum hexanoate, diethylaluminum octoate, diisobutylaluminum 2-ethylhexanoate, dimethylaluminum neodecanoate, diethylaluminum stearate, diisobutylaluminum oleate, methylaluminum bis(hexanoate), ethylaluminum bis(octoate), isobutylaluminum bis(2-ethylhexanoate), methyl-aluminum bis(neodecanoate), ethylaluminum bis(stearate), isobutylaluminum bis(oleate), dimethylaluminum methoxide, diethylaluminum methoxide, diisobutylaluminum methoxide, dimethylaluminum ethoxide, diethylaluminum ethoxide, diisobutylaluminum ethoxide, dimethylaluminum phenoxide, diethylaluminum phenoxide, diisobutylaluminum phenoxide, methylaluminum dimethoxide, ethylaluminum dimethoxide, isobutylaluminum dimethoxide, methylaluminum diethoxide, ethylaluminum diethoxide, isobutylaluminum diethoxide, methylaluminum diphenoxide, ethylaluminum diphenoxide, isobutylaluminum diphenoxide, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Another class of organoaluminum compounds that can be utilized is aluminoxanes. Aluminoxanes are well known in the art and comprise oligomeric linear aluminoxanes that can be represented by the general formula: and oligomeric cyclic aluminoxanes that can be represented by the general formula: where x is an integer of 1 to about 100, preferably about 10 to about 50; y is an integer of 2 to about 100, preferably about 3 to about 20; and each R4, which may be the same or different, is a mono-valent organic group that is attached to the aluminum atom via a carbon atom. Preferably, each R4 is a hydrocarbyl group such as, but not limited to, alkyl, cycloallyl, substituted cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, substituted cycloalkenyl, aryl, allyl, substituted aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, and alkynyl groups, with each group preferably containing from 1 carbon atoms, or the appropriate minimum number of carbon atoms to form the group, up to about 20 carbon atoms. These hydrocarbyl groups may contain heteroatoms such as, but not limited to, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus atoms. It should be noted that the number of moles of the aluminoxane as used in this application refers to the number of moles of the aluminum atoms rather than the number of moles of the oligomeric aluminoxane molecules. This convention is commonly employed in the art of catalysis utilizing aluminoxanes. In general, aluminoxanes can be prepared by reacting trihydrocarbylaluminum compounds with water. This reaction can be performed according to known methods, such as (1) a method in which the trihydrocarbylaluminum compound is dissolved in an organic solvent and then contacted with water, (2) a method in which the trihydrocarbylaluminum compound is reacted with water of crystallization contained in, for example, metal salts, or water adsorbed in inorganic or organic compounds, and (3) a method in which the trihydrocarbylaluminum compound is added to the monomer or monomer solution that is to be oligomerized, and then water is added. Some specific examples of aluminoxane compounds that can be utilized include methylaluminoxane (MAO), modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), ethylaluminoxane, butylaluminoxane, isobutylaluminoxane, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Isobutylaluminoxane is particularly useful on the grounds of its availability and its solubility in aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon solvents. Modified methylaluminoxane can be formed by substituting about 20-80% of the methyl groups of methylaluminoxane with C2 to C12 hydrocarbyl groups, preferably with isobutyl groups, by using techniques known to those skilled in the art. The catalyst composition utilized in this invention has very high catalytic activity for polymerizing 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene over a wide range of total catalyst concentrations and catalyst ingredient ratios. The polymers having the most desirable properties, however, are obtained within a narrower range of total catalyst concentrations and catalyst ingredient ratios. Further, it is believed that the three catalyst ingredients (a), (b), and (c) can interact to form an active catalyst species. Accordingly, the optimum concentration for any one catalyst ingredient is dependent upon the concentrations of the other catalyst ingredients. The molar ratio of the hydrogen phosphite to the molybdenum-containing compound (P/Mo) can be varied from about 0.5:1 to about 50:1, more preferably from about 1:1 to about 25:1, and even more preferably from about 2:1 to about 10:1. Where ingredient (c) of the catalyst composition utilized in the present invention comprises an organoaluminum compound defined by the formula AlRnX3âˆ’n, the molar ratio of the organoaluminum compound to the molybdenum-containing compound (Al/Mo) can be varied from about 1:1 to about 100:1, more preferably from about 3:1 to about 50:1, and even more preferably from about 5:1 to about 25:1. When ingredient (c) of the catalyst composition utilized in the present invention comprises an aluminoxane, the molar ratio of the aluminoxane to the molybdenum-containing compound (Al/Mo) can be varied from about 5:1 to about 500:1, more preferably from about 10:1 to about 200:1, and even more preferably from about 20:1 to about 100:1. As discussed above, the molybdenum-based catalyst composition utilized in the present invention is preferably formed by combining the three catalyst ingredients (a), (b), and (c). Although an active catalyst species is believed to result from this combination, the degree of interaction or reaction between the various ingredients or components is not known with any great degree of certainty. Therefore, it should be understood that the term \u0093catalyst composition\u0094 has been employed to encompass a simple mixture of the ingredients, a complex of the various ingredients that is caused by physical or chemical forces of attraction, a chemical reaction product of the ingredients, or a combination of the foregoing. The molybdenum-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention can be formed by combining or mixing the catalyst ingredients or components by using, for example, one of the following methods: First, the catalyst composition may be formed in situ by adding the three catalyst ingredients to the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and 1,3-butadiene monomer in either a stepwise or simultaneous manner. When adding the catalyst ingredients in a stepwise manner, the sequence in which the ingredients are added is not critical. Preferably, however, the molybdenum-containing compound is added first, followed by the hydrogen phosphite, and then followed by the organoaluminum compound. Second, the three catalyst ingredients may be pre-mixed outside the polymerization system at an appropriate temperature, which is generally from about âˆ’20Â° C. to about 80Â° C., and the resulting catalyst composition is then added to the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and 1,3-butadiene monomer. Third, the catalyst composition may be pre-formed in the presence of 1,3-butadiene monomer. That is, the three catalyst ingredients are pre-mixed in the presence of a small amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer at an appropriate temperature, which is generally from about âˆ’20Â° C. to about 80 Â° C. The amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer that is used for the catalyst pre-forming can range from about 1 to about 500 moles per mole of the molybdenum-containing compound, more preferably from about 4 to about 100 moles per mole of the molybdenum-containing compound, and even more preferably from about 10 to about 50 moles per mole of the molybdenum-containing compound. The resulting catalyst composition is then added to the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and the remainder of the 1,3-butadiene monomer that is to be polymerized. Fourth, as a further variation, the catalyst composition can also be formed by using a two-stage procedure. The first stage involves combining the molybdenum-containing compound and the organoaluminum compound in the presence of a small amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer at an appropriate temperature, which is generally from about âˆ’20Â° C. to about 80Â° C. In the second stage, the foregoing reaction mixture and the hydrogen phosphite are charged in either a stepwise or simultaneous manner to the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and the remainder of the 1,3-butadiene monomer that is to be polymerized. Fifth, an alternative two-stage procedure may also be employed. A metal-ligand complex is first formed by pre-combining the molybdenum-containing compound and the hydrogen phosphite compound. Once formed, this molybdenum-ligand complex is then combined with the organoaluminum compound to form the active catalyst species. The molybdenum-ligand complex can be formed separately or in the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer methylheptyl) and the 1,3-butadiene monomer that is to be polymerized. This complexation reaction can be conducted at any convenient temperature at normal pressure, but for an increased rate of reaction, it is preferred to perform this reaction at room temperature or above. The time required for the formation of the molybdenum-ligand complex is usually within the range of about 10 minutes to about 2 hours after mixing the molybdenum-containing compound with the hydrogen phosphite compound. The temperature and time used for the formation of the molybdenum-ligand complex will depend upon several variables including the particular starting materials and the solvent employed. Once formed, the molybdenum-ligand complex can be used without isolation from the complexation reaction mixture. If desired, however, the molybdenum-ligand complex may be isolated from the complexation reaction mixture before use. Sixth, the three catalyst ingredients may be added to the rubber cement prior to or simultaneously with the addition of 1,3-butadiene monomer. When a solution of the catalyst composition or one or more of the catalyst ingredients is prepared outside the polymerization system as set forth in the foregoing methods, an organic solvent or carrier is preferably employed. Useful solvents include hydrocarbon solvents such as aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons. Non-limiting examples of aromatic hydrocarbon solvents include benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, diethylbenzene, mesitylene, and the like. Non-limiting examples of aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents include n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, n-decane, isopentane, isohexanes, isopentanes, isooctanes, 2,2-dimethylbutane, petroleum ether, kerosene, petroleum spirits, and the like. And, non-limiting examples of cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon solvents include cyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane, methylcyclohexane, and the like. Commercial mixtures of the above hydrocarbons may also be used. For environmental reasons, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic solvents are highly preferred. The foregoing organic solvents may serve to dissolve the catalyst composition or ingredients, or the solvent may simply serve as a carrier in which the catalyst composition or ingredients may be suspended. The production of blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers according to this invention is accomplished by polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer within the rubber cement by using a catalytically effective amount of the foregoing catalyst composition. To understand what is meant by a catalytically effective amount, it should be understood that the total catalyst concentration to be employed in the polymerization mass depends on the interplay of various factors such as the purity of the ingredients, the polymerization temperature, the polymerization rate and conversion desired, and many other factors. Accordingly, a specific total catalyst concentration cannot be definitively set forth except to say that catalytically effective amounts of the respective catalyst ingredients should be used. Generally, the amount of the molybdenum-containing compound used can be varied from about 0.01 to about 2 mmol per 100 g of 1,3-butadiene monomer, more preferably from about 0.02 to about 1.0 mmol per 100 g of 1,3-butadiene monomer, and even more preferably from about 0.05 to about 0.5 mmol per 100 g of 1,3-butadiene monomer. In performing the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement, a molecular weight regulator may be employed to control the molecular weight of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to be produced. As a result, the scope of the polymerization system can be expanded in such a manner that it can be used for the production of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene having a wide range of molecular weights. Suitable types of molecular weight regulators that can be utilized include, but are not limited to, Î±-olefins such as ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, and 1-octene; accumulated diolefins such as allene and 1,2-butadiene; nonconjugated diolefins such as 1,6-octadiene, 5-methyl-1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene, 3,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, 4-vinylcyclohexene, 1,4-pentadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-hexadiene, 1,6-heptadiene, 1,2-divinylcyclohexane, 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene, 5-methylene-2-norbornene, 5-vinyl-2-norbonene, dicyclopentadiene, and 1,2,4-trivinylcyclohexane; acetylenes such as acetylene, methylacetylene and vinylacetylene; and mixtures thereof. The amount of the molecular weight regulator used, expressed in parts per hundred parts by weight of the 1,3-butadiene monomer (phm), is from about 0.01 to about 10 phm, preferably from about 0.02 to about 2 phm, and more preferably from about 0.05 to about 1 phm. The molecular weight of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to be produced can also be effectively controlled by conducting the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer in the presence of hydrogen gas. In this case, the partial pressure of hydrogen gas is preferably from about 0.01 to about 50 atmospheres. The polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement may be carried out as a batch process, a continuous process, or even a semi-continuous process. In the semi-continuous process, 1,3-butadiene monomer is intermittently charged as needed to replace that monomer already polymerized. In any case, the polymerization is desirably conducted under anaerobic conditions by using an inert protective gas such as nitrogen, argon or helium, with moderate to vigorous agitation. The polymerization temperature may vary widely from a low temperature, such as âˆ’10Â° C. or below, to a high temperature such as 100Â° C. or above, with a preferred temperature range being from about 20Â° C. to about 90Â° C. The heat of polymerization may be removed by external cooling, cooling by evaporation of the 1,3-butadiene monomer or the solvent, or a combination of the two methods. Although the polymerization pressure employed may vary widely, a preferred pressure range is from about 1 atmosphere to about 10 atmospheres. Once a desired conversion is achieved, the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement can be stopped by adding a polymerization terminator that inactivates the molybdenum-based catalyst system. Typically, the terminator employed to inactivate the catalyst system is a protic compound, which includes, but is not limited to, an alcohol, a carboxylic acid, an inorganic acid, water, or a combination thereof. An antioxidant such as 2,6-di-tert-butyl4-methylphenol may be added along with, before or after the addition of the terminator. The amount of the antioxidant employed is usually in the range of 0.2% to 1% by weight of the polymer product. When the polymerization reaction has been stopped, the blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and the rubbery elastomer can be recovered from the polymerization mixture by utilizing conventional procedures of desolventization and drying. For instance, the blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and the rubbery elastomer may be isolated from the polymerization mixture by coagulation of the polymerization mixture with an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol, or by steam distillation of the solvent and the unreacted 1,3-butadiene monomer, followed by filtration. The product is then dried to remove residual amounts of solvent and water. The polymer blend produced is a highly dispersed blend of crystalline syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and the rubbery elastomer. Advantageously, the molybdenum-based catalyst composition employed in this invention can be manipulated to vary the characteristics of the syndiotactic 1,2polybutadiene in the polymer blend. Namely, the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in the polymer blend made by the process of this invention can have various melting temperatures, molecular weights, 1,2-linkage contents, and syndiotacticities, all of which are dependent upon the selection of the catalyst ingredients and the ingredient ratios. For example, it has been found that the melting temperature, molecular weight, 1,2-linkage content, and syndiotacticity of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene can be increased by using an organoaluminum compound containing sterically bulky organic groups. Non-limiting examples of these sterically bulky organic groups include isopropyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, cyclohexyl, and 2,6-dimethylphenyl groups. The use of acyclic hydrogen phosphites in lieu of cyclic hydrogen phosphites will also increase the melting temperature, molecular weight, 1,2-linkage content, and syndiotacticity of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. The blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers produced with the process of this invention have many uses. For example, these blends can be utilized in rubber compositions that are used to manufacture the supporting carcass, innerliner, and tread of tires. The blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers are also useful in the manufacture of films and packaging materials and in many molding applications. In order to demonstrate the practice of the present invention, the following examples have been prepared and tested as described in the Examples disclosed hereinbelow. The examples should not, however, be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. The claims will serve to define the invention. EXAMPLES Example 1 In this experiment, a highly dispersed blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and low-vinyl polybutadiene was prepared by polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a low-vinyl polybutadiene rubber cement. The low-vinyl polybutadiene rubber cement was prepared by charging 449 g of hexanes, 911 g of a 1,3-butadiene/hexanes blend containing 22.4% by weight of 1,3-butadiene, and 0.64 mL of 1.60 M n-butyllithium in hexanes to a two-gallon stainless-steel reactor. The polymerization was carried out at 65Â° C. for 6 hours. The catalyst was inactivated by the addition of 1.02 mL of 1.0 M diethylaluminum chloride. The conversion of the 1,3-butadiene monomer to low-vinyl polybutadiene was determined to be essentially 100% by measuring the weight of the polymer recovered from a small portion of the rubber cement. After the low-vinyl polybutadiene rubber cement produced above was cooled to room temperature, 1048 g of hexanes and 2126 g of a 1,3-butadiene/hexanes blend containing 22.4% by weight of 1,3-butadiene were added to the rubber cement. The polymerization of the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement was initiated by the addition of 13.3 mL of 0.215 M molybdenum 2-ethylhexanoate in hexanes, 43.0 mL of 0.266 M bis(2-ethylhexyl)hydrogen phosphite in hexanes, and 63.1 mL of 0.68 M of triisobutylaluminum in hexanes. The polymerization was conducted at 65Â° C. for 6 hours. The polymerization was stopped by the addition of 3 mL of isopropanol diluted with 50 mL of hexanes. The polymerization mixture was added into 10 liters of isopropanol containing 12 g of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. The resulting blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and low-vinyl polybutadiene was isolated by filtration and dried to a constant weight under vacuum at 60Â° C. The yield of the polymer blend was 632 g. The conversion of the 1,3-butadiene monomer to the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was calculated to be 90%. As determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the polymer blend had a glass transition temperature of âˆ’93Â° C. resulting from the low-vinyl polybutadiene and a melting temperature of 186Â° C. resulting from the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Example 2 In this experiment, the same procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that the polymerization of the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the low-vinyl polybutadiene rubber cement was initiated by the addition of 15.5 mL of 0.215 M molybdenum 2-ethylhexanoate in hexanes, 50.1 mL of 0.266 M bis(2-ethylhexyl)hydrogen phosphite in hexanes, and 93.1 mL of 0.68 M of tri-n-butylaluminum in hexanes. After work-up of the polymerization mixture, a highly dispersed blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and low-vinyl polybutadiene was obtained. The yield of the polymer blend was 618 g. The conversion of the 1,3-butadiene monomer to the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was calculated to be 87%. As determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the polymer blend had a glass transition temperature of âˆ’93Â° C. resulting from the low-vinyl polybutadiene and a melting temperature of 141Â° C. resulting from the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Example 3 In this experiment, a highly dispersed blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and high cis-1,4-polybutadiene was prepared by polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a high cis-1,4-polybutadiene rubber cement. The high cis-1,4-polybutadiene rubber cement was prepared by charging 449 g of hexanes, 911 g of a 1,3-butadiene/hexanes blend containing 22.4% by weight of 1,3-butadiene, 9.0 mL of 0.68 M triisobutylaluminum in hexanes, 0.41 mL of 1.0 M diethylaluminum chloride, and 0.39 mL of 0.520 M neodymium(III) neodecanoate in cyclohexane to a two-gallon stainless-steel reactor. The polymerization was carried out at 80Â° C. for 5 hours. The conversion of the 1,3-butadiene monomer to high cis-1,4-polybutadiene was determined to be 96% by measuring the weight of the polymer recovered from a small portion of the rubber cement. After the high cis-1,4-polybutadiene rubber cement produced above was cooled to room temperature, 1048 g of hexanes and 2126 g of a 1,3-butadiene/hexanes blend containing 22.4% by weight of 1,3-butadiene were added to the rubber cement. The polymerization of the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement was initiated by the addition of 13.3 mL of 0.215 M molybdenum 2-ethylhexanoate in hexanes, 43.0 mL of 0.266 M bis(2-ethylhexyl)hydrogen phosphite in hexanes, and 63.1 mL of 0.68 M of triisobutylaluminum in hexanes. The polymerization was conducted at 65Â° C. for 6 hours. The polymerization was stopped by the addition of 3 mL of isopropanol diluted with 50 mL of hexanes. The polymerization mixture was added into 10 liters of isopropanol containing 12 g of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. The resulting blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and high cis-1,4-polybutadiene was isolated by filtration and dried to a constant weight under vacuum at 60Â° C. The yield of the polymer blend was 642 g. The conversion of the 1,3-butadiene monomer to the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was calculated to be 92%. As determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the polymer blend had a glass transition temperature of âˆ’104Â° C. and a melting temperature of âˆ’8Â° C. resulting from the high cis-1,4-polybutadiene, and a melting temperature of 185Â° C. resulting from the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Example 4 In this experiment, the same procedure of Example 3 was repeated except that the polymerization of the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the high cis-1,4-polybutadiene rubber cement was initiated by the addition of 15.5 mL of 0.215 M molybdenum 2-ethylhexanoate in hexanes, 50.1 mL of 0.266 M bis(2-ethylhexyl) hydrogen phosphite in hexanes, and 93.1 mL of 0.68 M of tri-n-butylaluminum in hexanes. After work-up of the polymerization mixture, a highly dispersed blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and high cis-1,4-polybutadiene was obtained. The yield of the polymer blend was 628 g. The conversion of the 1,3-butadiene monomer to the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was calculated to be 89%. As determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the polymer blend had a glass transition temperature of âˆ’103Â° C. and a melting temperature of âˆ’7Â° C. resulting from the high cis-1,4-polybutadiene, and a melting temperature of 141Â° C. resulting from the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Comparative Example 5 In this experiment, the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was conducted in the absence of a rubber cement. In the procedure used, a two-gallon stainless-steel reactor was charged with 2408 g of hexanes, 2126 g of a 1,3-butadiene/hexanes blend containing 22.4% by weight of 1,3-butadiene, 11.1 mL of 0.215 M molybdenum 2-ethylhexanoate in hexanes, 35.9 mL of 0.266 M bis(2-ethylhexyl)hydrogen phosphite in hexanes, and 52.6 mL of 0.68 M of triisobutylaluminum in hexanes. The polymerization was conducted at 65 Â° C. for 6 hours. The polymerization was stopped by the addition of 3 mL of isopropanol diluted with 50 mL of hexanes. The polymerization mixture was removed from the reactor and added into 10 liters of isopropanol containing 12 g of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol, visual inspection of the interior of the reactor revealed that severe reactor fouling had occurred. In particular, the blades and shafts of the agitator were covered with large chunks of agglomerated polymer particles, and the reactor wall was coated with a thick polymer film. Due to reactor fouling, the reactor had to be opened to recover the remaining polymer inside the reactor. The total yield of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was 450 g (94%). As determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the polymer had a melting temperature of 189 Â° C. The experiment described in Comparative Example 5 shows that reactor fouling can be a serious problem in the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in the absence of a rubber cement. Examples 1-4 show that by utilizing the process of the present invention, the problem of reactor fouling associated with the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene can be greatly reduced. Although the present invention has been described in the above examples with reference to particular means, materials and embodiments, it would be obvious to persons skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made, which fall within the scope claimed for the invention as set out in the appended claims. The invention is therefore not limited to the particulars disclosed and extends to all equivalents within the scope of the claims."

Mason, Florham Park, N.J., assignors to Allied Chemical Corporation, New York, N.Y. No Drawing. Filed June 12, 1969, Ser. No. 832,852 Int. Cl. C08d /02, 11/04, 13/28 US. Cl. 260-943 A 2 Claims ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE 1,2-butadiene polymer having at least 80% of the butadiene content combined therein in the 1,2 form is used together with a peroxy curing agent to produce a molding composition. The polybutadiene can be in a normally granular, crystalline form or in non-crystalline form. The composition cures at good rate even when antioxidant to inhibit premature curing is included in the composition. A heat distortion temperature of at least 250 C. can be obtained. Conventional ingredients of molding compounds such as fillers and mold lubricants can be incorporated with the composition. The composition can be worked without curing up to a temperature of about 150 C. and cured at higher temperatures. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to improved curable molding compositions based upon butadiene polymers. The term molding composition or molding compound is used herein and in the appended claims in a broad sense, to include compression and transfer molding, encapsulation, coating, casting, etc. Molding compositions from butadiene polymers are broadly known, in particular such compounds based on liquid polybutadiene or liquid butadiene-styrene copolymers containing a high proportion such as about 80% by weight of butadiene ingredient. See for example V SPE Journal for March 1965, page 288. These prior art molding compounds are valuable for their high chemical resistance, thermal stability, chemical properties and electrical properties. However they suffer from a disadvantage of rather slow cure cycles at normal curing temperatures such as about 150-170 C. using conventional proportions of known peroxy curing agents. Generally in these prior art butadiene polymers about 65%7'of the butadiene content is in the 1,2 form, i.e. in the form which produces a pendant vinyl group upon the polymer backbone. Butadiene polymers of high vinyl content are known in the art; e.g. from Montecatini British Pats. 835,752, published May 25, 1960 and 854,515, published Nov. 23, 1960 the syndiotactice, the isotacatic, and the amorphous (atactic) forms of 1,2-polybutadiene having high con: tent of vinyl groups are known. British Pat. 835,752'discloses the curing of elastic 1,2-polybutadiene polymer in which 80%90% of the double bonds are vinyl, by use of a rubber curing formulation in presenceof antioxidant at 160 C. for 30 minutes. A rubbery product is obtained. SUMMARY vinyl butadiene polymer) permitsahigher rate of cure, even with an antioxidant in the composition, than obtainable with the polybutadienes of about 60%-70% 1,2- butadiene content heretofore proposed for use in molding compositions formulated with peroxy curing agent. i The 1,2-butadiene content herein stated is determined by ratios of infrared absorption peaks-see the above noted British Pat. 854,615 at page 1, lines 68-74. The term molding compositions is used herein and in the appended claims in a broad sense to include compositions usable in compression molding, transfer molding, encapsulation, coating, casting and like operations. In practising our invention we use high vinyl butadiene polymer having molecular weights (determined from intrinsic viscosities) in the range of broadly 1,0001,000, 000. This range of molecular weights provides molding compositions, formulated with peroxy curing agents, having a fusion temperature of around C. or below. Using polymers of molecular weight up to about 50,000 gives suflicient fluidity at about 120-150 C. to fill an intricate mold in transfer molding operations. We have found that molecular weight has an influence on curing rate, higher values tending to give higher rates; so that a preferred minimum molecular weight is about 10,000 (determined from intrinsic viscosity). To maintain these molecular weights without premature curing of the resin, it is desirable to include in the molding composition a polymerization inhibitor of the antioxidant type, such as a phenolic or amine antioxidant, e.g. an antioxidant based on a 6-tert.-butyl-m-cresol derivative such as 4,4-butylidene-bis(6-tert.-butyl-m-cresol); or a hindered polyphenol; or an antioxidant such as a secondary aromatic amine, e.g. N-phenyl-beta-naphthylamine. Suitably such antioxidant is added to a slurry of the polymer such as formed in the polymerization reaction to coat and thereby protect the polymer particles from the curing action of air. As above noted, our mold ing compositions containing a peroxy curing agent are fusible at say 120-150 C.; and with curing agent of adequate stability they remain practically uncured at such temperatures, at least at moderate exposure times sufficient for blending, such as about 5-20 minutes, and when containing a small amount such as 0.l%l0% by weight of antioxidant. This behavior allows not only the preparation of blends, but also allows filling a mold by injection of melt; or coating an object with a melt of the molding composition, and thereafter curing by subjecting the composition to a temperature of at least 120 C. for sufficient time to effect a cure. A high level of cure can be obtained in a few minutes at say 190 C3, the specific temperature required depends upon choice of curing agent and proportion thereof. PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The examples which follow illustrate the best mode contemplated by us for carrying out our invention; but the invention is not to be understood,as limited to the particular details of the examples. The polybutadiene employed in the examples, unless otherwise noted, had about 90%95% of the butadiene content thereof combined in the 1,2 form and had intrinsic viscosity of about 0.4 dl./gm., corresponding to molecular weight of about 20,- 000 by intrinsic viscosity determination (number average of about 10,000 by osmometry). The polybutadiene con: tained 0.3% by weight of antioxidant. It was prepared by Procedure (A) as follows: Procedure (A) A three neck flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer is purged free of air with dry nitrogen. To the flask is added 1.5 g. (0.0130 mole) of aluminum triethyl is added. After by 2 ml. of butadiene liquefied at 0 C. To the catayst is added 100 m. of benzene. The mixture is stirred and maintained at a temperature of 17 C.-20 C.; whereupon 1.5 g. (0.0130 mole) of aluminum triethyl is added. After stirring for 30 minutes the contents of the flask are transferred under a purge of nitrogen to a loading device for attachment and charging to the reactor. A second loader is charged with 2095 g. of butadiene and 2 ml. (0.0122 mole) of diethyl fumarate. Both loaders =are attached to a clean dry one gallon glass lined auto- 'clave which has been purged with nitrogen for 15 minutes. To the reactor is added 525 g. of butadiene. Stirring is started and cooling water is circulatedaround the reactor jacket untilthe temperature is 20. C.25 C. The pressure is approximately 30 p.s.i.g. The catalyst solution is added by'gravity from the other loader to the reactor. After 15 minutes, an additional 525 g. of butadiene is fed to the reactor. Addition is continued at 15 minute intervals until all the monomer has been added. The reaction is continued so that the total time is 4 hours. At the end of this period the product is discharged through the bottom of the reactor into a second vessel equipped with a vent line for unreacted monomer. This vessel contains 2 liters of isopropyl alcohol and 50 ml. of hydrochloric acid. A nitrogen purge is attached to the reactor to pass through the bottom discharge line below the surface of the liquid in the lower vessel. The purge is conducted for 15 minutes. The product is filtered from the deactivation medium and transferred to a blender (Waring) containing 1.5 liters of isopropyl alcohol and 3.4 g. of a commercial hindered polyphenol antioxidant (Irganox 1076). The resin is blended for 15 minutes and filtered. It is transferred to trays and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 C. for 6 hours. There is obtained 680 g. of a white granular product. The resin has a reduced viscosity of 0.40 as measured at 1% cone. in decahydronaphthalene at 80 C., which corresponds to a molecular weight (M) of approximately 20,000 using the formula: Intrinsic viscosity: 1.5 3 X M- (See Schildknecht Vinyl and Related Polymers (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., N.Y. 1952) pages 30-31.) The curing agents of preferred embodiments are peroxy compounds having half-life of at least one minute at 130 C. Suitably the molding compositions will contain a filler such as glass fiber, asbestos, finely divided silica, clay, alumina, calcium carbonate, talc, powdered graphite or the like; and a mold lubricant such as calcium stearate or zinc stearate. EXAMPLE 1 100 parts of 1,2-polybutadiene prepared by Procedure (A) above was blended by action of a mixing head, to apply shearing forces, with 2.5 parts of peroxy curing agent, specifically 2,5 dimethyl-2,5-bis(tertiary-butyl peroxy) hexyne-3, at a temperature of initially about 110 C. which rose to about 137 C. during about 20 minutes. This blend fused at about 128 C. Blending was continued for about another 20 minutes and the blend was then cooled. The cooled blend had a crumbly consistency which allowed ready conversion to granular form convenient for feed thereof to a conventional molding press. The blend was charged into a mold cavity having a cover plate and designed to produce a plaque about oneeighth inch thick. The press was heated to 130 C. under pressure sufiicient to hold the mold closed, forabout 10 minutes, whereby the composition was fluxed and filled the cavity with some overflow. Then the temperature was raised to 175 C. and was maintained for one hour. The mold was cooled and the resulting plaque was removed. From its original granular form, the plaque had been converted to a very hard and glassy material, showing that a very high degree of cure had been achieved under the conditions employed. EXAMPLE 2 This example illustrates the production from polybuta- 4 diene of Procedure (A) of a molded plaque at a level of cure giving a heat distortion temperature, by ASTM Test D-648, of at least 250 C. 1,2-polybutadiene prepared by Procedure (A) parts) was blended as in Example 1 with 1.75 parts of the peroxy curing agent used in Example 1 and was compression molded to a test piece measuring (in inches) 1 x /2 x A3. The temperature used (190 C.) was that at which the curing agent has a half-life of one minute. This level of cure was found to result in heat distortion temperature (ASTM Test D648) of at least 250 C. and weight gain (due to solvent take-up) of 37%, after immersion of the test piece in toluene for seven days at room temperature, followed by surface drying. By contrast a 1,2-polybutadiene resin having 65% of the butadiene content in the 1,2 form and having similar molecular weight (20,000) showed 54% weight gain in the same test. Still higher degrees of cure are readily obtainable, to the point of zero change in weight, by seven days immersion in various reagents including 10% and 50% NaOH, 50% sulfuric acid, conc. nitric acid, glacial acetic acid, pyridine, methyl ethyl ketone, and xylene. Such high cures are obtained for example by use of 4 parts of peroxy compound and C. for 30 minutes. Shore D hardness as high as 88 can be'obtained. EXAMPLE 3 The resulting composition, which could be readily gran- .ulated, was supplied in crumb \"form-to the compression molding apparatus of Example 1. The composition was cured by compression molding for 10 minutes at C. I The cured composition showed the following properties initially, and after oven heating in air, using standard tests: PROPERTIES OF THETtMOSET SAMPLE- ROOM TEMPE RATURE 1 day 20 days Initial at 200 C. at 200 C.

Two-fifths (160 parts) of the mix was withdrawn and 93.4 parts of ether-soluble, amorpheus, atactic 1,2-polybutadiene having about 85% of the butadiene content thereof combined in the 1,2 form was added to the blender with 6.6 parts of diallyl isophthalate prepolymer (Dapon M from FMC Corporation). This polybutadiene had molecular weight of about 40,000- 45,000. The kneading action of the mixer produced a thick dough in about three minutes. To this was added 2.5 parts of di-alpha-cumyl peroxide followed by the remaining 160 parts of filler and coupling agent mixture. Mixing was continued until a total of five minutes of kneading was utilized. The mixture was then blended on an unheated roll mill for approximately to 6 minutes during which time a dozen end-passes were made (procedure whereby blend is taken from the rolls as a sheet, the sheet is rolled up and it is passed in rolled up form endwise between the rolls of the mill again). At the end of this time the distance between the rolls was widened, so that the final sheeted blend was approximately A\" thick. The resulting sheet was cut into appropriate size chips for molding. The composition was compression molded into test bars at about 150 C./5 minutes/ 10,000 p.s.i. and the bars were post cured in an oven at 135 C. for 2 hours. The molded pieces had flexural strength of 11,000 p.s.i. and a flexural modulus (both on type I samples per ASTM Test D-790) of 1.54 p.s.i. The heat distortion temperature (ASTM D-648) exceeded 220 C. EXAMPLE 5 The atactic 1,2-polybutadiene of Example 4 100 parts) We claim: 1.

The polybutadiene is in the normally granular, crystalline, largely syndiotactic form. When molding compositions of this polybutadiene are formulated on a roll mill, the compositions are granulated. Those formulated with peroxy curing agents will readily cure to a heat distortion temperature of at least 250 C. even when containing an antioxidant serving to inhibit premature curing. Conventional ingredients of molding compounds such as fillers and mold lubricants can be incorporated with the compositions. The compositions including a peroxy curing agent and an antioxidant can be worked without curing at temperatures above the fusion temperature, and cured at higher temperatures. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to improved curable molding compositions based upon butadiene polymers. The term molding composition or molding compoun is used herein and in the appended claims in a broad sense, to include compression and transfer molding, encapsulation, coating, casting, etc. Molding compositions from 1,2 polybutadiene polymers and free-radical curing agents, particularly peroxy curing agents, are broadly known, in particular such compounds based on liquid 1,2-polybutadiene or liquid butadiene-styrene copolymers containing a high proportion such as about 80% by weight of butadiene ingredient, largely combined in the 1,2-form. See for example SPE Journal for March 1965, page 288. These prior art molding compounds are valuable for their high chemical resistance, thermal stability, chemical properties and electrical properties. Crystalline 1,2-polybutadiene polymers are known in the art, for example crystalline syndiotactic 1,2-butadiene with at least 90% of the butadiene present in the 1,2 form is known from Montecatini British Pat. 835,752 published May 25, 1960. Also the crystalline isotactic form of 1,2- polybutdaiene is known from Montecatini British Pat. 854,615, published Nov. 23, 1960. SUMMARY This invention provides a practical 1,2-polybutadiene curable molding composition. In accordance with this invention, normally granular, crystalline 1,2-polybutadiene polymer is formulated with a free-radical curing agent into a molding composition. The use of crystalline polybu tadiene makes formulation of molding compositions by dry blending procedures both feasible and attractive. Moreover the use of crystalline polybutadiene facilities granulation of a formulated composition as it comes in sheet form from a roll mill, making for easy handling compared to the handling of prior art gummy polybutadiene formulations prepared on a mill. The term molding compositions is used herein and in the appended claims in a broad sense to include compositions usable in compression molding, transfer molding, encapsulation, coating, casting and like operations. The term polymer is used herein in a broad sense to include not only homopolymers but also copolymers or interpolymers such as random copolymers, alternating copolymers, block copolymers and graft copolymers wherein the named constituent is the major proportion of the polymer. Crystallinity of the butadiene polymer is verified by its normally granular condition; and can be demonstrated by X-ray examination. In our invention we use butadiene polymer having molecular weights (determined from intrinsic viscosities) in the range of broadly 1,000100,000. This range of molecular weights provides molding compositions, formulated with peroxy curing agents, having a fusion temperature of around 130 C. or below. Using polymers of molecular weight up to about 50,000 gives suflicient fluidity at about 120150 C. to fill an intricate mold in transfer molding operations. To maintain these molecular weights without premature curing of the resin, it is desirable to include in the molding composition a polymerization inhibitor of the antioxidant type, such as a phenolic or amine antioxidant, e.g. an antioxidant based on a 6-t.-butyl-m-cresol derivative such as 4,4'-butylidene-bis(6-t-butyl-m-cresol); or a hindered polyphenol; or an antioxidant such as a second ary aromatic amine, e.g. N-phenylbeta-naphthylamine. Suitably such antioxidant is added to a slurry of the polymer such as formed in the polymerization reaction, to coat and thereby protect the polymer particles from the curing action of air. As above noted, our molding compositions containing a peroxy curing agent are fusible at say 120150 C.; and with curing agent of adequate stability they remain practically uncured at such temperatures, at least at moderate exposure times sufficient for blending, such as about 5-20 minutes, and when containing a small amount such as 0.l%l0% by weight of antioxidant. This behavior allows not only the preparation of blends, but also allows filling a mold by injection of melt; or coating an object with a melt of the molding composition, and thereafter curing by subjecting the composition to a temperature of at least 120 C. for suflicient time to eflect a cure. A high level of cure can be obtained in a few minutes at say 160l90 C.; the specific temperature required depends upon choice of curing agent and proportion thereof. PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The examples which follow illustrate the best mode contemplated by us for carrying out our invention; but the invention is not to be understood as limited to the particular details of the examples. In each example the polybutadiene employed was crystalline and had about %-95 of the butadiene content thereof combined in the 1,2 form. The polybutadiene contained 0.3% by weight of antioxidant. It was prepared by Procedure (A) as follows: Procedure (A) A three neck flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer is purged free of air with dry nitrogen. To the flask is added 1.5 g. (0.0042 mole) of cobaltic acetylacetonate, followed by 2 ml. of butadiene liquefied at 0 C. To the catalyst is added ml. of benzene. The mixture is stirred and maintained at a temperature of 17 C.20 C.; whereupon 1.5 g. (0.0130 mole) of aluminum triethyl is added. After stirring for 30 minutes the contents of the flask are transferred under a purge of nitrogen to a loading device for attachment and charging to the reactor. A second loader is charged with 2095 g. of butadiene and 2 ml. (0.0122 mole) of diethyl fumarate. Bofli loaders are attached to a clean dry one gallon glass lined autoclave which has been purged with nitrogen for 15 minutes. To the reactor is added 525 g. of butadiene. Stirring is started and cooling water is circulated around the reactor jacket until the temperature is C.- C. The pressure is approximately p.s.i.g. The catalyst solution is added by gravity from the other loader to the reactor. After 15 minutes, an additional 525 g. of butadiene is fed to the reactor. Addition is continued at 15 minute intervals until all the monomer has been added. The reaction is continued so that the total time is 4 hours. At the end of this period the product is discharged through the bottom of the reactor into a second vessel equipped with a vent line for unreacted monomer. This vessel contains 2 liters of isopropyl alcohol and ml. of hydrochloric acid. A nitrogen purge is attached to the reactor to pass through the bottom discharge line below the surface of the liquid in the lower vessel. The purge is conducted for 15 minutes. The product is filtered from the deactivation medium and transferred to a blender (Waring) containing 1.5 liters of isopropyl alcohol and 3.4 g. of a commercial hindered polyphenol antioxidant (Irganox 1076). The resin is blended for 15 minutes and filtered. It is transferred to trays and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 C. for 6 hours. There is obtained 680 g. of a white granular product. The resin has a reduced viscosity of 0.40 as measured at 1% cone. in decahydronaphthalene at C., which corresponds to a molecular weight (M) of approximately 20,000 using the formula: Intrinsic viscosity: 1.53 10* M (See Schildknecht Vinyl and Related Polymers (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., NY. 1952) pp. 30-31). The curing agents of preferred embodiments are peroxy compounds having half-life of at least one minute at 130 C. Suitably the molding compositions will contain a filler such as glass fiber, asbestos, finely divided silica, clay, alumina, calcium carbonate, talc, powdered graphite or the like; and a mold lubricant such as calcium stearate or zinc stearate. EXAMPLE 1 parts of 1,2-polybutadiene prepared by Procedure (A) above was blended by action of a mixing head, to apply shearing forces, with 2.5 parts of peroxy curing agent, specifically 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-bis(tertiary-butyl peroxy) hexyne-3, at a temperature of initially about C. which rose to about 137 C. during about 20 minutes. This blend fused at about 128 C. Blending was continued for about another 20 minutes and the blend was then cooled. The cooled blend had a crumbly consistency which allowed ready conversion to granular form convenient for feeding to a conventional molding press. The granular blend was charged into a mold cavity having a cover plate and designed to produce a plaque about one-eighth inch thick. The press was heated to C. under pressure sufiicient to hold the mold closed, for about 10 minutes, whereby the composition was fluxed and filled the cavity with some overflow. Then the temperature was raised to 175 C. and was maintained for one hour. The mold was cooled and the resulting plaque was removed. From its original granular form, the composition had been converted to a very hard and glassy material, showing that a very high degree of cure had been achieved under the conditions employed. EXAMPLE 2 This example illustrates the production of a molded plaque at a level of cure giving a heat distortion temperature, by ASTM Test D648, of at least 250 C. The samples, prepared for molding as in Example 1, were compression molded for 10 minutes at 190 C. The proportion of curing agent was 1.75 parts. The temperature used (190 C.) was that at which the curing agent has a half-life of one minute. This level of cure was found to result in heat distortion temperature of at least 25 0 C. and solvtdl? it ks -up of 37% by weight when the sample was immersed in toluene for seven days at room temperature. Still higher degrees of cure are readily obtainable, to the point of zero change in weight, by 7 days immersion in various reagents including 10% and 50% NaOH, 50% sulfuric acid, conc. nitric acid, glacial acetic acid, pyridine, methyl ethyl ketone, and xylene. Such high cures are obtained for example by use of 4 parts of peroxy compound a and 175 C. for 30 minutes. Shore D hardness as high as 88 can be obtained. EXAMPLE 3 This example illustrates production of a filled composition. A molding compound was formed by blending the following ingredients together with chloroform to a dough-like consistency, then air drying and milling on a roll mill for about five minutes at about C.: 1,2-polybutadicne prepared by Procedure (A)100 parts by Weight; Peroxy curing agent of Example l-5 parts; Hydrophobic electrical grade calcium carbonate powder, all particles below 8 microns diameter330 parts; Glass fibers inch)50 parts; Vinyl silane (coupling agent for glass)5 parts; Diallyl isophthalate (cure promoter)-l0 parts. The resulting composition, which could be readily granulated, was supplied in granular form to the compression molding apparatus of Example 1. The composition was cured by compression molding for 10 minutes at 190 C. The cured composition showed the following properties, initially and after oven heating in air, using standard tests: PROPERTIES OF THERMOSET SAMPLE ROOM TEMPERATURE Properties of thermoset sample at 200 C. Tensile modulus (p.s.i.) 1.2)(10 Ultimate tensile strength (p.s.i.) 950 Ultimate elongation (percent) 0.9 Flexural modulus (p.s.i.) 3.9 10 Flexural strength (p.s.i.) 2805 EXAMPLE 4 A roll mill was heated until the front roll was 250 F. and the back roll was 100 F. Then 20 parts of polybutadiene prepared by Procedure (A) above was added gradually with a narrow setting of the separation (nip) between the rolls until the resin sheeted on the hot roll. Then a mixture of 80 parts of finely divided silica filler, 0.2 part of zinc stearate and 0.2 part of vinyl silane (glass coupling agent) was added during 5 minutes. Finally 3 parts of di-alpha-cumyl peroxide was gradually added over the full extent of the nip. Milling was continued for an additional 5 minutes; then the composition was sheeted off, rolled up and passed in rolled up form endwise between the slightly separated rolls. This operation of passing the rolled up stock between the rolls was repeated 15 to 20 times. Finally the composition was sheeted from the mill, cooled and reduced in commercial equipment to a granular powder. This composition was compression molded under less severe conditions than used in Example 3 above, viz. at about C. for about 1 minute. The product had heat distortion temperature (by ASTM Test D-648 of at least 250 C. EXAMPLE 5 Ingredients parts crystalline 1,2-polybutadiene parts calcium carbonate 3 parts di-alpha-cumyl peroxide 5 parts glass fiber filler inch) 0.5 part vinyl silane coupling agent Add above ingredients to a conventional ball mill and mix for 10 minutes. The resulting dry blended composition is sufliciently homogeneous for use in molding, particularly in applications in which shear forces are applied as in injection or transfer molding. We claim: 1.

        "text": "Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a process for producing a UV ray cross-linked 1,2-polybutadiene foamed products having a uniform structure and a comparatively high cross-linking degree. 2. Description of the Prior Art Plastics are required to be durable when they are used as materials in industry, agriculture, engineering, construction, or the like. Therefore, intensive research has been carried out to increase the durability of plastics. In recent years, however, there has been an increasing demand to develop materials which exhibit controlled natural degradation after use in order to prevent environmental pollution due to plastic waste. In general, high molecular weight compounds gradually degrade when exposed to sun light for several years, and, finally, they are degraded to such a degree that they no longer maintain their original form. This is attributable to the fact that sun light comprises irradiation having the necessary wavelength and intensity to split high molecular weight chains. The quantum yield of the molecular bond split is generally as low as 10-3 to 10-5. However, one year's exposure to sun light carries enough light energy to split ordinary high molecular weight chains, and hence high polymers are degraded, after accumulated degradation for several years, to such a degree that their original form is destroyed by a slight external force. Ordinary plastics such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, etc., are not easily degraded, when pure, by sun light having wavelength distribution of 290 to 400 mÎ¼ since they do not absorb radiation of longer than 300 mÎ¼ in wavelength. Therefore, in order to raise this quantum yield, it is necessary to add a photosensitizer absorbing radiation of longer than 300 mÎ¼ in wavelength to thereby expand the sensitization wavelength region. Thus, research has been conducted on adjusting the degree of photodegradability using various photosensitizing agents. In the case of using such agents, it still takes several hours to several months to make the plastics brittle. In general, absorption of light by molecules is necessary for a photochemical reaction. For the effective absorption of light by molecules of a material to be irradiated, the irradiating light must be well transmitted through the whole material, i.e., a totally uniform and sufficient degree of cross-linking can be attained unless the UV rays are transmitted through the material uniformly and sufficiently. Taking the transmitting capability of UV rays into consideration, it is unavoidable that the cross-linking degree becomes non-uniform in the depthwise direction. The upper limit of the amount of UV irradiation is that which is necessary to cause photodegradation of the material to be irradiated. The efficiencies of transmission and absorption of UV rays and of cross-linking at this irradiation level mainly decide the maximum thickness of practically producable cross-linked materials, and, therefore, foamed products. That is, when the efficiencies of transmission and absorption of UV irradiation or of cross-linking is low, the surface layer becomes over cross-linked, while the inner \"core\" is under cross-linked, resulting in inferior foamed products. 1,2-polybutadiene transmits UV rays of longer than 240 mÎ¼ well. The percent transmission thereof is double, or more, that of polyethylene. In addition, since 1,2-polybutadiene is liable to be photocross-linked based on the vinyl groups in its side chains, it has the merit that comparatively thick uniform cross-linked materials can be obtained. However, in practice, various additives such as fillers, colorants, antioxidants, lubricants, foaming agents, etc., are usually compounded therewith, and these materials generally scatter, obstruct or absorb UV rays to prevent transmission to inner portions and reduce the efficiency of photosensitizers. Therefore, with opaque materials which contain various additives it is difficult to attain a uniform and sufficient cross-linking degree. In order to obtain cross-linked foamed products of a comparatively high expansion ratio, it is necessary to compound a foaming agent therewith in a correspondingly large amount. The foaming agent generally scatters, obstructs or absorbs UV rays and greatly reduces the efficiency of the transmission or the response of the material being irradiated thereto. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain a uniform cross-linked material having a comparatively high cross-linking degree from foamable materials containing a large amount of a foaming agent so that comparatively thick, uniformly foamed products of a high expansion ratio are obtained only with difficulty. Thus, compounding ingredients which do not prevent the transmission of UV rays and a photosensitizing action, rather which accelerate these effects would be especially valuable. Cross-linking of rubbery plastics or rubber includes chemical cross-linking using an organic peroxide or a sulfur compound and physical cross-linking using ionizing radiation; the latter conveniently being utilized for the production of cross-linked foamed products. Physical cross-linking enables to design a process for continuously producing foamed products of good quality having uniform cells with a desired expansion ratio since it does not require heat and pressure to cause cross-linking as does chemical cross-linking. On the other hand, chemical cross-linking attains cross-linking through the thermal decomposition of a cross-linking agent, and the process involves steps at various temperatures, i.e., softening point of the base resin â‰¦ kneading temperature < temperature at which thermal decomposition of the cross-linking agent is initiated â‰¦ temperature at which the thermal decomposition of a foaming agent is initiated â‰¦ cross-linking and foaming temperature. In order to obtain foamed products having a uniform, fine cellular structure, it is generally necessary to conduct cross-linking prior to foaming, and thermal cross-linking takes a comparatively long period of time. This is the main factor which inhibits the practice of a simple, highly productive cross-linking process as with physical cross-linking. However, cross-linking using ionizing radiation involves high equipment cost for related equipment to shield radiation harmful to humans as well as for the main equipment. In addition, such a process is not advantageous from the viewpoint of the steps involved. Japanese Patent Publication No. 10298/71 describes a process for cross-linking and foaming by irradiating polyethylene with ultraviolet rays of low energy. However, pure polyethylene does not absorb radiation having a wavelength of 150 mÎ¼ or longer, and has a molecular structure which is not influenced by ultraviolet rays of 290 to 400 mÎ¼ in wavelength. Actually, the poor light resistance thereof is attributable to the absorption region in the longer wavelength region due to processing impurities which contaminate the resin and carbonyl groups formed by oxidation upon thermal hysteresis. Still, polyethylene per se is essentially non-responsive to light in the ultraviolet region. Therefore, even in the process of shifting the absorption wavelength region by the addition of a photosensitizer, ultraviolet rays travel through the materials to be irradiated only a short distance, resulting in non-uniform cross-linking. Also, cross-linking processes require a comparatively long period of time, so that the production of cross-linked foamed products has not extensively been put into practice. Conventional processes for producing rubber foamed products are as follows. Rubber foamed products can generally be classified into foam rubbers and sponge rubbers. Processes for producing the former are roughly classified into: (1) a sodium silicofluoride process; (2) a thermal coagulating process; and (3) a low temperature coagulating process, according to the process for coagulating the latex, while processes for producing the latter are roughly classified into (A) foaming by mechanical stirring; (B) decomposing a foaming agent; (C) injecting pressurized gas, followed by the removal of pressure; and (D) extracting soluble materials, according to the foaming type, or (a) press curing; (b) autoclave curing; and (c) air vulcanization, according to the type of curing rubber. (A),(B) and (C) are in many cases applied to (c), (a) and (b), respectively, with the application of pressure being a great factor. In any case, a cross-linking process which is required in the production of rubber foamed products involves thermally cross-linking after mechanically compounding a cross-linking agent into the rubber, and requires a comparatively high temperature and a long time. Therefore, various compounding ingredients or modified production steps have been considered, but so far there has been no fundamental use of thermal cross-linking procedures. 1,2-polybutadiene has in every unit a hydrogen atom and a vinyl group both bonded to a tertiary carbon atom at the allyl position, and is therefore, liable to be activated by high energy source such as heat and light. For example, 1,2-polybutadiene comparatively easily undergoes cross-linking and cyclization by short wavelength irradiation (not longer than 350 mÎ¼) and undergoes hardening type degradation. Therefore, thin film 1,2-polybutadiene materials easily become brittle when exposed for several weeks to summer sunlight, and become destroyable by wind force. Due to this property, 1,2-polybutadiene belongs to the class of photodegradable plastics. It is known that, with a 50Î¼ thick 1,2-polybutadiene film (trade name: JSR RB-820; made by Japan Synthetic Rubber Co., Ltd.) the specific radiation amount necessary for the hardening degradation is 120 mwË‡hr/cm2 or less when the wavelength is 254 mÎ¼, and 250 mwË‡hr/cm2 for 312 mÎ¼ and 600 mwË‡hr/cm2 for 352 mÎ¼. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is an industrially excellent process which enables one to continuously produce wide, long rubber cross-linked foamed products of a high expansion ratio at ordinary pressure, which has so far been difficult, since it is not based on thermal cross-linking. As a result of investigating the behavior of the physical properties of photodegradable 1,2-polybutadiene during the period UV irradiation is conducted to cause molecular cross-linking and, as the degree of cross-linking increases the movement of molecular chains becomes more inhibited with the main chain being split to cause, in the end, molecular degradation, the inventors have found that the physical properties of the polymer in the cross-linking stage, initial stage of the photo chemical reaction, is suitable for the production of foamed products. Further research has led the inventors to the present invention which enables one to design a simple process for producing rubber foamed products in a shorter time than is required in conventional processes for producing rubber foamed products, by adding various photosensitizers in a suitable amount to 1,2-polybutadiene and adjusting the strength of ultraviolet irradiation applied thereto. The present invention relates to a process for producing rubber foamed products of extremely excellent softness. That is, it is concerned with a process for producing a foamed product from low crystalline 1,2-polybutadiene which is a reactive, thermoplastic resin having side chains containing a vinyl group and which is also classified into a synthetic rubber. More particularly, it pertains to a process for producing a photodegradable rubber foamed product of extremely excellent softness by continuous processing by incorporating 0.1 to 3% of a photosensitizer and a thermally decomposable foaming agent into a low crystalline 1,2-polybutadiene, irradiating with UV irradiation of 240 to 400 mÎ¼ in wavelength for a short time (10 minutes or less) to cause photocross-linking to such a degree that the gel fraction (to be described hereinafter) is 30 to 80%, and thereafter heating to 150Â° to 230Â° C., whereby cells are not destroyed by blowing pressure. The present invention is characterized in that a photodecomposable rubber foamed product with high extension ratio excellent in softness can be produced with high efficiency without complicated equipments and procedures as is different from conventional rubber foamed products. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In this specification, gel fraction means the percent by weight determined by using a small piece of an ultraviolet ray irradiated molding as a sample, placing this sample in an extraction thimble whose retention particle size is 8Î¼ with respect to liquid, refluxing boiling toluene for 7 hours using a Soxhlet extractor, drying for 48 hours under reduced pressure (not more than about 3 mmHg), and calculating the percent of the weight of the thus processed sample based on the weight of the sample before processing. In general, 1,2-polybutadiene polymers can be classified into (1) liquid types having a low molecular weight; (2) completely amorphous ones having a rubbery property; (3) highly crystalline ones having poor heat stability and no workability; and (4) low crystalline ones having a high molecular weight and good workability. Of these, type (1) requires increased molecular weight and cross-linking upon working, and continuous molding using an extruder or the like is difficult due to the liquid state thereof. Type (2) is so poor in heat fluidity that it is not suitable for processing in a general thermoplastic resin molding machine. With type (3), practical heat molding is difficult since the working temperature almost coincides with the decomposition point. Type (4) is a thermoplastic rubber having a moldability similar to that of thermoplastic resin. The properties of 1,2-polybutadiene are delicately influenced by the 1,2-bond content, molecular weight, and stereoregular properties of the side chain. In particular, it is necessary to carefully choose conditions in order to provide a polymer with properties required to be a thermoplastic resin and rubber by molecular designing. The 1,2-polybutadiene used in the present invention is a reactive resin having pendent vinyl groups as side chains, and Ï€ electrons present in the double bond of the vinyl groups are activated by a wavelength energy of 200 to 400 mÎ¼. The 1,2-polybutadiene used in the present invention is required to have good heat stability and the same molding property as conventional thermoplastic resins and light responsiveness as photodegradable resins. Therefore, those which possess a comparatively high amount of 1,2-bonds (about 70% or more), a comparatively high molecular weight (not less than 100,000), a comparatively low degree of crystallinity of about 10 to about 50% and 20% or more of a syndiotactic stereospecific structure are desirable. The 1,2-polybutadiene thermoplastic rubber is a solid having an adhesiveness insufficient to form pellets at room temperature and having, at a temperature above its softening point, a melt visiosity sufficient to form using a conventional molding apparatus. In order to make 1,2-polybutadiene a thermoplastic resin, the 1,2-polybutadiene should be a polymer which contains both a crystalline phase and rubber phase at room temperature due to the properties of the monomers used with the content of crystalline phase being lower than that of the rubber phase. For example, when the polymer consists of only the rubber phase it becomes a polymer belonging to type (2) above, and when it consists of a considerably high amount of crystalline phase, it becomes a type (3) polymer. Further, a polymer consisting only of 1,2-unit has not hitherto been obtained other than one having a relatively low molecular weight which is liquid because of difficulties encountered in polymerization. Therefore, in order to obtain a thermoplastic polymer it is necessary that the resin contain some 1,4-bonds. There is a close inter-relationship between the 1,2-unit content, the stereoregular structure content and degree of crystallinity. That is in 1,2-polybutadiene which is a thermoplastic rubber, the content of syndiotactic configurations increases with the content of the 1,2-bonds. When the 1,2-bond content is considerably high (not less than about 70 mol %) and the syndiotacticity is also relatively high (not less than about 20 mol %), the degree of crystallinity is relatively low (about 10 to about 50 mol %), thus providing a polymer having a molecular weight of not less than about 100,000 which can readily be produced as a thermoplastic rubber. This polymer is a 1,2-polybutadiene polymer employable in this invention. The 1,2-polybutadiene used in the present invention can be obtained according to methods described in Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 32425/1969, 32426/1969, 38070/1970, 30699/1971, 30700/1971, etc. For example, a solvent, butadiene and catalyst (e.g., cobalt bisacetylacetonate, triphenylphosphine, triethyl aluminum) are introduced into a glass tube in a proportion of Al/Co/p/butadiene = 430/1/2/100,000 (molar ratio) and allowed to react at 10Â° C. for about 18 hours, followed by adding an aging inhibitor and then stopping the reaction to thereby obtain the desired 1,2-polybutadiene. From X-ray diffraction analysis, the vinyl units in the fine structure of the polymer are present in an amount of about 90% or more. The 1,2-polybutadiene used in the present invention shows photoresponsiveness in the ultraviolet region based on the transition of Ï€ electrons present in the double bonds of the side chains thereof. This is increased by the addition of the photosensitizer to such a degree that the polymer can be degraded at the molecular level in a comparatively short time. However, deterioration of various physical properties due to this degradation of the molecular chains is not desirable from the viewpoint of working or use. Therefore, photoresponsiveness must be adjusted so that the physical properties suitable for working or use of the cross-linked material can be maintained until the desired time for the degradation of the molecule. In addition, this must be conducted in a short time. The photosensitizer should be one which sensitizes in the wavelength region of 240 to 400 mÎ¼ (corresponding to the wavelength region of a high pressure mercury lamp and the wavelength where UV irradiation is transmitted and which activates 1,2-polybutadiene to predominantly cause cross-linking while preventing decomposition of the polymer. For the above purpose, triplet sensitizers, transient metal compounds, radical initiators and photooxdation weakening substances may be used. Of these those which have toxicity or an offensive odor or which are colored cannot be used in this invention. In addition, the photosensitizer should have good miscibility with the polymer since uniform cross-linking is important in this invention. In this respect those photosensitizers having a relatively good oleophilicity can be employed with good results. For example, aromatic ketones such as benzophenone, p,p'-dimethoxybenzophenone, p,p'-dichlorobenzophenone, p,p'-demethylbenzophenone, acetophenone, acetonaphthone, benzoin methyl ether, benzoin ethyl ether, benzoin isopropyl ether, benzoin butyl ether, methyl-O-benzoyl benzoate, benzil, etc., provide good results. In addition, there can be illustrated aromatic aldehydes such as terephthalaldehyde, etc., quinone aromatic compounds such as methylanthraquinone, fluorenone, etc., and the like. These photosensitizers are used in a concentration of about 0.1 to about 3.0%, preferably 0.3 to 1.0%. If they are used in a lesser concentration, physical properties suitable for the production of foamed products are difficult to obtain, while if they are used in a greater concentration it is difficult to control the degree of cross-linking to a uniform level between the surface layer and the inner layer, resulting in a deterioration of the surface layer and the formation of a non-foamable, thick surface layer. 1,2-polybutadiene having a three-dimensional structure suitable for foaming can be obtained within 10 minutes by irradiating the polymer material containing the photosensitizer in such an amount with 365 mÎ¼ light of about a 10 to about a 150 w/m2 ultraviolet ray intensity for at least about 15 seconds. The minimum irradiation time varies depending upon the content of the photosensitizer, the composition involved and thickness of the article to be irradiated. However, it can generally be said that an irradiation time below about 15 seconds cannot lead to a uniform photochemical reaction of the article subjected to irradiation. The thickness of the materials processed in accordance with this invention is usually from about 1 to about 5 mm. When OBSH is used as a foaming agent, materials 15 mm or more in thickness can be processed in accordance with this invention. Since UV rays emitted from a UV lamp have a certain wavelength distribution, the total amount of energy of the UV rays having such a wavelength distribution irradiated on a spot varies depending upon the wavelength distribution and the distance of the spot from the light source (UV lamp). The intensity of the UV rays irradiated on a certain spot of the article to be irradiated is not a function of light energy emitted from a certain point of the light source. Generally, the intensity of the UV rays is indicated by an intensity distribution curve where UV rays having a certain wavelength can be represented as an irradiation plane. Thus, in the present invention sufficient results are obtained by conducting irradiation such that the article to be irradiated receives such an amount of energy as provided by 365 mÎ¼ light of about 10 to about 150 w/m2 for about 15 seconds to about 10 minutes. The gel fraction in boiling toluene of the thus irradiated material is 30 to 80% in 7 hours, and about 10 to about 75% in 15 hours. The irradiation time also varies depending upon the wavelength distribution of the light source; however, it is not desirable to irradiate for above about 10 minutes since side reactions occur due to the nature of 1,2-polybutadiene containing a photosensitizer. The temperature and pressure of UV irradiation are limited in no substantial way and usually irradiation is performed at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure. Of course, care must be taken so as not to elevate the temperature of the resin above its softening point since manipulation becomes difficult and side reactions such as oxidation of the polymer occurs at such temperature. If materials containing the cross-linking agent in lesser concentrations than above are irradiated with stronger light or if materials containing the cross-linking agent in a greater concentration are irradiated with weaker light, it is difficult to uniformly cross-link the materials. In particular, it is necessary to adjust the viscosity in a manner specific to the ultraviolet ray cross-linking of the present invention, since in the present invention as a photosensitizer responds to ultraviolet rays the photoresponsiveness of the 1,2-polybutadiene is raised, chemical cross-linking is predominantly conducted and splitting of the main chain proceeds less frequently. This is delicately influenced by a foaming agent, antioxidant, and other compounding ingredients. Experiments have shown that a foaming agent is desirably added in an amount of about 0 to about 20 parts, and the antioxidant in an amount of about 0.05 to about 1 part. As the other compounding ingredients, there can be illustrated a filler and the like. Generally speaking, those which do not absorb UV rays are selected and there is no specific limitation on the amounts of other compounding ingredients to be added. Foaming temperatures are 150Â° to 230Â° C. at which temperature the cells are not destroyed by the blowing pressure. The UV cross-linked 1,2-polybutadiene of the present invention undergoes a reduction in viscosity with an increase in temperature as thermoplastic resins. Therefore, if the temperature is less than 150Â° C., the viscosity necessary for foaming cannot be obtained, while if it is higher than 230Â° C., gas leakage due to a reduction in viscosity becomes serious and oxidation proceeds, whereby good products with a high expansion ratio are difficult to obtain. Although not to be construed as limitative, foaming is usually carried out at atmospheric pressure. It is preferred that foaming be performed at superatmospheric pressure when minute bubbles are desired. The foaming time in which the foaming agents decompose and expansion is completed varies depending upon the kind and amount of the foaming agent, and is not particularly limited. Foaming agents include, for example, azodicarbonamide, dinitrosopentamethylenetetramine, p-toluenesulfonylhydrazide, p,p'-oxybis(benzenesulfonylhydrazide), etc., which may be used, if necessary or desired, in combination. Foaming aids and foaming nuclei may also be added, if desired. The amount of the foaming agent used varies depending upon aimed expansion ratio. Additives such as a photosensitizer, a foaming agent and, if necessary or desired, an aging inhibitor, a softening agent, a colorant, etc., can be added to 1,2-polybutadiene within the above described conditions, and fed to a kneader and formed into a sheet or other form at a temperature higher than the resin softening point but lower than the decomposition point of the foaming agent used (generally, about 150Â° C.), then irradiated with ultraviolet rays for a short time (about 15 seconds to about 10 minutes) to convert to a resin into a three dimensional structure, followed by heating to a temperature higher than the decomposition point of the foaming agent to foam and expand the resin. Thus, there can be continuously obtained photodegradable foamed products of excellent softness. While not to be construed as limitative, usually employed expansion ratios are from about 1 to about 25 times. The process of the present invention enables one to produce a cross-linked material capable of foaming to a depth of about 7 mm within 10 minutes using a high pressure mercury lamp emitting radiation of a wavelength of 240 to 400 mÎ¼. Thus, a highly productive continuous process can be designed and can be put into practice. As explained in detail above UV ray cross-linked foamed products of 1,2-polybutadiene can be obtained in accordance with the present invention by irradiating a material prepared by kneading a base resin with suitable amounts of a photosensitizer and a thermodecomposable foaming agent with UV rays to form a suitably cross-linked material, and then heating to a temperature higher than the decomposition point of the foaming agent. This cross-linking suitably adjusts and controls the photodegradable property of 1,2-polybutadiene from the viewpoint of mechanism and velocity, and hence the kind and amount of the photosensitizer, intensity and irradiation time of UV must be delicately adjusted. Too much photosensitizer makes control difficult, resulting in over cross-linking, while insufficient photosensitizer fails to cause complete cross-linking at an economically advantageous velocity. Compositions containing 1,2-polybutadiene and a photosensitizer alone enable one to easily adjust the cross-linking degree, and obtain a comparatively high cross-linking degree. However, when a large amount of compounding ingredients are incorporated therein, the average cross-linking degree becomes low, and, taking this into consideration, a photosensitizer is usually added in excess as compared with the necessary amount. However, this is not favorable, since remaining photosensitizer causes post cross-linking, and hardening proceeds further to cause a degradation in product quality. As earlier indicated, in practice various additives are utilized which generally scatter, obstruct or absorb UV rays to prevent full transmission to inter portion of the article being irradiated. Further, in the case that one desires to form cross-linked foamed products of a comparatively high expansion ratio, foaming agent must be added thereto in a relatively large amount, which typically also exhibits such a UV scattering, etc., effect. In a highly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the inventors have discovered that p,p'-oxybis(benzenesulfonylhydrazide) (hereinafter often abbreviated as OBSH) is utilized, as this material does not prevent the transmission of UV rays, rather, accelerates the photosensitizing effect achieved. OBSH is a powdery foaming agent having a decomposition point of about 165Â° C. When this is used in a foaming composition, the efficiency of the photosensitizer is scarcely reduced and, in addition, uniform UV ray cross-linked material having a comparatively high cross-linking degree can be obtained since OBSH per se participates in the cross-linking. OBSH does not have a melting point and is slightly soluble in ordinary solvents. Therefore, it may appear to form a heterogeneous system with 1,2-polybutadiene. It was, therefore, a surprising fact that OBSH transmits UV rays well and provides a uniform and relatively high cross-linking degree, and that OBSH per se participates in the cross-linking. This may be attributed to that OBSH is a strong absorbent of UV rays and has a sensitizing action, and that OBSH per se acts as a UV ray cross-linkable foaming agent on 1,2-polybutadiene. The advantage of OBSH being a foamable cross-linking agent is that it does not possess, after its decomposition as a foaming agent, a sensitizing action, that is, OBSH not having participated in the cross-linking is decomposed and consumed as a foaming agent. The contribution of OBSH to the cross-linking becomes greater in proportion to the concentration thereof, and the effective compounding ratio is 0.5 part or more, desirably 1.0 part or more, based on 1,2-polybutadiene. If desired, in appropriate cases OBSH can be used in combination with other foaming agents such as azodicarbonamide, dinitrosopentamethylenetetramine, toluenesulfonylhydrazide, etc. The other compounding ingredients earlier enumerated are, of course, compatible therewith. Examples of the present invention are set forth below. Unless otherwise indicated all parts and percentages used herein are by weights. EXAMPLE 1 Pellets prepared by mixing 100 parts of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene having a density of 0.901 g/cm3, a 1,2-unit content of 90%, a syndiotactic structure content of 51%, a viscosity measured at 25Â° C. in toluene of 1.38 dl/g, a vicat softening point of 39Â° C., a melting point of 75Â° C., and a glass transition point of -30Â° C. (trade name: JSR, RB-810; made by Japan Synthetic Rubber Co., Ltd.) with 10 parts of azodicarbonamide and 0.7 part of benzophenone were fed to an extruder and a sheet 30 cm in width and 0.3 cm in thickness continuously extruded at a velocity of 1 m/min. This sheet was then irradiated with ultraviolet rays for 3 minutes using 1 kw high pressure mercury lamps (H4000L/3; made by Tokyo Shibaura Electric Co., Ltd.) 30 cm from both sides. The foaming agent was then decomposed by heating to 215Â° C. to obtain a rubber foamed product of a 0.06 specific gravity having a uniform, fine cellular structure which was much softer than a polyethylene cross-linked foamed product of the same expansion ratio, and which showed no bending impression upon bending ascribable to the stretching property of the base resin. When this foamed material was exposed to outdoor sunlight, destruction of its original shape was quite easy within 1 month, whereas no change was observed when it was left for 6 months in a room. The production rate in this case was about 810 g/min., and, in terms of volume, about 13.5 l/min, good productivity from the process thus being demonstrated. The gel fraction of this foamed product was about 35%. EXAMPLE 2 100 parts of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene having a density of 0.906 g/cm3, a 1,2-unit content of 92%, a syndiotactic structure content of 66%, a viscosity measured at 25Â° C. in toluene of 1.24, a vicat softening point of 52Â° C., a melting point of 80Â° C. and a glass transition point of -25Â° C. (trade name: JSR, RB-820: made by Japan Synthetic Rubber Co., Ltd.), 75 parts of an azodicarbonamide foaming agent (trade name: Spangcell DW#25: made by Eiwa Chemicals Co., Ltd.) having a decomposition point of 170Â° to 180Â° C., 0.5 part of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol, an ageing inhibitor, and 2.5 parts of benzophenone was kneaded at about 90Â° to about 100Â° C. for 10 minutes using two heated rolls to obtain a crude sheet, which was pelletized to obtain a master batch. This master batch was diluted with pellets of SJR, RB 820 to a dilution ratio of 1:5 and the resulting mixture was extruded using a uniaxial extruder of 90 mmÏ† under the conditions of a compression ratio of 3.1, a speed of 8 to 15 rpm and a temperature of 50Â° to 110Â° C. to prepare various 1 mm thick sheets. These sheets were then irradiated for 1 to 15 minutes with UV rays at a distance of 30 cm using 1 kw high pressure mercury lamp (from both sides), then the cross-linked sheet was foamed at a temperature of 170Â° to 230Â° C. As a result, sheets irradiated for 2 to 10 minutes showed a viscosity suitable for foaming. When irradiation time was shorter than 2 minutes, there resulted an insufficient viscosity which failed to foam an expanded material, while when longer than 10 minutes was used, oxidation of the surface layer proceeded so much that the surface skin layer became colored. The temperature suitable for foaming was found to be 180Â° to 230Â° C. Lower temperatures led to insufficient expansion, while higher temperatures caused serious leakage of gas, resulting in a reduction in the expansion ratio and serious coloration due to oxidation. The gel fraction of sheets irradiated for 2 to 10 minutes was about 30 to 60%, and the expansion ratio (maximum) was 18 times. EXAMPLE 3 Irradiation was conducted for 1 to 20 minutes in the same manner as in Example 2 except for changing the amount of benzophenone to 0.1 to 3.0%. As a result, a viscosity suitable for foaming was obtained by irradiating for 10 minutes or less. Comparatively good foamed products were obtained at a concentration of about 0.3 to 1.0% benzophenone. The gel fraction was about 80% (maximum). EXAMPLE 4 Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene the same as was used in Example 1 was mixed with 10 parts of p,p'-oxybis(benzenesulfonyl)hydrazide and 1.0 part of terephthalaldehyde and the resulting mixture was kneaded using two heated rolls at about 80Â° to 90Â° C. to prepare about a 5 mm thick crude sheet having a poor surface appearance, the sheet was then placed in a die 5 mm thick and then pressed at about 90Â° to about 100Â° C. at a pressure of about 50 kg/cm2 for about 5 to about 10 minutes to prepare a 5 mm thick sheet having a good surface appearance. The thus obtained sheet was withdrawn from the die after it was cooled, and then cross-linked in the same manner as in Example 1 and foamed at 165Â° C. to obtain a foamed product of a 0.15 specific gravity. EXAMPLES 5 TO 11 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1 AND 2 100 parts of 1,2-polybutadiene rubber was kneaded with predetermined amounts of a photosensitizer and a foaming agent as given in Table 1 using heated rolls at about 80Â° to about 90Â° C. for about 10 minutes to prepare about a 1 mm thick crude sheet having a poor surface appearance. The sheet was placed in a die of 1 mm thickness and then pressed at about 90Â° to about 100Â° C. and at a pressure of about 50 kg/cm2 for about 5 to about 10 minutes to prepare a 1 mm thick sheet having a good surface appearance. The thus obtained sheet was withdrawn from the die after it was cooled. The resulting sheet was then irradiated with UV rays for 5 minutes from both sides at a distance of 30 cm using 1 kw high pressure mercury lamp (H4000L/3; made by Tokyo Shibaura Electric Co., Ltd.). In general, gel fraction increases with increased cross-linking degrees because of solvent insolubility. Therefore, the gel fraction of irradiated sheets was measured by refluxing in boiling toluene for 15 hours using a Soxhlet extractor to compare the degree of cross-linking. The results are tabulated in Table 1. TABLE 1__________________________________________________________________________Comparison of Cross-Linking Degreein Terms of Gel Fraction Photosensitizer Gel (parts Foaming Agent Frac-Example by weight) (parts by weight) tionNo. Benzophenone OBSH ADCA* (%) Notes__________________________________________________________________________5 0.5 0 0 56.0 transparent sheet containing the sensitizer and no foaming agent6 0 5.0 0 4.5 OBSH alone7 0 10.0 0 9.88 0.5 10.0 0 65.5 OBSH-sensitizer9 0 2.5 7.5 7.5 mixture of OBSH and ADCA alone10 0.5 2.5 7.5 19.8 OBSH-ADCA- sensitizer11 0.5 0 10.0 10.5 ADCA-sensitizerComparative 0 0 10.0 0 ADCA aloneExample 1Comparative 0 0 0 0 blank testExample 2__________________________________________________________________________ *ADCA stands for azodicarbonamide The results in Table 1 show that an opaque sheet containing OBSH as shown in Example 8 provided a higher gel fraction than that of transparent sheet as set forth in Example 5 containing a photosensitizer alone and not containing a foaming agent. Judging from this fact and the values of Example 7, it is seen that OBSH scarcely inhibits the cross-linking effect of the photosensitizer. Examples 6 and 7 show that OBSH per se functions as a foamable UV ray cross-linking agent. Also, another foaming agent, ADCA, provided a gel fraction of only about 10% as in Example 11 where a sensitizer was used. Thus, ADCA reduces the cross-linking efficiency. Examples 9 and 10 show that OBSH has the effect of improving the degree of cross-linking and Example 8 shows that a comparatively high degree of cross-linking can be obtained. Comparative Examples 1 and 2 correspond to blank tests. When irradiated sheets as in Examples 8 and 10 are foamed at a temperature higher than the decomposition point of the foaming agent, there can be obtained very soft foamed products having extremely uniform cells. Thus, it can be seen that OBSH is an excellent UV ray cross-linkable foaming agent for 1,2-polybutadiene, capable of providing a uniform and comparatively high degree of cross-linking. EXAMPLE 12 The same composition as was used in Example 8 was kneaded using two heated rolls in the same manner as in Example 4 to prepare sheets about 4 mm in thickness. Three of the thus obtained sheets were placed in a die of 12 mm thickness one on the other followed by pressing using a heated press at about 90Â° to about 100Â° C. and at a pressure of about 50 kg/cm2 to form a 12 mm thick sheet. The resulting sheet was then irradiated with UV rays for about 7 minutes from both sides in the same as in Example 5 followed by heating at a temperature of 190Â° C. for 10 minutes to obtain a 25 mm thick, white, elastic foamed product of a 0.08 g/cm3 specific gravity which was of good quality and had uniform bubbles throughout the thickness of the sheet. EXAMPLE 13 100 parts of 1,2-polybutadiene (trade name: JSR, RB 810; made by Japan Synthetic Rubber Co., Ltd.), 0.5 parts of benzophenone, and 17 parts of a foaming agent consisting of ADCA and OBSH (ADCA:OBSH = 1:1 in part by weight) were kneaded in the same manner as in Example 1 to prepare a 1 mm thick sheet. The resulting sheet was irradiated with UV rays in the same manner as in Example 5 followed by foaming at 205Â° C. to obtain a uniformly foamed product of a 0.044 bulk specific gravity having minute bubbles. The gel fraction of this foamed product was about 40%. A foamed product having a high expansion ratio such as those obtained in this example can be obtained with a considerably high gel fraction and in this regard the content of OBSH in the foaming agent used should be about 25%. The products of this invention are useful as shock absorbers, packing materials, wrapping materials, heat insulating materials, etc. In particular, the foamed products of the present invention are most suited for backing materials such as for carpets, mats and the like, since they have excellent flexibility, elasticity and buffering properties. While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof."

        "text": "Description This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 760,211, filed Jan. 17, 1977, now abandoned. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel photosensitive compositions. More particularly, it is concerned with photosensitive compositions which are photopolymerizable by the action of actinic light and which are useful in the preparation of relief image, especially relief printing plates for flexographic printing having superior resistance to solvent type flexographic ink and mechanical properties. Many prior art references teach various photosensitive compositions useful in the preparation of relief printing plates. The flexographic printing plates obtained from unsaturated polyester type photosensitive compositions disclosed in, for example, Japanese Pat. No. 542,045 are insuffficient in resistance to solvent type flexographic ink containing organic solvents including lower alkyl alcohols such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol; esters such as ethyl acetate and n-butyl acetate; and ketones such as acetone and methylethyl ketone. Japanese Patent Laid Open 37521/1972 describes photosensitive compositions containing a specific block copolymer as a binder and the relief printing plates obtained therefrom having good resistance to alcohol based solvent type flexographic ink. However, these compositions which are solid would be economically disadvantageous in order to provide a variety of the photosensitive elements in accordance with their use conditions such as the thickness of flexographic printing plates selected, usually from about 0.4 mm. to 10 mm. and the printing machine employed. The flexographic printing plates obtained from the photosensitive compositions containing a polyester-polyether block polymer described in British Pat. No. 1,425,274 have improved mechanical properties and printing durability but their ink resistance to solvent type flexographic ink is still not enough. THE INVENTION According to this invention there is provided a photosensitive composition comprising: (I) 100 parts by weight of one prepolymer having terminal ethylenically unsaturated groups and a number average molecular weight of about 2,000 to 30,000 whose main segment is (i) a residue of a hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadiene having about 1.2 to 2.0 terminal hydroxy groups as average per molecule and a hydrogenation ratio of pendent vinyl groups of the 1,2-addition units of about 50 to 100 percent, (ii) a residue of a chain extended hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadiene having 2 to 20 urethane bonds obtained by reaction between the hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadiene and a diisocyanate, (iii) a residue of a hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadiene having terminal carboxyl groups obtained by reaction between the hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadiene and a dicarboxylic acid or (iv) a residue of a chain extended hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadiene having terminal carboxyl groups obtained by reaction between a chain extended hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadiene having terminal hydroxy groups and 2 to 20 urethane bonds having been prepared by reaction between the hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadiene and the diisocyanate, and a dicarboxylic acid, (II) about 5 to 100 parts by weight of at least one polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomeric compound, (III) a photopolymerization initiator in an amount of about 0.001 to 10 weight percent of the total weight of the prepolymer (I) and the polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomeric compound (II), and (IV) a stabilizer in an amount of about 0.001 to 2.0 weight percent of the total weight of the prepolymer (I) and the polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomeric compound (II). The photosensitive compositions according to this invention are liquid and have a suitable viscosity from the viewpoint of processability. The hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadienes which may be employed in the preparation of the prepolymers in this invention mean 1,2-polybutadienes in which at least about 50 percent of pendent vinyl groups of the 1,2-addition units are hydrogenated and poly-1-butenes. The hydrogenation ratio greatly affects the mechanical properties of photopolymerized articles. When the hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadiene having a hydrogenation ratio of less than 50 percent is employed the rubber elasticity of flexographic printing plates obtained therefrom is reduced and the hardness becomes higher, and accordingly good printing quality cannot be produced. Also the hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadienes according to this invention have at least about 1.2 and preferably 1.5 to 2.0 terminal hydroxy groups as average per molecule. When the average number of terminal hydroxy group per molecule is below 1.2, there cannot be obtained flexographic printing plates having sufficient mechanical strength. On the other hand, when the average number of terminal hydroxy groups per molecule increases to 2, the elongation and especially the mechanical strength are more improved. The hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadienes according to this invention may contain 0 to about 20 percent of 1,4-addition units. These hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadienes having at least about 1.2 terminal hydroxy groups may be either commercially available ones or those produced by conventional methods. For example, one method comprises subjecting butadiene to anion polymerization, adding ethylene oxide to the terminals of the resulting polybutadiene to give terminal hydroxy groups and subsequently hydrogenating the pendent vinyl groups of the 1,2-addition units. Another method comprises polymerizing butadiene using a metal salt such as NaPdCl4, KPdCl4, NH4 PdCl4 or PdBr2 as a polymerization initiator, introducing hydroxy groups to the terminals of the resulting polybutadiene and hydrogenating the vinyl groups of the 1,2-addition units. Still other method comprises subjecting 1-butene to radical polymerization using a peroxide or azo compound having a hydroxy group such as tert-butyl-Î²-hydroxyethyl peroxide or 4,4'-azo-bis-4-cyano-n-amyl alcohol to produce poly-1-butenes having terminal hydroxy groups. The prepolymers having terminal polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated groups which may be employed in this invention include the following five types of prepolymers: The prepolymers (I) may be prepared by effecting reaction between the hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadienes having terminal hydroxy groups and (a) a carboxylic acid or dicarboxylic acid having 3 to 5 carbon atoms and one ethylenically unsaturated group, its anhydride, its chloride or the dicarboxylic acid monoester of a lower alkyl alcohol having 1 to 3 carbon atoms. Exemplary carboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acids, anhydrides, chlorides and monoesters (a) include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acrylic anhydride, methacrylic anhydride, acrylic chloride, methacrylic chloride, itaconic anhydride, monomethyl, monoethyl, mono-n-propyl or monoisopropyl ester of itaconic acid, monomethyl, monoethyl, mono-n-propyl or monoisopropyl ester of maleic or fumaric acid. For this reaction any conventional method may be employed. For example, the reaction is carried out in the presence or absence of an esterification catalyst such as p-toluenesulfonic acid or sulfuric acid, and a thermal polymerization inhibitor such as hydroquinone at a temperature of about 60Â° C. to 180Â° C. in a nitrogen atmosphere. The prepolymers (II) of this invention may be prepared by effecting reaction between a chain extended hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadiene whose terminals are hydroxy groups and (a) the carboxylic acid having 3 to 5 carbon atoms and one ethylenically unsaturated group as employed in the preparation of the prepolymers (I) by any conventional method as in the preparation of the prepolymer (I). The prepolymers (III) of this invention may be prepared by effecting reaction between a chain extended hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadiene whose terminals are isocyanates and (b) an alcohol having one to three ethylenically unsaturated groups by conventional methods. For example, the reaction is carried out at a temperature of about 50Â° C. to 120Â° C. in the presence or absence of a catalyst such as dibutyltin dilaurate and preferably a thermal polymerization inhibitor such as hydroquinone under a dry air atmosphere. Exemplary alcohols (b) include: (i) a compound selected from the group consisting of ##STR1## wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom or methyl group, R2 represents oxycyclohexylene group, --CH2 C(CH3)2 CH2 O-- group, --CH2 C(CH2 Br)2 CH2 O-- group, an oxyalkylene group of the formula ##STR2## wherein R3 represents a hydrogen atom, methyl, monochloromethyl or monobromomethyl group; p represents an integer of 1 to 20 or --(CH2)q O-- group wherein q represents an integer of 5 to 20, (ii) trimethylolpropane di-acrylate or -methacrylate, trimethylolethane di-acrylate or -methacrylate, glycerine di-acrylate or -methacrylate and pentaerythritol tri-acrylate or -methacrylate, and (iii) allyl alcohol, 2-bromoallyl alcohol, 2-chloroallyl alcohol, glycerol diallyether, trimethylolpropane diallylether and allyl vinyl carbinol. Examples of suitable compounds (i) include 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate or methacrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl acrylate or methacrylate, 3-bromo-2-hydroxypropyl acrylate or methacrylate, 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl acrylate or methacrylate, 4-hydroxy-n-butyl acrylate or methacrylate, neopentyl glycol monoacrylate or monomethacrylate, dibromoneopentyl glycol monoacrylate or monomethacrylate, 1,6-hexanediol monoacrylate or monomethacrylate, 1,8-octanediol monoacrylate or monomethacrylate, 1,9-nonanediol monoacrylate or monomethacrylate, 1,10-decanediol monoacrylate or monomethacrylate, 1,12-dodecanediol monoacrylate or monomethacrylate, 1,18-octadecanediol monoacrylate or monomethacrylate, diethylene glycol monoacrylate or monomethacrylate, dipropylene glycol monoacrylate or monomethacrylate, dibutylene glycol monoacrylate or methacrylate, tetraethylene glycol monoacrylate or methacrylate, monoacrylates or methacrylates of polyoxyethylene diols having a number average molecular weight of about 200 to 900 monoacrylates or monomethacrylates of polyoxypropylene diols having a number average molecular weight of about 200 to 1,200 and monoacrylates or monomethacrylates of polyoxybutylene diols having a number average molecular weight of about 200 to 1,500, and ##STR3## The prepolymers (IV) may be prepared by effecting reaction between a hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadiene having terminal carboxyl groups obtained by reaction between (i) the hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadiene having terminal hydroxy groups and (ii) a dicarboxylic acid, and (c) a compound having one ethylenically unsaturated group and one oxirane ring.

For these two reactions any conventional method may be employed. For example, the esterification may be carried out in the same manner as in the preparation of the prepolymers (I). The reaction with the compound may be carried out at a temperature of about 60Â° C. to 180Â° C. in the presence of an epoxy ring opening catalyst such as trimethylbenzy ammonium hydroxide and a thermal polymerization inhibitor such as hydroquinone under a dry air atmosphere. The prepolymers (V) may be prepared by effecting reaction between a chain extended hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadiene having terminal carboxyl groups obtained by reaction between (i) the chain extended hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadiene having terminal hydroxy groups and (ii) the dicarboxylic acid as employed in the preparation of the prepolymers (IV), and (c) the compound having one ethylenically unsaturated group and one oxirane ring as employed in the preparation of the prepolymers (IV) by any conventional method as in the preparation of the prepolymer (IV). The chain extended hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadienes which are employed in the preparation of the prepolymers (II), (III) and (V) are prepared by reacting the hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadienes with a diisocyanate at a temperature of, generally about 40Â° C. to 120Â° C., and preferably about 50Â° C. to 100Â° C. in an inert gas atmosphere such as nitrogen gas in the presence or absence of a catalysts in a mole ratio of OH/NCO <1 or OH/NCO >1. The catalyst include, for example, tertiary amines such as N,N-dimethylbenzyl amine, N,N-dimethyllaurylamine and triethylene diamine (diazabicyclooctane), and organo-heavy-metal compounds soluble in the reaction system such as ferrous acetoacetate, dibutyltin dilaurate, dibutyltin di-2-hexoate, stannous oleate and stannous octoate. When the chain extending reaction is effected in a mole ratio of OH/NCO <1, the terminals of the chain extended hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadienes are isocyanate groups. On the other hand when the chain extending reaction is effected in a mole ratio of OH/NCO >1, the terminals of the chain extended hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadienes are hydroxy groups. Exemplary diisocyanates which may be employed in the preparation of the chain-extended hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadienes include 2,4-tolylene diisocyanate, 2,6-tolylene diisocyanate, hydrogenated 2,4-tolylene diisocyanate, hydrogenated 2,6-tolylene diisocyanate, m-phenylene diisocyanate, p-phenylene diisocyanate, 1,3-dimethylphenyl-2,4-diisocyanate,1,3-dimethylphenyl-4,6-diisocyanate, 1,4-dimethyl phenyl-2,5-diisocyanate, 1-chlorophenyl-2,4-diisocyanate, 4,4'-diphenyl diisocyanate, 3,3'-dimethyl-4,4'-diphenyl diisocyanate, 2,4'-diphenyl diisocyanate, 3,3'-dimethoxy-4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, 3,3'-dimethyl-4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, 1,4-naphthylene diisocyanate, 1,5-naphthylene diisocyanate, 2,6-naphthylene diisocynate, 2,7-naphthylene diisocyanate, p-xylylene diisocyanate, m-xylylene diisocyanate, 1,4-tetramethylene diisocyanate, 1,5-pentamethylene diisocyanate, 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate, 1,7-heptamethylene diiscyanate, 1,8-octamethylene diisocyanate, 1,9-nonamethylene diisocyanate, 1,10-decamethylene diisocyanate, 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,5-pentamethylene diisocyanate, 2,2'-dimethyl-1,5-pentamethylene diisocyanate, 3-methoxy-1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate, 3-butoxy-1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate, Ï‰,Ï‰'-dipropylether diisocyanate, 1,4-cyclohexyl diisocyanate, 1,3-cyclohexyl diisocyanate and mixtures of these diisocyanates. The number average molecular weight of the prepolymer and the total number of urethane bonds which are present in the chain extended hydrogenated 1,2-butadiene affect the properties of photopolymerized articles. According to this invention the number average molecular weight of the prepolymer is in the range of from about 2,000 to 30,000, and preferably 2,500 to 25,000. When the number average molecular weight is below 2,000, especially the rubber elasticity among mechanical properties of the photopolymerized articles is poor for flexographic printing plates. On the other hand, when the number average molecular weight is above 30,000 the rubber elasticity is superior but the viscosity of the photosensitive composition containing such a prepolymer remarkably increases, and as a result the workability such as processability and developability of photosensitive compositions diminishes extremely. As the total number of the urethane bonds increases the rubber elasticity of the photopolymerized articles becomes improved but the solvent resistance tends to diminish. Thus, the total number of the urethane bonds according to this invention is in the range of from 2 to 20 in order to produce flexographic printing plates having good balance between rubber elasticity and solvent resistance. Thus, the number average molecular weight of the hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadienes which may be employed in this invention is in the range of about 1,800 to 29,800, and when chain extended hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadienes are prepared the range of the number average molecular weights of the hydrogenated 1,2-polybutadienes is from about 500 to 5,000 and preferably from about 1,000 to 4,000.

Of these compounds a compound of the formula ##STR11## wherein t is an integer of 8 to 20 is especially effective for improving the solvent resistance of photopolymerized articles. The amount and kind of the polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomeric compounds are suitably selected depending upon the properties of photopolymerized articles in accordance with their use and the processability of the photosensitive compositions containing such monomeric compounds. Typically the amount is in the range of about 5 to 100 parts by weight, and preferably 20 to 70 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the prepolymer. It is necessary that the reaction of photosensitive compositions is initiated only by the action of actinic light and that they are thermally stable. Therefore, preferably polymerization initiators are thermally inactive below 40Â° C. and initiate photopolymerization upon irradiation with actinic light. Exemplary photopolymerization initiators include benzoins such as benzoin, benzoin methyl ether, benzoin ethyl ether, benzoin n-propyl ether, benzoin isopropyl ether, benzoin n-butyl ether, benzoin isobutyl ether, benzoin sec-butyl ether, benzoin n-amyl ether, benzoin isoamyl ether, alpha-methylbenzoin, alpha-ethylbenzoin, alpha-methyl benzoin methyl ether, alpha-phenylbenzoin, alpha-alkylbenzoin; anthraquinones such as anthraquinone, chloroanthraquinone, methylanthraquinone, ethyl-anthraquinone, tertiary butyl-anthraquinone; diketones such as benzil, diacetyl; phenones such as acetophenone, benzophenone, omega-bromoacetophenone; 2-naphthalene sulfonyl chloride; disulfides such as diphenyl disulfide, tetraethylthiouram disulfide; dyes such as Eosine G (C.I. 45380) and Thionine (C.I. 52025); and the like. These photopolymerization initiators are typically used in an amount of from about 0.001 to 10 weight percent, and preferably about 0.01 to 5 weight percent of the total weight of the prepolymer and the polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomeric compound. Knows stabilizers are employed for the purpose of maintaining storage stability (shelf life) of the photosensitive compositions. Such stabilizers may be added when the components of a photosensitive composition are admixed or may be added to each component separately prior to admixing of the components. Exemplary stabilizers include hydroquinone, monotert-butyl hydroquinone, 2, 5-di-tert-butyl hydroquinone, catechol, tert-butyl catechol, 2, 6-di-tert-butyl cresol, benzoquinone, 2, 5-diphenyl-p-benzoquinone, p-methoxy phenol, picric acid and di-p-fluorophenylamine. These stabilizers are added only for preventing thermal polymerization without the actinic radiation set forth above without restraining the photopolymerization reaction. Consequently the amount of the stabilizers may be about 0.001 to 2.0 percent by weight, and preferably about 0.005 to 1.0 percent by weight of the total weight of the prepolymer and the polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomeric compound. Furthermore, various compounds may be incorporated into the photosensitive compositions in order to adjust the viscosity of photosensitive composition, the mechanical properties and the solvent resistance after photopolymerization in an amount of about 0.01 to 100 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the photosensitive composition. These compounds include, for example, dioctylphthalate, butylphthayl butylene glycolate, polyester type plasticizers, epoxy type plasticizers, various phosphates and polyethers such as polypropylene glycol, process oil, liquid paraffin, liquid rubber such as butyl rubber, butadiene rubber, SBR and NBR, depolymerized natural rubber, unsaturated polyester, alkyd resin and unsaturated polyurethane. The photosensitive compositions of this invention are photopolymerized by actinic radiation having wave lengths of 2,000 to 8,000 Angstroms. Practical sources of such actinic radiation include carbon arc lamps, super high pressure mercury lamps, high pressure mercury lamps, low pressure mercury lamps, xenon lamps, ultra violet fluorescent lamps and sunlight. When the photosensitive compositions of this invention are exposed to actinic light through a process transparency, e.g., a negative or positive film, the areas corresponding to the transparent image portions are photopolymerized in about 10 seconds to 60 minutes and the non-image areas, i.e. unexposed areas, remain substantially unphotopolymerized. These non-exposed areas may be washed away with a solvent liquid such as water, an aqueous solution, an aqueous surfactant solution or an organic solvent. Exemplary solvent liquids include aqueous solutions of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, acetic acid; aqueous solutions of methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and acetone; methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, methylethyl ketone, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, phenol, ether, n-hexane, benzene, toluene, gasoline, kerosene, light oil, 1,1,1-trichloroethane trichloroethylene tetrachloroethylene or mixtures thereof; an aqueous solution of surfactants such as anionic, cationic, amphoteric or nonionic surfactants. For example, a relief printing plate may be prepared by placing a process transparency, e.g., a negative film, on a glass sheet transparent to actinic light, covering the negative film with a film transparent to actinic light such as polyester film, depositing the photosensitive composition upon the film to form a layer of about 0.4 mm to 10 mm. in thickness, placing a base or support material such as polyester film on the layer according to the process and apparatus described in German DOS Pat. No. 2,029,238, putting a glass sheet transparent to actinic light on the support material, exposing the resulting assembly to actinic light, first from the support material side, second from the negative film side or simultaneously from the support material side and the negative film side or from the negative film side in case of metal support materials or opaque support materials, removing the glass sheets, the negative film and the film covering the negative film from the assembly, washing out the unexposed portions of the layer, drying the resulting relief printing plate and, if necessary, postexposing the whole relief printing plate. Examples of suitable base or support materials include metals such as steel and aluminum plates, sheets and foils and plastics such as polyester, polyamide, polyvinylchloride, polyvinylidenechloride, polymethylmethacrylate, polystyrene and cellulose ester films and plates. These support materials may be either transparent or opaque to actinic light. The thickness of these support materials is preferably in the range of 0.1 mm. to 2.0 mm. for metal plates, sheets and foils and preferably in the range of 50 microns to 2 mm. for plastic films and plates. In the above described method of producing relief printing plates the use of a base or support material may be omitted. In such a case the resulting reliefe printing plate may be used by backing with an elastomeric substance such as rubber as well as the above described base or support material. The flexographic printing plates which are obtained from the photosensitive compositions according to this invention have superior ink resistance, especially to solvent type ink of flexographic printing as well as good ink transferability and printing reproducibility. When a film printing or a paperbacks printing is run using solvent type flexographic ink the printing durability is more than 500,000 prints. Furthermore, the printing plates which have superior water resistance do not suffer any change in their properties by environmental humidity. The photosensitive compositions of this invention have a wide range of use as elastomeric substances obtainable by the action of actinic light such as paints, coating material, adhesives, films, sheets, impregnants, photoresists for printing circuit bases and other shaped articles other than reliefe image. The present invention may be understood more readily from the following non-limiting examples.

        "text": "Description Background of the Invention [0001] Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene (SPBD) is a thermoplastic polymer which can be utilized in a wide variety of applications. For example, the incorporation of SPBD into rubber compositions which are utilized in the supporting carcass or innerliner of tires greatly improves the green strength of those compositions. Electron beam precure (microwave precure) is a technique which has gained wide commercial acceptance as a means of improving the green strength of synthetic elastomers which are used in building tires. However, electron beam precure techniques are costly. The incorporation of SPBD into blends of such synthetic elastomers can often improve green strength to the degree that electron beam precure is not required. The incorporation of SPBD into halogenated butyl rubbers which are utilized as the innerliner compositions for tires also greatly improves the scorch safety of such compositions. U.S. Patent 4,274,462 disclosed that pneumatic tires having improved resistance against heat build-up can be prepared by utilizing SPBD fibers in their tread base rubber. SPBD can also be molded into a wide variety of useful articles. [0002] Techniques for preparing SPBD by solution polymerization and by suspension polymerization are known in the art. [0003] A process is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,778,424 for the preparation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene which comprises polymerizing 1,3-butadiene in an organic solvent in the presence of a catalyst composition composed of: (a) a cobalt compound, (b) an organoaluminum compound of the formula AlR\u2083, in which R is a hydrocarbon radical of 1-6 carbons, and (c) carbon disulfide. [0004] U.S. Patent 3,901,868 reveals a process for producing a butadiene polymer consisting essentially of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene by the successive steps of: (a) preparing a catalyst component solution by dissolving, in an inert organic solvent containing 1,3-butadiene, a cobalt compound, soluble in the organic solvent, such as (i) cobalt-Î²-diketone complex, (ii) cobalt-Î²-keto acid ester complex, (iii) cobalt salt of organic carboxylic acid, and (iv) halogenated cobalt-ligand compound complex, and an organoaluminum compound, (b) preparing a catalyst composition by mixing the catalyst component solution with an alcohol, ketone or aldehyde compound and carbon disulfide, (c) providing a polymerization mixture containing desired amounts of 1,3-butadiene, the catalyst composition and an inert organic solvent, and (d) polymerizing 1,3-butadiene at a temperature of -20Â°C to 90Â°C. [0005] U.S. Patent 4,429,085 discloses a process for producing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene by suspension polymerization in an aqueous medium. In this aqueous polymerization process polybutadiene which has an essentially syndiotactic 1,2-microstructure is made by the steps of: (A) preparing a catalyst component solution by dissolving, in an inert organic solvent containing 1,3-butadiene (a) at least one cobalt compound selected from the group consisting of (i) Î²-diketone complexes of cobalt, (ii) Î²-keto acid ester complexes of cobalt, (iii) cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids having 6 to 15 carbon atoms, and (iv) complexes of halogenated cobalt compounds of the formula CoXn, wherein X represents a halogen atom and n represents 2 or 3, with an organic compound selected from the group consisting of tertiary amine alcohols, tertiary phosphines, ketones, and N,N-dialkylamides, and (b) at least one organoaluminum compound of the formula AlR\u2083, wherein R represents a hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms; (B) preparing a reaction mixture by mixing said catalyst component solution with a 1,3-butadiene/water mixture containing desired amounts of said 1,3-butadiene; (C) preparing a polymerization mixture by mixing carbon disulfide throughout said reaction mixture, and (D) polymerizing said 1,3-butadiene in said polymerization mixture into polybutadiene while agitating said polymerization mixture. [0006] U.S. Patent 4,751,275 discloses a process for the preparation of SPBD by the solution polymerization of 1,3-butadiene in a hydrocarbon polymerization medium, such as benzene, toluene, cyclohexane, or n-hexane. The catalyst system used in this solution polymerization contains a chromium-III compound which is soluble in hydrocarbons, a trialkylaluminum compound, and a dialkylphosphite, such as di-neopentylphosphite or di-butylphosphite. [0007] Heretofore, blends of SPBD with rubbery elastomers have been prepared utilizing standard mixing techniques. For instance, SPBD can be mixed throughout a rubbery elastomer utilizing a Banbury mixer or a mill mixer. However, these standard mixing procedures have certain drawbacks. These drawbacks include high processing costs, polymer degradation, inadequate mixing, and process limitations. The processing equipment required in order to mix SPBD throughout rubbery elastomers by mastication is also expensive and very costly to operate. Such standard mixing procedures result in polymer degradation due to the high shearing forces and high temperatures which may be required for mixing. For instance, it is generally desirable to mix the SPBD throughout the rubbery elastomer at a temperature which is above the melting point of the SPBD. Accordingly, SPBD powder, which is utilized in tire innerliner or carcass compounds, is mixed into the compound utilizing standard mixing procedures at a temperature which is at least as high as the melting point of the SPBD being used. Since high mixing temperatures result in degradation of the rubbery elastomer being utilized as the innerliner or carcass compound, the melting point of the SPBD utilized has typically been limited to no more than about 190Â°C. In order to limit polymer degradation, the SPBD utilized in such applications typically has a melting point of no more than about 160Â°C. Even though the green strength of tire carcass compounds containing SPBD increases with the melting temperature of the SPBD, the higher mixing temperature associated with the higher melting SPBD makes its utilization very difficult because of the degradation that occurs utilizing standard mixing techniques. Furthermore, good dispersions of SPBD throughout rubbers are difficult to attain utilizing conventional mixing techniques. Summary of the Invention [0008] This invention relates to a process for producing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene latex. It more specifically discloses a process for producing a syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene latex which comprises polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer in an aqueous medium in the presence of (1) at least one emulsifier: (2) a catalyst emulsion composition which is comprised of (a) at least one cobalt compound selected from the group consisting of (i) Î²-ketone complexes of cobalt, (ii) Î²-keto acid ester complexes of cobalt, (iii) cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids having 6 to 15 carbon atoms, and (iv) complexes of halogenated cobalt compounds of the formula CoXn, wherein X represents a halogen atom and n represents 2 or 3, with an organic compound selected from the group consisting of tertiary amine alcohols, tertiary phosphines, ketones and N,N-dialkylamides, and (b) at least one organoaluminum compound of the formula AlR\u2083 wherein R represents a hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, wherein said catalyst composition is microencapsulated in a polyene product and wherein said catalyst emulsion composition is microfluidized in an oil to a particle size which is within the range of about 10 nanometers to about 1000 nanometers: and (3) at least one member selected from the group consisting of carbon disulfide and phenyl isothiocyanate. [0009] The subject invention also reveals a process for preparing a syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene latex by emulsion polymerization which comprises polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer in an aqueous reaction mixture which is comprised of (1) water, (2) at least one emulsifier, (3) 1,3-butadiene monomer, (4) a catalyst emulsion composition which is prepared by dissolving in an inert organic solvent containing at least one polyene (a) at least one cobalt compound selected from the group consisting of (i) Î²-ketone complexes of cobalt, (ii) Î²-keto acid ester complexes of cobalt, (iii) cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids having 6 to 15 carbon atoms, and (iv) complexes of halogenated cobalt compounds of the formula CoXn wherein X represents a halogen atom and n represents 2 or 3, with an organic compound selected from the group consisting of tertiary amine alcohols, tertiary phosphines, ketones and N,N-dialkylamides, and (b) at least one organoaluminum compound of the formula AlR\u2083 wherein R represents a hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms to produce a catalyst component solution, and microfluidizing the catalyst component solution with an oil, a surfactant, and water to an average particle size which is within the range of about 10 nanometers to about 1000 nanometers; and (5) at least one member selected from the group consisting of carbon disulfide and phenyl isothiocyanate. [0010] The subject invention further discloses a catalyst emulsion composition which is useful in the emulsion polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene, which is prepared by dissolving in an inert organic solvent containing at least one polyene (a) at least one cobalt compound selected from the group consisting of (i) Î²-ketone complexes of cobalt, (ii) Î²-keto acid ester complexes of cobalt, (iii) cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids having 6 to 15 carbon atoms, and (iv) complexes of halogenated cobalt compounds of the formula CoXn, wherein X represents a halogen atom and n represents 2 or 3, with an organic compound selected from the group consisting of tertiary amine alcohols, tertiary phosphines, ketones and N,N-dialkylamides, and (b) at least one organoaluminum compound of the formula AlR\u2083 wherein R represents a hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms to produce a catalyst component solution, and microfluidizing the catalyst component solution with an oil, a surfactant, and water to an average particle size which is within the range of about 10 nanometers to about 1000 nanometers. [0011] The latices made by the process of this invention can be utilized in preparing blends of SPBD with rubbery elastomers. This can be done by simply mixing the SPBD latex with the latex of a rubber. For instance, an SPBD/styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) blend can be prepared by simply mixing the SPBD latex with an SBR latex. The SPBD/SBR blend can then be recovered utilizing conventional coagulation techniques. By utilizing this technique, all of the drawbacks associated with conventional blending of dry SPBD with dry rubbers are overcome. [0012] Blends of SPBD with various rubbery elastomers can also be prepared by utilizing the SPBD latex as the polymerization medium for preparing other emulsion rubbers. For instance, a blend of SPBD with SBR can be prepared by adding styrene monomer, 1,3-butadiene monomer, emulsifiers, and an appropriate initiator to a SPBD latex. The SBR is accordingly prepared by emulsion polymerization in the SPBD latex. This results in the formation of a latex which contains both SPBD and SBR. The SPBD/SBR blend can be recovered by simply coagulating the latex. [0013] The SPBD latices made in accordance with this invention are also valuable for utilization in other applications. For instance, SPBD powders having a very small particle size can be prepared by simply drying the SPBD latex. SPBD made utilizing other polymerization techniques must be ground in order to obtain small particle size powders. The SPBD latices of this invention can also be applied to substrates and allowed to dry. This provides the substrate with a thin coating of the SPBD. For instance, rubber slabs can be dipped in SPBD latex to prevent them from sticking together. Detailed Description of the Invention [0014] A catalyst emulsion composition is utilized to catalyze the emulsion polymerizations of this invention. A catalyst component solution is utilized in preparing such catalyst emulsion compositions. The catalyst component solution is prepared by dissolving at least one cobalt compound and at least one organoaluminum compound in an inert organic solvent containing at least one polyene monomer which is dissolved therein. [0015] The term \"an inert organic solvent\" used herein refers to an organic solvent chemically inert to all of the catalyst components, the emulsifier, the 1,3-butadiene and the SPBD. Some representative examples of inert organic solvents include aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, alicyclic hydrocarbons, halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, and mixtures of two or more of the above-mentioned compounds. Some representative examples of aromatic hydrocarbons that can be utilized include benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, diethylbenzene or isobutylbenzene. The aliphatic hydrocarbons which can be used include n-hexane, isohexanes, n-heptane, n-octane, isooctanes, n-decane, 2,2-dimethylbutane, petroleum ether, kerosene, petroleum spirit or petroleum naphtha. The alicyclic hydrocarbons that can be used include cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane. Some representative examples of halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons that can be used include chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzenes or trichlorobenzenes. [0016] The cobalt compound usable for the process of the present invention is soluble in an inert organic solvent selected from the group consisting of (i) Î²-diketone compounds; (ii) Î²-keto acid ester complexes of cobalt; (iii) cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids having 1 to 25 carbon atoms, and (iv) complexes of halogenated cobalt compounds of the formula CoXn wherein X represents a halogen atom and n represents 2 or 3, with an organic compound selected from the group consisting of tertiary amines, alcohols, tertiary phosphines, ketones and N,N-dialkylamides. [0017] The Î²-diketone compound which can be used to form a complex with a cobalt atom is of the formula: wherein RÅ¡ and R\u2074 which are the same as or different from one another, are an alkyl radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms and RË› and RÅ‚, which are the same as or different from one another, are a hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. This type of Î²-diketone complex of cobalt may be cobalt (II) acetylacetonate or cobalt (III) acetylacetonate. [0018] The Î²-keto acid ester which can be used to form a complex with a cobalt atom may be of the formula: wherein RÅ¡, RË›, RÅ‚ and R\u2074 are the same as defined above. This type of cobalt complex may be a cobalt-acetoacetic acid ethyl ester complex. [0019] Some representative examples of cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids that can be used include cobalt octoate and cobalt naphthanate. [0020] In the ligand compounds capable of forming a complex with a halogenated cobalt compound, the tertiary amine may be pyridine, triethylamine, tributylamine or dimethylaniline, the alcohol may be ethyl alcohol methyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, or n-butyl alcohol, the tertiary phosphine may be trimethyl phosphine, tributyl phosphine or triphenyl phosphine, the ketone may be acetone or methyl ethyl ketone and the N,N-dialkylamide may be N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-diethylformamide or N,N-diethylacetamide. The complex of halogenated cobalt is preferably either a complex of cobalt chloride with pyridine or ethyl alcohol. [0021] The organoaluminum compound usable for the process of the present invention is of the formula AlR\u2083 wherein R represents a hydrocarbon radical containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The hydrocarbon radical may be an alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl radical containing from about 1 to about 6 carbon atoms. Preferably, the organoaluminum compound will be trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum triisobutylaluminum or triphenylaluminum. [0022] In the preparation of the catalyst component solution, it is important that the cobalt compound and the organoaluminum compound are dissolved in the inert organic solvent containing at least one polyene. Some polyenes that can be used in the formation of the polyene products used to prepare microencapsulated catalysts are 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, isoprene, myrcene and 1,5-cyclooctadiene. Polyenes in which at least two of the double bonds are conjugated and which have minimal substitution on the double bonds are preferred, particularly 1,3-butadiene. Other olefins which can be used are those which are capable of serving as chelating agents for transition metals, such as 1,5-cyclooctadiene. Polyenes with neither conjugation nor good chelating potential are much less effective. If the preparation is carried out in the absence of a polyene, the resultant catalyst component solution is not effective as a component of the catalyst composition of the present invention. The polyene is preferably used in a ratio by mole of at least 1.0, more preferably, at least 5.0 to the amount by mole of the cobalt compound to be used in the catalyst component solution. The preferred polyenes for use in this invention are 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, isoprene, and myrcene. The most preferred polyene is 1,3-butadiene. [0023] Generally, the larger the ratio of the amount of polyene to the cobalt compound in the catalyst component solution, the higher the activity of the catalyst. However, the activity of the catalyst reaches a maximum value at a ratio by mole of polyene monomer to the cobalt compound used in the catalyst component solution of between 10 and 200. For example, if a molar ratio of polyene monomer to the cobalt compound of 10,000 is employed, the activity of the catalyst will be similar to that of the catalyst prepared from a catalyst component solution containing a ratio of polyene monomer to the cobalt compound of from 10 to 200. If the ratio is less than 1.0, the resultant catalyst composition has poor activity. [0024] The catalyst component solution is preferably prepared at a temperature of -10Â°C to 50Â°C and preferably contains 0.0005 to 1.0% by mole, more preferably 0.001 to 0.5% by mole, of the cobalt compound. The temperature at which the catalyst component solution is prepared will more preferably be within the range of 5Â°C to 25Â°C and it is also highly desirable to use vigorous agitation in the preparation of the catalyst component solution. Generally, from about 0.001 to 10 mole percent, more preferably from about 0.03 to about 5 mole percent of the organoaluminum compounds is utilized, based on the amount of 1,3-butadiene to be polymerized. The ratio by mole of the organoaluminum compound to the cobalt compound is preferably in a range from 0.2 to 50, more preferably, within the range of from 0.5 to 10. [0025] In the preparation of the catalyst component solution, it is preferred for the cobalt compound to be first dissolved in the inert organic solvent in the presence of the polyene monomer and then for the organoaluminum compound to be added to the solution. However, very satisfactory results can also be obtained when the organoaluminum compound is added first. [0026] In the preparation of this catalyst component solution, the organoaluminum compound should not be allowed to come in contact with water. This is because water can completely decompose such organoaluminum compounds. Accordingly, it is preferable that the inert organic solvent to be used to prepare the catalyst component solution be preliminarily dehydrated at least up to a content of water which is insufficient to completely decompose the entire amount of the organoaluminum compound. [0027] It is preferable that the catalyst component solution be prepared using a dry (essentially water free) inert organic solvent. However, a trace of water in the inert organic solvent can be present up to a concentration of about 500 ppm (parts per million by weight). In fact, it is believed that the total elimination of water from such a catalyst component solution is undesirable. It is preferred for no more than 200 ppm of water to be present in the inert organic solvent used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution. If the content of water in the inert organic solvent is larger than 500 ppm, the catalyst component solution has to contain a relatively large amount of the cobalt compound and organoaluminum compound. This results in an economic disadvantage. If a sufficient amount of water is present in the inert organic solvent used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution, the catalyst can be completely destroyed. The catalyst component solution will preferably be stored under an inert gas atmosphere, such as nitrogen, in the absence of sunlight or ultraviolet light. [0028] It is desirable to allow the prereaction used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution to run for a period of at least 30 seconds, and more preferably for at least 1 minute before mixing the catalyst component solution with the oil, surfactant, and water used in making the catalyst emulsion composition. Longer time periods can be used without the catalyst component solution losing its activity. [0029] After the organoaluminum compound has been incorporated in the catalyst component solution using the above-described technique, the catalyst is \"protected\" from decomposition by water. This is believed to be due to a microencapsulation of the catalyst by polyene product formed in the prereaction process used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution. [0030] It is believed that a hydrophobic shield is formed around the catalyst that water cannot readily penetrate; however, this hydrophobic shield or membrane is probably permeable by the butadiene monomer being polymerized into the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. When 1,3-butadiene is used as the polyene, the butadiene product which microencapsulates the catalyst is believed to be a butadiene monomer complex, an oligomerized butadiene or a polymer of butadiene. It has been determined that this protection is sufficient to allow for the use of this catalyst component solution in the aqueous emulsion polymerization of butadiene into SPBD. [0031] The catalyst emulsion composition is prepared by microfluidizing or microemulsifying the catalyst component solution with an oil, a surfactant and water. In preparing the catalyst emulsion composition, it is highly desirable to first mix the catalyst component solution with the oil and to separately mix the surfactant with the water. The catalyst component solution/oil mixture is then subsequently mixed with the surfactant/water mixture immediately prior to the microfluidization. The ratio of oil to catalyst component solution will normally be within the range of about 0.5 to 30. It is normally preferred for the ratio of oil to catalyst component solution to be within the range of about 1 to about 10 and it is typically most preferred for the oil to catalyst component solution ratio to be within the range of about 2 to about 3. For example, a weight ratio of oil to catalyst component solution of about 2.5:1 is highly preferred. [0032] The weight ratio of water to catalyst component solution utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition is typically within the range of about 5 to about 80. It is normally preferred for the weight ratio of water to catalyst component solution to be within the range of about 10 to about 50. In most cases it will be more preferred for the weight ratio of water to catalyst component solution utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition to be within the range of about 20 to about 30. For instance, a weight ratio of water to catalyst component solution of about 27:1 is highly preferred for utilization in preparing the catalyst emulsion compositions of this invention. The weight ratio of surfactant to catalyst component solution utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition will typically be within the range of about 0.001 to about 10. In most cases it will be preferred to utilize a weight ratio of surfactant to catalyst component solution which is within the range of about 0.05 to 5. It is typically more preferred to utilize a ratio of surfactant to catalyst component solution which is within the range of about 0.1 to 0.3. Accordingly, a weight ratio of surfactant to catalyst component solution of about 0.2:1 is highly preferred. [0033] The oil utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition will typically be a long chain paraffinic oil. Such oils will generally be mixtures of various long chain hydrocarbons which contain from about 12 to about 28 carbon atoms. It is generally preferred for these compounds to be saturated. The oil will preferably be comprised of hydrocarbon compounds which contain from about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms. It is possible to utilize long chain alcohols which contain from about 12 to about 28 carbon atoms as the oil. The utilization of such alcohols results in the SPBD being synthesized having a lower melting point. It is, accordingly, desirable to use such alcohols as the oil if SPBD having a low melting point is desired. On the other hand, if SPBD having a high melting point is sought, then it will not be desirable to utilize alcohols as the oil. It is, of course, also possible to utilize a combination of paraffinic oils and alcohols to adjust the melting point of the SPBD as desired. [0034] The surfactant utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition will normally be an anionic surfactant or a nonionic surfactant. Some representative examples of types of anionic surfactants which can be utilized include carboxylates, alkylbenzene sulfonates, alkane sulfonates, Î±-olefin sulfonates, fatty alcohol sulfates, and oxo-alcohol sulfates. Some representative examples of types of nonionic surfactants which can be utilized include alkylphenol ethoxylates, fatty-alcohol polyethyleneglycol ethers, oxo-alcohol polyethyleneglycol ethers, ethylene oxide polymers, propylene oxide polymers, and fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers. It is generally preferred for the surfactant to be an anionic surfactant with alkyl benzene sulfonates, fatty alcohol sulfates, and oxo-alcohol ether sulfates being most preferred. The alkyl benzene sulfonates which are utilized generally have the structural formula: wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 8 to 18 carbon atoms and preferably wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 10 to 13 carbon atoms. The fatty alcohol sulfates which can be utilized normally have the structural formula: R-O-SO\u2083Na wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 6 to 28 carbon atoms and preferably wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 11 to 17 carbon atoms. The oxo-alcohol ether sulfates which can be utilized generally have the structural formula: R- -CH\u2082-Oî€“CH\u2082-CH\u2082-Oî€—nSO\u2083Na wherein n is an integer from 1 to about 4 and wherein R and R\u2032 represent alkyl groups which can be the same or different with the total number of carbon atoms in R and R\u2032 ranging from about 11 to about 13. [0035] The microfluidization procedure utilized results in the formation of a catalyst emulsion composition which has an average particle size which is within the range of about 10 to about 1,000 nanometers. The catalyst emulsion composition prepared will preferably have an average particle size which is within the range of about 30 to about 600 nanometers and will more preferably have an average particle size which is within the range of about 60 to about 300 nanometers. This microfluidization procedure can be carried out utilizing conventional microfluidizers or other equipment which is capable of homogenizing the catalyst emulsion composition to the desired particle size. For instance, the microfluidization can be carried out utilizing a high pressure pump or series of pumps. Ultrasonic and/or mechanical means can be utilized in the microfluidization procedure. To attain the desired particle size, it may be advantageous to pass the catalyst emulsion composition which is being prepared through the Microfluidizer\u0099 more than one time. [0036] The catalyst component solution utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition is stable over long periods of time and can be stored for long periods without losing its activity. However, it is highly desirable to utilize the catalyst emulsion composition as soon as possible after it is prepared because the catalyst emulsion composition loses its activity over time. In practice, the catalyst emulsion composition loses essentially all of its activity after about 24 hours of being stored at room temperature. It is, accordingly, important to use the catalyst emulsion composition as soon as possible after its preparation. [0037] The aqueous reaction mixture is prepared by mixing (1) water, (2) at least one emulsifier, (3) 1,3-butadiene monomer, (4) the catalyst emulsion composition and (5) carbon disulfide and/or phenylthiocyanate. Water is the major component in the aqueous reaction mixture. The amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer in the aqueous reaction mixture will vary from about 2 weight percent to about 50 weight percent. However, in most cases it will be preferred for the aqueous reaction mixture to contain from about 10 weight percent to about 40 weight percent 1,3-butadiene monomer. It will generally be more preferred for the aqueous reaction mixture to contain from about 20 to about 30 weight percent 1,3-butadiene monomer. The amount of emulsifier utilized in preparing the aqueous reaction mixture will normally be within the range of about 0.1 phm to about 10 phm (parts per hundred parts of monomer). It will normally be preferred for the emulsifier to be present in an amount ranging from about 0.5 phm to about 5 phm. In most cases, it will be more preferred for the emulsifier to be present in an amount within the range of about 1 phm to about 3 phm. [0038] The emulsifiers used in the emulsion polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into SPBD may be charged at the outset of the polymerization or may be added incrementally or by proportioning as the reaction proceeds. Generally, anionic emulsifier systems provide good results, however, any of the general types of anionic, cationic or nonionic emulsifiers may be employed in the polymerization. [0039] Among the anionic emulsifiers that can be employed in such emulsion polymerizations are fatty acids and their alkali metal soaps such as caprylic acid, capric acid, pelargonic acid, lauric acid, undecyclic acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, and the like; amine soaps of fatty acids such as those formed from ammonia, mono- and dialkyl amines, substituted hydrazines, guanidine and various low molecular weight diamines; chain-substituted derivatives of fatty acids such as those having alkyl substituents; naphthenic acids and their soaps and the like; sulfuric esters and their salts, such as the tallow alcohol sulfates, coconut alcohol sulfates, fatty alcohol sulfates, such as oleyl sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate and the like; sterol sulfates; sulfates of alkylcyclohexanols, sulfation products of lower polymers of ethylene as C\u2081\u2080 to C\u2082\u2080 straight chain olefins, and other hydrocarbon mixtures, sulfuric esters of aliphatic and aromatic alcohols having intermediate linkages, such as ether, ester, or amide groups such as alkylbenzyl (polyethyleneoxy) alcohols, the sodium salt of tridecyl ether sulfate; alkane sulfonates, esters and salts, such as alkylchlorosulfonates with the general formula RSO\u2082Cl, wherein R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and alkylsulfonates with the general formula RSO\u2082-OH, wherein R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms; sulfonates with intermediate linkages such as ester and ester-linked sulfonates such as those having the formula RCOOC\u2082H\u2084SO\u2083H and ROOC-CH\u2082-SO\u2083H, wherein R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms such as dialkyl sulfosuccinates; ester salts with the general formula: wherein R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms; alkylaryl sulfonates in which the alkyl groups contain preferably from 10 to 20 carbon atoms, e.g. dodecylbenzenesulfonates, such as sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate; alkyl phenol sulfonates; sulfonic acids and their salts such as acids with the formula RSO\u2083Na, wherein R is an alkyl and the like; sulfonamides; sulfamido methylenesulfonic acids; rosin acids and their soaps; sulfonated derivatives of rosin and rosin oil; and lignin sulfonates, and the like. [0040] Carboxylate emulsifiers are highly preferred. This is because their utilization leads to less build-up on the walls of the polymerization reactor. Fatty acid soaps and rosin acid soaps are representative examples of highly preferred carboxylate soaps. Of rosin acids, about 90 percent are isometric with abietic acid and the other 10 percent is a mixture of dehydro abietic acid and dihydro abietic acid. [0041] Agitation should be provided in the preparation of the aqueous reaction mixture to ensure that the catalyst emulsion composition, the monomer, and the surfactant are distributed essentially homogeneously throughout the mixture. Since 1,3-butadiene monomer is very volatile, it will be necessary to prepare the aqueous reaction mixture under pressure in a closed system. [0042] The carbon disulfide or phenyl isothiocyanate is typically the last component to be added to the aqueous reaction mixture. The addition of carbon disulfide and/or phenyl isothiocyanate to the reaction mixture which already contains the catalyst emulsion composition will initiate the polymerization reaction. The amount of carbon disulfide or phenyl isothiocyanate that can be added will vary between 0.005 phm and 2 phm. More preferably, the amount of carbon disulfide added will vary between 0.001 and 1 phm. [0043] In the process of the present invention, the larger the proportion of the carbon disulfide in a range from about 0.0005 phm to about 0.5 phm in the polymerization mixture, the larger the yield of the SPBD obtained from the polymerization mixture. However, too large an amount of carbon disulfide, for example, larger than about 0.5 phm, causes a decrease in the polymer yield. [0044] In the process of the present invention, the crystallinity and melting point of the polybutadiene produced can be controlled by adding alcohols, ketones, nitriles, aldehydes, or amides to the aqueous reaction mixture. In this aqueous emulsion polymerization process, there is a limitation of controlling crystallinity and melting point with agents which are water-soluble. Thus, ethanol and methanol are not as effective as other alcohols which are much less soluble in water than in hydrocarbons. Water soluble agents cannot be used as effectively to control crystallinity and melting point (only hydrocarbon soluble agents can be used). A detailed description of the agents and techniques that are used to control crystallinity and melting points is given in United States Patents 3,901,868 and 4,153,767. These patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. As has been pointed out, water soluble agents, such as ethanol and methanol, are not effective agents. Other alcohols such as, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 1-decanol, and 5-tridecanol, which are not soluble in water, can be used with better success. [0045] The 1,3-butadiene monomer is polymerized into SPBD while agitating the polymerization mixture. If the use of an antioxidant is desired, it may be added conveniently at the beginning of the polymerization. This polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer can be carried out at a temperature from about -20Â°C to about 100Â°C. It is preferable for the polymerization temperature to be from 0Â°C to 60Â°C. The most preferred polymerization temperature is about 10Â°C to about 30Â°C. At temperatures below 0Â°C, an antifreeze agent can be added to the polymerization mixture to keep it from freezing. [0046] This polymerization can be carried out either under a normal pressure or in a pressurized system. This polymerization can be carried out under an inert gas atmosphere, such as a nitrogen atmosphere, with good results. Such a polymerization can be run for a period of from about 3 to about 30 hours. It is generally preferred for the polymerization to be run for a period which is within the range of about 10 to 16 hours. However, the optimum polymerization time will vary greatly with the polymerization temperature, catalyst, the amount of catalyst used, etc. In most cases, the optimum polymerization time will be within the range of about 12 to about 14 hours. [0047] After the polymerization has been completed, the SPBD can be recovered from the latex by standard coagulation techniques. In the alternative, the SPBD latex can be blended with the latices of rubbery elastomers as desired or it can be utilized as the polymerization medium for preparing emulsion rubbers. In any case, the SPBD can be coagulated from the latex by utilizing standard techniques. For instance, coagulation can be accomplished by adding acids or blends of salts with acids to the latex. For example, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, blends of sodium chloride with sulfuric acid and blends of hydrochloric acid with methanol are very effective as coagulating agents. Calcium chloride solutions and blends of calcium chloride with various acids can also be utilized as coagulants. Salt/acid coagulants are generally preferred. For instance, the utilization of sulfuric acid with sodium chloride or potassium chloride as the coagulant will lead to good results. Barium chloride and magnesium sulfate are additional examples of divalent salts which are suitable for utilization in coagulating the SPBD latex. It may also be advantageous to employ materials classified as coagulation aids, such as high molecular weight polyelectrolytes, in the coagulation of the SPBD latex. The preferred coagulation aids are weak bases. Some representative examples of suitable coagulation aids which can be used include Nalco\u0099 108 (Nalco Chemical Company), Daxad\u0099 CP-1 (W. R. Grace and Company), and similar materials that are also weakly basic polyelectrolytes. The quantity of coagulant required will vary with the emulsifier, the amount of emulsifier used, the rubber being coagulated, and the type of coagulant being employed. Generally, the optimum type of coagulant, quantity of coagulant and coagulating conditions can be determined using a trial and error approach. [0048] If a blend of the SPBD with a rubbery elastomer is sought, then the SPBD latex is mixed with a latex of the rubbery elastomer prior to coagulation. The coagulation of such blended latices results in the formation of a highly dispersed blend of SPBD throughout the rubbery elastomer. The amount of SPBD and rubber in the blend is determined by the amount of the various latices which are mixed together. It is, of course, important for the latices to be compatible with each other to prevent undesired reactions from taking place. Blends of SPBD with a wide variety of rubbery elastomers including high cis-1,4-polybutadiene, synthetic polyisoprene, SBR, isoprene-butadiene rubber, nitrile rubber, butyl rubbers, halogenated butyl rubbers, ethylene propylene diene monomer rubbers (EPDM), and ethylene propylene rubbers (EPR) can be made utilizing this technique. [0049] In cases where the SPBD latex is utilized as the polymerization medium for producing emulsion rubbers typically additional water, emulsifiers initiator, and desired monomers will be added thereto. It is, of course, important to select an emulsifier, initiator, and monomers which are compatible with the SPBD latex. The monomers present in the polymerization medium are then polymerized into the rubbery elastomer desired. For instance, this can be done utilizing free radical polymerization techniques. Such polymerizations can be initiated utilizing standard chemical free radical initiators, ultraviolet light, or radiation. [0050] To ensure a satisfactory polymerization rate, uniformity, and a controllable polymerization, free radical initiators are generally used with good results. Free radical initiators which are commonly used include the various peroxygen compounds such as potassium persulfate, ammonium persulfate, benzoyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, di-t-butyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl peroxide, decanoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, p-menthane hydroperoxide, t-butylhydroperoxide, acetyl acetone peroxide, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, succinic acid peroxide, dicetyl peroxydicarbonate, t-butyl peroxyacetate, t-butyl peroxymaleic acid, t-butyl peroxybenzoate, acetyl cyclohexyl sulfonyl peroxide and the like; the various azo compounds such as 2-t-butylazo-2-cyanopropane, dimethyl azodiisobutyrate, azodiisobutyronitrile, 2-t-butylazo-1-cyanocyclohexane, 1-t-amylazo-1-cyanocyclohexane, and the like; the various alkyl perketals, such as 2,2-bis-(t-butylperoxy)butane, ethyl 3,3-bis(t-butylperoxy) butyrate, 1,1-di-(t-butylperoxy) cyclohexane, and the like. Cumene hydroperoxide can be used as an initiator to obtain very good results in the polymerization of carboxylated nitrile rubber. [0051] The emulsion polymerization system used in the synthesis of carboxylated rubbers can be treated at the desired degree of conversion with shortstopping agents, such as hydroquinone. The latex made can then be coagulated using a standard technique. This results in the formation of a highly dispersed blend of the SPBD throughout the rubbery elastomer. [0052] In an alternative embodiment of this invention, SPBD latex can be prepared in the latex of a rubbery elastomer. Such polymerizations are carried out by adding 1,3-butadiene monomer, the catalyst emulsion composition, carbon disulfide and/or phenyl isothiocyanate, and additional emulsifiers if desired to the latex of the rubbery elastomer. A latex containing the SPBD as well as the rubbery elastomer will result. This latex can accordingly be coagulated to form a highly dispersed blend of the SPBD throughout the rubbery elastomer. [0053] This invention is illustrated by the following examples which are merely for the purpose of illustration and are not to be regarded as limiting the scope of the invention or the manner in which it can be practiced. Unless specifically indicated otherwise, parts and percentages are given by weight. Particle sizes reported herein were determined utilizing a Nicomp Model 370 dynamic light scattering unit using automatic sample preparation techniques. Example 1 [0054] In this experiment a latex of SPBD was prepared. The first step of the procedure utilized involved making the catalyst component solution. This was done by charging 7.3 lbs. (3.3 kg) of hexane to a reactor which had been evacuated for 30 minutes. Then 0.61 lbs. (0.28 kg) of cobalt octoate was added with the mixture being agitated. Then 1.3 lbs. (0.59 kg) of 1,3-butadiene was added. After that 3.5 lbs. (1.59 kg) of triethylaluminum was added with the agitation being continued. Cooling was also utilized to keep the temperature of the mixture below about 70Â°F (21Â°C). After all of the triethylaluminum had been added and the temperature fell below 50Â°F (10Â°C). The catalyst component solution which had been prepared was transferred to a clean plastic 5 gallon (18.9 liter) carboy for storage in a cold room until needed. The catalyst component solution was additionally stored under a blanket of nitrogen in the absence of light. [0055] A mixture of the catalyst component solution with a paraffinic oil was then prepared. This was done by mixing 450 grams of the catalyst component solution with 300 grams of a paraffinic process oil. A surfactant solution was also prepared. This was done by mixing 7 lbs. (3.2 kg) of water with 300 grams of an aqueous solution containing 28% sodium lauryl sulfate. The mixture of the oil with the catalyst component solution was then microfluidized with the surfactant solution. This was done in a homogenizer unit made by Microfluidics Corporation. Mixing of the aqueous and organic phases was accomplished utilizing a mixing Tee just ahead of the Microfluidizer\u0099 pump. The homogenization process was continued until an average particle size for the catalyst emulsion composition of about 100 nanometers was attained. The catalyst emulsion composition prepared was determined to contain particles which varied in size from about 60 to about 300 nanometers. [0056] A buffer solution having a pH of about 9.5 was prepared by mixing 20 lbs. (9.1 kg) of water with 1.8 lbs. (0.82 kg) of a tallow fatty acid. The buffer solution was added to a polymerization reactor and 12.5 lbs. (5.7 kg) of 1,3-butadiene monomer was charged into the reactor. The reactor was equipped with two afts with baffles for agitation which was carried out at 150 rpm. The catalyst emulsion composition prepared was charged into the reactor along with 9 grams of carbon disulfide which was dissolved in 391 grams of hexane. The polymerization was carried out at a temperature of about 50Â°F (10Â°C) for a period of 12 to 14 hours. A stable SPBD latex having a solids content of above 20% was produced. Example 2 [0057] In this experiment SPBD latex made by the procedure specified in Example 1 was utilized in the polymerization medium utilized in preparing emulsion SBR. This polymerization was carried out utilizing a 10 gallon (37.9 liter) reactor. The aqueous reaction mixture utilized was prepared by charging 8 lbs. (3.6 kg) of water, 50 lbs. (22.7 kg) of SPBD latex prepared by the procedure described in Example 1, 0.38 lbs. (170 grams) of a tallow fatty acid, 0.38 (170 grams) of a rosin acid, 0.11 lbs. (47.5 grams) of potassium sulfate, 0.04 lbs. (19.2 grams) of sodium naphthalene sulfonate (a dispersing agent), 0.005 lbs. (2.3 grams) of sodium hydrosulfide (an oxygen scavenger), 0.018 lbs. (7.9 grams) of sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate (a reducing agent), 5.63 lbs. (2.54 kg) of styrene, 0.063 lbs. (28.3 grams) of t-dodecylmercaptan (a chain regulator), 0.015 lbs. (6.8 grams) of p-methane hydroperoxide, 13.1 lbs. (5.9 kg) of 1,3-butadiene, and 0.4 grams of a chelated iron salt of tetraethyldiamine tetra-acetic acid which was dissolved in 1.25 lbs. (565 grams) of water. The polymerization was carried out at 50Â°F (10Â°C) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The polymerization was shortstopped when a solids content of about 23% was attained. The polymerization was shortstopped by charging a mixture containing 1 lbs. (452 grams) of water, 0.05 lbs. (22.6 grams) of sodium dithiocarbamate, and 0.05 lbs. (22.6 grams) of diethyl hydroxyl amine into the reactor. [0058] A stable latex containing SPBD and SBR was obtained utilizing this procedure. The latex was coagulated to produce a highly dispersed blend of SPBD with SBR. This experiment shows that SPBD latex can be utilized in the polymerization medium used in preparing emulsion SBR. This procedure provides a convenient means of preparing highly dispersed blends of SPBD in SBR. Example 3 [0059] In this experiment a highly dispersed blend of SPBD in nitrile rubber was prepared. This was done by utilizing SPBD latex made by the procedure described in Example 1 as part of the polymerization medium. [0060] This polymerization was carried out in a 10 gallon (37.9 liter) laboratory polymerization reactor. The polymerization medium was prepared by charging 22.7 kg of SPBD latex made by the procedure described in Example 1, 3.6 kg of water, 282.5 grams of a tallow fatty acid, 33.9 grams of tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 7.9 grams of sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, 2.8 kg of acrylonitrile, 50.9 grams of t-dodecylmercaptan, 7.9 grams of p-methanehydroperoxide, 5.7 kg of 1,3-butadiene, and 0.4 grams of a chelated iron salt of tetraethylene diamine tetracetic acid which was dissolved in 565 grams of water. The polymerization was carried out at 50Â°F (10Â°C) under a nitrogen atmosphere with agitation being applied. When a solids content of about 28% was attained, the polymerization was shortstopped by charging a solution containing 452 grams of water, 22.6 grams of sodium dithiocarbamate, and 22.6 grams of diethylhydroxyl amine into the reactor. [0061] A latex containing both SPBD and nitrile rubber was prepared in this experiment. It could be coagulated to obtain a highly dispersed blend of SPBD in nitrile rubber. The latex prepared utilizing this procedure was very stable. This experiment shows that SPBD latex can be utilized as a major component of the polymerization medium in which emulsion nitrile rubber is prepared. Comparative Example 4 [0062] The procedure utilized in Example 1 was repeated in this experiment except that the paraffinic process oil was not utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition. In this experiment the polybutadiene produced did not contain a significant amount of syndiotactic 1,2-microstructure. In fact, the polybutadiene produced was a rubbery polymer. This experiment shows that it is necessary to utilize an oil in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition. If the oil is not utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition, SPBD is not produced in polymerizations which are initiated utilizing the catalyst. [0063] While certain representative embodiments and details have been shown for the purpose of illustrating the subject invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in this art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the scope of this invention."

        "text": "Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to 1,2-polybutadiene compositions curable to flame retarded resin materials and to cured flame retarded 1,2-polybutadiene resin materials. The cured products in accordance with the invention exhibit an improved flame retardancy performance over the cured 1,2-polybutadiene, while retaining desirable properties of the cured 1,2-polybutadiene, such as high heat resistance and excellent dielectric properties. Preferred cured products in accordance with the invention further exhibit a thermal expansion coefficient lower than that of the cured 1,2-polybutadiene. 2. Description of the Prior Art Because of their excellent electrical properties, in particular dielectric properties, and excellent resistances to heat, water and chemicals, 1,2-polybutadiene and cured products thereof are widely used in parts of electrical and electronic devices and equipment as a substrate of a printed circuits board, a coating resin for printed circuits, a molding compound or an insulating varnish. Nevertheless, 1,2-polybutadiene and cured products thereof have a drawback in that they are readily burnable since their molecules are solely composed of hydrogen and carbon atoms. For parts of electrical and electronic devices and equipment, a certain level of flame retardancy performance has been recently required as a standard, and the flame retardation of 1,2-polybutadiene has now been one of the most important problems in the art. Most of the prior art approaches for the flame retardation of 1,2-polybutadiene are unsatisfactory in that a sufficient flame retardancy performance is not achieved or can only be achieved with the sacrifice of desirable properties inherently possessed by 1,2-polybutadiene. For example, methods for the flame retardation of 1,2-polybutadiene based on the use of addition-type flame retardants, such as hexabromobenzene, decabromodiphenyl ether and triphenyl phosphate, optionally together with auxiliary flame retardants, such as antimony trioxide and triphenylantimony, result not only in impairment of desirable dielectric properties and heat resistance inherently possessed by 1,2-polybutadiene, but also in undesirable bleeding out of the flame retardant to the surfaces of the cured resin. On the other hand, methods for the flame retardation of 1,2-polybutadiene based on the use of reactive flame retardants, such as 2,4,6-tribromophenylacrylate or -methacrylate, are proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Specifications 50-30,019, published on Mar. 26, 1975, and 50-32,241, published on Mar. 28, 1975, as well as in examined Japanese Patent Publication 53-21,433, published on July 3, 1978. By these methods, however, the flame retardancy performance is not durable although the initial level of flame retardancy performance is satisfactory. Furthermore, while the desirable dielectric properties of 1,2-polybutadiene can be retained, the high heat resistance inherently possessed by 1,2-polybutadiene is adversely affected. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, a primary object of the invention resides in the flame retardation of 1,2-polybutadiene without the sacrifice of desirable electrical and other properties inherently possessed by 1,2-polybutadiene. Thus, in accordance with one aspect of the invention there is provided a composition curable to a flame retarded resin material, which comprises: A. a butadiene polymer wherein at least 50% of the recurring units consist of 1,2-butadiene units; B. 40 to 200 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of said butadiene polymer, of at least one reactive flame retardant selected from the group consisting of bisphenol bisacrylate compounds having the formula: ##STR1## wherein X represents Br or Cl, Y represents H or --CH3, and m and n each is an integer from 1 to 4, and A represents a direct bond --O--, --CO--, --SO2 --, --Ch2)b, wherein b is an integer from 1 to 4, --CHâ•CH-- ##STR2## polymers of such bisphenol bisacrylate compounds; and C. a curing-promoting amount of an organic peroxide. A preferred composition further comprises: D. 10 to 150 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of said butadiene polymer, of at least one modifier selected from the group consisting of bismaleimide compounds having the formula: ##STR3## wherein R represents a divalent aromatic radical having up to 70 carbon atoms, and polymers of such bismaleimide compounds. In accordance with another object of the invention there is provided a cured flame retarded resin material exhibiting a flame retardancy performance of V-1 or V-0, as measured according to the Underwriters Laboratories Standard UL 94 using the Vertical Burning Test, which material is obtained by curing the composition of the invention. A preferred resin material has a thermal expansion coefficient of less than 1Ã—10-4 /Â° C. and is obtained by curing the preferred composition. The cured resin material in accordance with the invention can be in the form of a prepreg laminate. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIG. 1 shows the average burn time as a function of the amount of flame retardant. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The essential component A of the composition according to the invention is a butadiene polymer wherein at least 50%, preferably at least 80%, of the recurring units consist of 1,2-butadiene units of the formula: ##STR4## Such a butadiene polymer is cross-linkable due to the presence of the double bond in each 1,2-butadiene unit. The molecular weight of the butadiene polymer is not critical. Commercially available 1,2-polybutadiene products, including normally liquid products having a number-average molecular weight of 1000 to 5000 and normally solid products having a number-average molecular weight of 50000 to 200000 and a melting point of 50Â° to 200Â° C., are usable in the practice of the invention. The structural units of the butadiene polymer, other than the 1,2-butadiene units, may be 1,4-butadiene or epoxidized 1,2-butadiene units. An epoxidized 1,2-polybutadiene obtainable by partial epoxidation of 1,2-polybutadiene and having the formula: ##STR5## wherein n is an integer of at least 1 and preferably from 4 to 200, m is an integer from 1 to 20, and when n is more than 1, the m's may be equal or different, and having an epoxy equivalency of 150 to 550, has been found to be also useful in the practice of the invention. Such an epoxidized 1,2-polybutadiene is also commercially available, and can be used alone or in combination with other 1,2-polybutadiene products. The essential component B of the composition according to the invention is a reactive flame retardant selected from the bisphenol bisacrylate compounds of the formula (I) and polymers thereof. Examples of the compounds of the formula (I) include, for example, the following. 2,2-bis(4-methacryloyl-3,5-dibromophenyl)propane, 2,2-bis(4-acryloyl-3,5-dibromophenyl)propane, 2,2-bis(4-methacryloyl-3,5-dichlorophenyl)propane, 2,2-bis(4-acryoyl-3,5-dichlorophenyl)propane, 4,4'-diacryloyl-3,3',5,5'-tetrabromodiphenylsulfon, 4,4'-dimethacryloyl-3,3'-dichlorodiphenylsulfon, 4,4'-dimethacryloyl-3,3',5,5'-tetrabromodiphenylmethane, 4,4'-dimethacryloyl-3,3'5,5'-tetrabromodiphenylketone, 4,4'-dimethacryloyl-3,3'-dibromodiphenylbutane, 4,4'-dimethacryloyl-2,2', 3,3',5,5',6,6'-octachlorophenyl ether, and 4,4'-diacryloyl-3,3'5,5'-tetrachlorodiphenyl Preferred reactive flame retardants are bisphenol bisacrylate compounds of the formula (I'): ##STR6## wherein A' is --SO2 -- or ##STR7## and Y, m and n have the same meanings as defined above with respect to the formula (I), and polymers of such bisphenol bisacrylate compounds. The most preferred reactive flame retardant is 2,2-bis(4-methacryloyl-3,5-dibromophenyl)propane or its polymer. The reactive flame retardants used in the invention are known in the art and described in Japanese Patent Laid-open Specification 53-55393, published on May 19, 1978. However, this laid-open specification states that satisfactory results are not obtained when the bisphenol bisacrylate compounds are used as a sole flame retardant, and is completely silent with respect to the flame retardation of 1,2-polybutadiene. The reactive flame retardant must be used in an amount of 40 to 200 parts, preferably 60 to 120 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the butadiene polymer. In a series of experiments according to the general procedure described in Example 1, the amount of the reactive flame retardant used, 2,2-bis(4-methacryloyl-3,5-dibromophenyl)propane, was varied. The average burn time, measured in accordance with the Underwriters Laboratories Standard UL 94 using the Vertical Burning Test on the cured samples, was plotted against the amount of the flame retardant. The results are shown in FIG. 1. From these results and in view of the fact that the dielectric properties of the cured product tend to be adversely affected when the amount of the flame retardant substantially exceeds 200 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the 1,2-polybutadiene, we have selected the above-mentioned proportion of the reactive flame retardant. The essential component C is an organic peroxide. Those known for the curing of 1,2-polybutadiene can be used in the practice of the invention in known amounts. Illustrative of typical organic peroxides are benzoyl peroxide, 1,1-bis(t-butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, dicumyl peroxide, t-butylperoxy benzoate, t-butylperoxyoxide, di-t-butylperoxydi-isopropyl benzene, and 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di-t-butylperoxyhexine-3. In addition to the above-mentioned components A, B and C, the curable composition according to the invention may contain other curable polymers, such as epoxy resin, in an amount of up to 20% by weight of the butadiene polymer. A minor part of the reactive flame retardant may be replaced by other reactive flame retardants, such as tribromophenyl acrylate or methacrylate, and/or addition-type flame retardants may be jointly used, although such modifications are not preferred. When an epoxidized 1,2-polybutadiene and/or an additional epoxy resin is used, the composition may contain a curing agent, such as an acid anhydride or polyamine, normally used for the curing of epoxy resins. The composition may further contain up to 10% by weight of a styrene derivative, such as styrene, chlorostyrene, ethylvinylbenzene and divinylbenzene. Addition of such a styrene derivative has been found effective not only in reducing the viscosity of the composition but also in shortening the required cure time. In preferred embodiments, the curable composition contains up to 150 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the butadiene polymer, of a modifier selected from the bismaleimide compounds of the formula (II) and polymers of such bismaleimide compounds. In these preferred embodiments, a thermal expansion coefficient lower than that of the cured 1,2-polybutadiene (2.2Ã—10-4 /Â° C.) can be achieved while enjoying the advantages of the invention. Preferred modifiers are bismaleimide compounds having the formula (II'): ##STR8## wherein R' represents a divalent aromatic radical selected from the group consisting of ##STR9## wherein c is an integer from 0 to 5, and polymers of such bismaleimide compounds. Illustrative of the bismaleimides are: N,N'-m-phenylene-bismaleimide, N,N'-p-phenylene-bismaleimide, N,N'-4,4'-diphenylmethane-bismaleimide, N,N'-4,4'-diphenylsulfon-bismaleimide, and; N,N'-4,4'-m-xylene-bismaleimide. These bismaleimides may be prepared according to the process described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,444,536. Equimolar reaction products of these bismaleimides with aromatic diamines, having a melting point ranging between 50 and 200Â° C., may also be used as the modifier. Another example of the useful bismaleimide is a poly(phenylmethylene)polymaleimide of the formula: ##STR10## wherein n is an integer from 0 through 5. In order to achieve a significantly reduced thermal expansion coefficient, the modifier should be used in an amount of at least 10 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the butadiene polymer. The use of an excessive amount of the modifier should be avoided, or otherwise the desirable electrical properties possessed by 1,2-polybutadiene will be impaired. Normally we prefer to use 30 to 100 parts of the modifier based on the weight of the butadiene polymer. The curable composition of the invention may be in the form of a varnish with the ingredients dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as toluene, tetrahydrofuran and trichloroethylene. While the curable composition according to the invention can be used in casting and molding shaped articles, it is particularly useful for the production of prepreg laminate, and copper clad laminate. In such applications, a fibrous reinforcing sheet, such as a glass cloth, glass mat, glass paper, glass non-woven fabric, woven or non-woven fabric of synthetic fibers or asbestos sheet, may be impregnated with the composition of the invention in the form of varnish, and dried at a temperature of 50 to 200Â° C., preferably 80Â° to 150Â° C., to form a non-tacky prepreg. A plurality of such prepregs may be stacked, optionally sandwiched between copper foils, and then cured to a prepreg laminate or copper clad laminate at a temperature of 100Â° to 200Â° C. and a pressure of 1 to 100 kg/cm2. Thus, the curable composition may be in the form of prepreg, and the cured resin material may be in the form of prepreg laminate. The cured resin material of the invention exhibits a flame retardancy performance of V-1 or V-0, as measured according to the Underwriters Laboratories Standard UL 94 using the Vertical Burning Test, while retaining desirable electrical properties and heat resistance inherently possessed by 1,2-polybutadiene. This was unexpected and surprising when compared with the results obtained in Control 2, wherein a mono-functional reactive flame retardant, 2,4,6-tribromophenyl acrylate was used. Because of its monofunctionality, this flame retardant significantly reduces the crosslinking density of 1,2-polybutadiene, and the tribromophenyl groups are present in the cured product as pendants without forming a part of the crosslinking chain. It is believed that for these reasons, the thermal stability of 1,2-polybutadiene is impaired. Furthermore, the flame retardant in itself has a thermal decomposition temperature of about 160Â° C., which is much lower than that of 1,2-polybutadiene (about 315Â° C.). Accordingly, it is believed that the flame retarding moieties in the cured product will start to decompose at a temperature much lower than the temperature at which the 1,2-polybutadiene moieties in the cured product begin to decompose. Upon first ignition of the sample, non-flammable gases would evolve before quantities of flammable gases evolve, and thus the sample would be self-extinguishing. Whereas upon second ignition, the non-flammable gases would have already been consumed, and thus the sample would be burning. In contrast, the flame retardant used in the invention is difunctional, and thus, the flame retarding groups enter the crosslinking chain. For this reason it is believed that the thermal stability of 1,2-polybutadiene would not be adversely affected. Furthermore, the flame retardant, 2,2-bis(4-methacryloyl-3,5-dibromophenyl)propane, has a thermal decomposition temperature of about 280Â° C., which is close to that of 1,2-polybutadiene (315Â° C.). Accordingly, it is believed that temperatures at which non-flammable gases evolve from flame retarding moieties would not significantly differ from temperatures at which flammable gases evolve from 1,2-polybutadiene moieties, and thus, the relative proportion of both non-flammable and flammable gases could be maintained relatively constant, and the sample would be self-extinguishing upon second ignition as well. The invention will be further described by the following Examples and Controls, in which parts are by weight unless otherwise specified. EXAMPLE 1 Liquid casting compositions Nos. 1 through 6 were prepared by mixing a low molecular weight atactic 1,2-polybutadiene (\"NISSO-PB-B3000\" provided by Nippon Soda Co., Ltd., wherein at least 90% of the recurring units consist of 1,2-butadiene units, and which has a number-average molecular weight of about 3000), styrene, dicumyl peroxide (\"Percumyl D\" provided by Nippon Oil & Fats Co., Ltd.), 2,2-bis(4-acryloyl-3,5-dibromophenyl) propane (hereinafter referred to as Compound A) and 2,2-bis(4-methacryloyl-3,5-dibromophenyl) propane (hereinafter referred to as Compound B), in respective amounts (parts by weight) as indicated in Table 1. Each composition was poured into a space formed by two \"Teflon\" (in the following the names in quotations comprise trademarks) surfaces arranged in parallel and spaced apart from each other by a distance of about 1.6 mm, and heated for 5 hours in total at temperatures of 120Â° C., 130Â° C., 140Â° C., 150Â° C. and 16Â° C. one hour at each temperature) to form a cured sheet. The properties obtained from the cured sheets of these compositions are recorded in Table 1. The flame retardancy performance was measured according to the Underwriters Laboratories Standard UL94 using the Vertical Burning Test on samples which had been cut from the cured sheets and had a thickness of 1.6 mmÄ…0.2 mm, a width of 12.7Ä…0.5 mm and a length of 127Ä…1 mm. Five samples were used for one test. The thermal decomposition temperature, at which loss in weight of the polymer begins, was determined from TG curves obtained by thermal gravimetric analysis on finely divided samples with a heating rate of 10Â° C./min. The dielectric constant was measured by a mutual induction bridge method in accordance with JIS K 6911.

(Â°C.)______________________________________ From the results shown in Table 1, it is revealed that the flame retardancy performance of the cured resin is enhanced as the proportion of Compound A and/or B increases; that when compared with the cured resin consisting of 1,2-polybutadiene, the dielectric constant of the cured resins according to the invention does not substantially increase, and that the heat resistance of the cured resin reflected by the thermal decomposition temperature is slightly but not significantly lowered by the addition of the flame retardant. The addition of styrene appears preferable in reducing the lowering of the heat resistance. EXAMPLE 2 Curable compositions Nos. 7 through 10 were prepared by mixing a high molecular weight syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene (\"JSR-RB 810\" provided by Japan Synthetic Rubber Co., Ltd. wherein at least 90% of the recurring units consist of 1,2-butadiene units and which has a number-average molecular weight of about 120000), Compound B and 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di-t-butylperoxyhexane (\"Perhexine 25B\" provided by Nippon Oil & Fats Co., Ltd.) in respective parts by weight as indicated in Table 2, and milling on a roll mill at temperatures of 140Â° to 150Â° C. Each composition was pressed in a mold at a temperature of 200Â° C. for 2 hours to form a cured sheet of about 1.6 mm in thickness. Strips of 127Ä…1 mm in length and 12.7 mmÄ…0.5 mm in width were cut from the sheets for the burning test. The properties of the cured sheets were tested in the manner as described in Example 1. The results are shown in Table 2.

EXAMPLE 3 Following the procedure described in Example 1, a cured resin sheet was prepared from Composition No. 4 except that the Compound B in Composition No. 4 was replaced with the same amount of 4,4'-dimethacryloyl-3,3',5,5'-tetrabromodiphenylmethane. The cured resin sheet exhibited a flame retardancy performance of UL 94 V-O and had similar dielectric constant and thermal decomposition temperature to those obtained from Composition No. 4. EXAMPLE 4 Following the procedure described in Example 1, Composition No. 4 was cast into a cured sheet, but the Compound B in Composition No. 4 was replaced by the same amount of an equiweight mixture of 4,4'-dimethacryloyl-3,3',5,5'5tetrabromodiphenylsulfon and 4,4'-dimethacryloyl-3,3'-dibromodiphenylmethane. Similar results were obtained. EXAMPLE 5 A mixture of 40 parts of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene (\"JSR-RB 810\"), 40 parts of N,N'-4,4'-diphenylmethane bismaleimide, 20 parts of Compound B and 5 parts of dicumyl peroxide was milled on a roll mill at a temperature of 105Â° C. After cooling, the mixture was finely divided and then hot-pressed in a closed mold at 180Â° C. for 2 hours and after-cured at 200Â° C. for 2 hours to form a cured resin board having a dimension of 3 mmÃ—100 mmÃ—100 mm. As measured in accordance with JIS K 6911, the cured resin board had a dielectric constant of 2.88 (1 MHZ, 25Â° C.), a dielectric loss tangent of 0.007 (1 MHZ, 25Â° C.) and a water absorption of 0.13% by weight. The thermal expansion coefficient as measured by a light interference method (25Â°-300Â° C.) was 4.9Ã—10-5 /Â° C. According to the Underwriters Laboratories Standard using the Vertical Burning Test, it was rated as UL 94 V-1 with an average burn time of 15.2 seconds and a maximum burn time of 23.0 seconds. For a comparative purpose, a mixture of 40 parts of the 1,2-polybutadiene, 40 parts of the bismaleimide and 2.4 g of the peroxide was processed to prepare a cured resin board, which was tested in the same manner. While the product had a dielectric constant of 2.80 (1 MHZ, 25Â° C.), a dielectric loss tangent of 0.006 (1 MHZ, 25Â° C.) and a water absorption of 0.14% by weight, it was rated as \"Burning\" in accordance with the UL 94 test. EXAMPLE 6 The processing and test procedures as described in Example 5 were repeated except that the bismaleimide modifier used in Example 5 was replaced with the same amount of a product which had been obtained by reacting the bismaleimide with 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane. The cured resin board exhibited a dielectric constant of 2.86 (1 MHZ, 25Â° C.), a dielectric loss tangent of 0.006 (1 MHZ, 25Â° C.), a water absorption of 0.11% by weight, and a thermal expansion coefficient of 5.2Ã—10-5 /Â° C., and was rated as UL 94 V-1 with an average burn time of 12.8 seconds and a maximum burn time of 19.5 seconds. EXAMPLE 7 The processing and test procedures as described in Example 5 were repeated except that the bismaleimide modifier used in Example 5 was replaced with the same amount of \"Bismaleimide M\", supplied by Mitsui Toatsu Chemical Co., Ltd. and being a poly(phenylmethylene)polymaleimide of the formula: ##STR11## wherein n is an integer from 0 through 5, according to the supplier's information. The cured resin board so obtained exhibited a dielectric constant of 2.85 (1 MHZ, 25Â° C.), a dielectric loss tagent of 0.006 (1 MHZ, 25Â° C.), a water absorption of 0.11% by weight and a thermal expansion coefficient of 5.4Ã—10-5 /Â° C., and was rated as UL 94 V-1 with an average burn time of 13.4 seconds and a maximum burn time of 21.0 seconds according to the UL Standard Vertical Burning Test. For a comparative purposes the procedures of Example 5 were repeated except that the bismaleimide modifier was omitted and the peroxide was used in an amount of 2.4 parts instead of 5 parts. The product had a thermal expansion coefficient of 2.0Ã—10-4 /Â° C., while its other properties tested were comparable to those of the products obtained using the bismaleimide modifiers. EXAMPLE 8 A mixture of 50 parts of an epoxidized 1,2-poly-butadiene having a number average molecular weight of about 1000 and an epoxy equivalent of about 200 (\"BF-1000\" provided by Adeka Argus Chemical Co., Ltd. and being obtainable by partial epoxidation of an atactic 1,2-polybutadiene in which at least 90% of the recurring units consist of 1,2-butadiene units), 30 parts of a bismaleimide prepolymer having a melting point of 80Â° C.

The composition was compression-molded at a temperature of 160Â° C. and a pressure of 30 Kg/cm2 for one hour into discs having a thickness of 3 mm and a diameter of 60 mm, and then post-cured at 200Â° C. for 2 hours. The cured resin product was tested for various properties in the manner as described in Examples 1 and 5. The product exhibited a dielectric constant of 2.8, a dielectric loss tangent of 0.005, a water absorption of 0.12% by weight, a thermal expansion coefficient of 8.5Ã—10-5 /Â° C. and a thermal decomposition temperature of 250Â° C., and was rated as UL 94 V-O in accordance the Underwriters Laboratories Standard using the Vertical Burning Test. While the Burning Test was conducted on samples of 60 mm in length, the samples were self-extinguished before the burning extended about 40 mm or less.

The composition was poured into a \"Teflon\" mold maintained at a temperature of 100Â° C. and vacuum deareated. The mold was heated for 12 hours in total at temperatures of 150Â° C., 160Â° C., 170Â° C., 180Â° C., 190Â° C. and 200Â° C. (2 hours at each temperature) to form a cured resin board of 100 mm square and 3 mm thick. The cured resin product was tested for various properties in the manner as described in Examples 1 and 5.

The cured resin product exhibited a dielectric constant of 3.12, a dielectric loss tangent of 0.006, a water absorption of 0.18% by weight, a thermal expansion coefficient of 6.8Ã—10-5 /Â° C. and a thermal decomposition temperature of 310Â° C., and was rated as UL 94 V-1 with an average burn time of 9.8 seconds and a maximum burn time of 13.2 seconds. EXAMPLE 12 A varnish was prepared by dissolving 100 parts of a high molecular weight syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene (\"JSR-PB 810), 100 parts of 2,2-ibs(4-methacryloyl-3,5-dibromophenyl)propane and 6 parts of dicumyl peroxide in 800 parts of trichloroethylene. A glass cloth substrate (\"Nittobo WE-116E-103\") provided by NITTO BOSEKI Co., Ltd) was impregnated with the varnish and dried at a temperature of 120Â° C. for 10 minutes to provide a non-tacky prepreg. Eight prepregs so produced were stacked and cured for 2 hours to a prepreg laminate at a temperature of 200Â° C. and a pressure of 60 Kg/cm2. EXAMPLE 13 A glass cloth substrate (\"Nittobo WE-116E-104\") was impregnated with a varnish prepared from 100 parts of a high molecular weight syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene (\"JSR-RB 810\"), 30 parts of a low molecular weight atactic 1,2-polybutadiene (\"NISSO-PB-B 1000\" provided by Nippon Soda Co., Ltd., in which at least 90% of the recurring units consist of 1,2-butadiene units and which has a number-average molecular weight of about 1000), 100 parts of 4,4'-dimethacryloyl-3,3',5,5'-tetrabromodiphenylmethane,7 parts of 1,1-bis(t-butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane and 650 parts of toluene, and dried at a temperature of 100Â° C. for 10 minutes to provide a non-tacky prepreg. From 8 prepregs so obtained, a prepreg laminate was prepared in the same manner as described in Example 12. EXAMPLE 14 A varnish was prepared by dissolving 100 parts of a high molecular weight syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene (\"JSR-RB-810\"), 20 parts of a low molecular weight atactic 1,2-polybutadiene (\"NISSO-PB-B 1000\"), 100 parts of 2,2-bis4-acryloyl-3,5-dibromophenyl)propane and 6 parts of 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-t-butylperoxyhexine-3 in 600 parts of trichloroethylene. Non-tacking prepregs were obtained by impregnation of glass cloth substrates (\"Nittobo WE-116E-104\") and non-woven glass fabric substrates (\"EP-4050\" supplied by Japan Vilene Co., Ltd.) with the varnish, followed by 10 minutes drying at 120Â° C. Six prepregs made from non-woven glass fabric were stacked and sandwiched between two glass cloth prepregs. The assembly was cured for two hours to a prepreg laminate at a temperature of 200Â° C. and a pressure of 40 Kg/cm2. EXAMPLE 15 Glass cloth prepregs were prepared in the manner as described in Example 13 from a varnish composed of 100 parts of a high molecular weight syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene (\"JSR-RB 810\"), 20 parts of a low molecular weight atactic 1,2-polybutadiene (\"NISSO-PB-B 3000\"), 120 parts of 2,2-bis(4-methacryloyl-3,5-dibromophenyl)propane, 120 parts of styrene, 6 parts of 1,1-bis(t-butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcohexane and 750 parts of trichloroethylene. Eight prepregs so prepared were stacked and the stack was sandwiched between two electrolytic copper foils (supplied by Furukawa Circuit Foil Co., Ltd.). The assembly was cured for 1 hour to a copper clad laminate at a temperature of 180Â° C. and a pressure of 50 Kg/cm2. The addition of styrene allowed the required cure time to be reduced to 1 hour. The strength for peeling the copper foil was 1.0 Kg/cm2. Control 1 This is a control example wherein no flame retardant was used. Following the procedure as described in Example 12, a prepreg laminate was prepared using a varnish composed of 100 parts of a high molecular weight syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene (\"JSR-RB- 810\"), 40 parts of a cyclized 1,4-polybutadiene (\"JSR-CLBR\" provided by Japan Synthetic Rubber Co., Ltd.; this component was added to impart flexibility to the product), 5 parts of dicumyl peroxide and 600 parts of trichloroethylene. Control 2 This is a control example wherein a monofunctional reactive flame retardant was used instead of the difunctional reactive flame retardant according to the invention. Following the procedure as described in Example 12, a prepreg laminate was prepared using a varnish composed of 100 parts of a high molecular weight syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene (\"JSR-PB 810\"), 100 parts of 2,4,6-tribromophenyl acrylate, 6 parts of dicumyl peroxide and 650 parts of trichloroethylene.

EXAMPLE 16 Using prepregs prepared as in Example 15, a six-layered circuit board was prepared. Three prepregs were stacked and sandwiched by two copper foils. The assembly was cured under heat and pressure as in Example 15 to form a copper clad laminate having a thickness of 0.38 mm, which was then provided with circuit patterns of the width level of 0.2 mm by a usual etching technique. Three such patterned copper clad laminates were stacked, with two prepregs between each adjacent pair of laminates. The assembly was pressed for 1 hour at a temperature of 180Â° C. and a pressure of 60 Kg/cm2 to provide the desired multi-layered circuit board. The product exhibited the same general properties as those indicated in Table 3 in the column designated as Example 15. For the inner layer circuit pattern, the characteristics impedance was 84 Î© and the propagation delay time was 5.0 ns/m.

No. 10/494,601 filed Jun. 27, 2005, now abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part of international application PCT/US02/35402 filed Nov. 5, 2002, which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/338,840 filed on Nov. 5, 2001, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND The present invention is directed toward a process for producing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers. The present invention is also directed to a polymer composition comprising a blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and a terpolymer polymerized from ethylene, at least one Î±-olefin monomer, and at least one diene monomer. Tire sidewalls protect the ply and are therefore preferably resistant to weathering, ozone, abrasion, and tearing, while providing excellent flex fatigue resistance. Typical tire sidewall formulations include natural rubber (NR), styrene-butadiene (SBR), butadiene (BR), and halogenated butyl (HIIR). Ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer (EPDM) is attractive because of its resistance to weathering and ozone. EPDM, however, is not compatible with butadiene rubber and fillers, and has poor cut growth resistance. Blends of EPDM with crystalline polymers have shown improved cut growth properties at room temperature. At elevated temperatures, however, these materials have poor cut growth properties. Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene (sPB) is a crystalline thermoplastic resin that has a stereoregular structure in which the side-chain vinyl groups are located alternately on the opposite sides in relation to the polymeric main chain. sPB uniquely exhibits the properties of both plastics and rubber, and therefore it has many uses. It can also be blended into and co cured with natural and synthetic rubbers. Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene can be made by solution, emulsion, or suspension polymerization. Generally, syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene has a melting temperature within the range of about 195Â° C. to about 215Â° C., but due to processability considerations, it is generally desirable for syndiotactic 1,2 polybutadiene to have a melting temperature of less than about 195Â° C. Because syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is insoluble in common solvents at normal polymerization temperatures, a common technical difficulty in the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene is that the polymerization mixture is an extremely thick slurry at the commercially desirable polymer concentration of 10% to 25% by weight. This thick slurry becomes difficult to stir and transfer, thereby diminishing heat transfer efficiency and interfering with proper process control. Also, the slurry contributes to reactor fouling due to the undesirable build-up of insoluble polymer on the baffles, agitator blades, agitator shafts, and walls of the polymerization reactor. It is therefore necessary to clean the reactor on a regular basis, which results in frequent shutdowns of continuous processes and serious limitations of the run length of batch processes. The task of cleaning the fouled reactor is generally difficult and time-consuming. All of these drawbacks detrimentally affect productivity and the cost of operation. The physical properties of rubbery elastomers can be improved by blending crystalline polymers therein. For example, incorporating syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene into rubber compositions that are utilized in the supporting carcass of tires greatly improves the green strength of those compositions. Also, incorporating syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene into tire tread compositions can reduce heat build-up and improve wear characteristics of tires. The green strength of synthetic rubbers such as cis-1,4-polybutadiene can also be improved by incorporating a small amount of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Blends of crystalline polymers and rubbery elastomers are typically prepared by standard mixing techniques. For example, these blends can be prepared by mixing or kneading and heat-treating a crystalline polymer and a rubbery elastomer by utilizing generally known mixing equipment such as a Banbury mixer, a Brabender mixer, an extruder, a kneader, or a mill mixer. These high-temperature mixing procedures, however, have certain drawbacks including high processing costs, polymer degradation and crosslinking, inadequate mixing, as well as various process limitations. Due to the high vinyl content of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene, polymer degradation and crosslinking is a particularly severe problem for mixing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene with elastomers at high temperatures. Attempts to polymerize 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement have been hampered by catalyst inefficiencies and toxicities. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,379,889 teaches polymerizing 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement by using a catalyst system comprising a cobalt compound, a dialkylaluminum halide, carbon disulfide, and an electron donative compound. And, U.S. Pat. No. 5,283,294 teaches a similar process that employs a catalyst system comprising a cobalt compound, an organoaluminum compound, and carbon disulfide. These methods, however, are inferior because the catalyst systems that are employed suffer from low catalytic activity, poor stereoselectivity, the need for toxic, halogenated solvents, and the many drawbacks associated with carbon disulfide including low flash point, obnoxious smell, high volatility and toxicity. Therefore, it would be advantageous to develop a new and significantly improved process for producing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In general, the present invention provides a process for preparing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers comprising the steps of (1) providing a mixture of a rubber cement and 1,3-butadiene monomer; and (2) polymerizing the 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement by using a catalyst composition that is formed by combining, (a) a chromium-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organomagnesium compound or (a) a molybdenum-containing compound or an iron-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organoaluminum compound. The present invention further provides a process for preparing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers comprising the steps of (1) providing a mixture of a rubber cement and 1,3-butadiene monomer, where the rubber cement comprises an elastomeric terpolymer polymerized from ethylene, at least one-olefin monomer, and at least one diene monomer; and (2) preparing a catalyst composition, where the catalyst composition is prepared by combining, outside the presence of the mixture of rubber cement and monomer, (a) a chromium-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organomagnesium compound or (a) a molybdenum-containing compound or an iron-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organoaluminum compound; and (3) adding the catalyst composition to the mixture and thereby polymerizing the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement. Advantageously, the process of this invention directly provides blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers by synthesizing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement and thereby obviates the need for high-temperature mixing. Also, good dispersion of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene throughout rubbery elastomers can be easily and economically achieved. Significantly, the process of this invention eliminates the problems of high processing costs, polymer degradation and crosslinking, inadequate mixing, and various process limitations that are associated with high-temperature mixing procedures. The process of this invention also alleviates the problems of polymer cement thickness and reactor fouling that are associated with the synthesis of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in the absence of a rubbery elastomer. In addition, the catalyst systems employed in this invention have very high catalytic activity and stereoselectivity for the syndiospecific polymerization of 1,3-butadiene. This activity and selectivity, among other advantages, allows syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to be produced in very high yields within a rubber cement. Additionally, these catalyst compositions do not contain carbon disulfide, and therefore the toxicity, objectionable smell, dangers, and expense associated with the use of carbon disulfide are eliminated. Further, the chromium, molybdenum, and iron compounds are generally stable, inexpensive, relatively innocuous, and readily available. Furthermore, these catalyst compositions have high catalytic activity in a wide variety of solvents including the environmentally preferred nonhalogenated solvents such as aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons. Furthermore, blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and elastomeric terpolymers polymerized from ethylene, at least one Î±-olefin monomer, and at least one diene monomer, prepared by the process of the present invention, exhibit improved cut growth resistance at elevated temperatures. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS The present invention is generally directed toward a process for producing blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers. Blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers can be directly produced by polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2 polybutadiene within a rubber cement by using chromium-based, molybdenum-based, or iron-based catalyst compositions. The process includes the steps of: (1) providing a mixture of a rubber cement and 1,3-butadiene monomer, where the rubber cement includes at least one rubbery elastomer within an organic solvent, and (2) polymerizing the 1,3 butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement by using a chromium-based, molybdenum-based, or iron-based catalyst composition. The chromium-based catalyst composition is formed by combining (a) a chromium-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organomagnesium compound. The molybdenum-based catalyst composition is formed by combining (a) a molybdenum-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organoaluminum compound. The iron-based catalyst composition is formed by combining (a) an iron-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organoaluminum compound. The rubber cement employed in this invention is a solution, preferably viscous, of at least one rubbery elastomer in an organic solvent. Virtually any type of rubbery elastomer can be used to prepare the rubber cement. In a preferred embodiment, the rubbery elastomer includes an elastomeric terpolymer polymerized from ethylene, at least one Î±-olefin monomer, and at least one diene monomer. The Î±-olefins may include, but are not limited to, propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-octene, 1-decene, or combinations thereof. The diene monomers may include, but are not limited to, 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene, 1,4-hexadiene, 5-methylene-2-norbornene, 1,6-octadiene, 5-methyl-1,4-hexadiene, 3,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadiene, 1,3-cyclopentadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, dicyclopentadiene, 5-vinyl-2-norbornene and the like, or a combination thereof. When the terpolymer is polymerized from ethylene, propylene, and at least one diene monomer, the polymer may be referred to as EPDM. Elastomeric terpolymers prepared from ethylene, at least one Î±-olefin monomer, and at least one diene monomer may be prepared by methods known in the art, and they are commercially available under the tradenames Vistalon\u0099 (Exxon Mobil Chemical Co.; Houston, Tex.), Keltan\u0099 (DSM Copolymers; Baton Rouge, La.), Nordel\u0099 IP (DuPont Dow Elastomers; Wilmington, Del.), ElastoFlo\u0099 (Union Carbide; Danbury, Conn.), and Buna\u0099 (Bayer Corp.; Germany). The elastomeric terpolymers described above may be used in combination with each other, or other rubbery elastomers. Examples of other rubbery elastomers include, but are not limited to, natural rubber, low-vinyl polybutadiene, cis-1,4-polybutadiene, amorphous 1,2-polybutadiene, low-vinyl polyisoprene, cis-1,4-polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, neoprene, ethylene-propylene copolymer rubber (EPR), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), styrene-isoprene rubber (SIR), styrene-isoprene-butadiene rubber (SIBR), styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SBS), styrene-butadiene block copolymer (SB), hydrogenated styrene butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SEBS), hydrogenated styrene-butadiene block copolymer (SEB), styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer (SIS), styrene-isoprene block copolymer (SI), hydrogenated styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer (SEPS), hydrogenated styrene-isoprene block copolymer (SEP), polysulfide rubber, acrylic rubber, urethane rubber, silicone rubber, epichlorohydrin rubber, and the like. Mixtures of the above rubbery elastomers may also be used. These rubbery elastomers are well known and, for the most part, are commercially available. Also, those skilled in the art will be able to readily synthesize these rubbery elastomers by using techniques that are well known in the art. The rubber cement can be prepared by dissolving the rubbery elastomers in an organic solvent. When commercially available rubbery elastomers are employed to prepare the rubber cement, it may be necessary to purify the commercial products before use in order to remove residual water and additives that may become catalyst poisons in the subsequent step of polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement. In one embodiment, the rubber cement is prepared in situ by polymerizing one or more appropriate monomers into rubbery elastomers in an organic solvent within the same reactor that is subsequently used for polymerizing 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Many methods of synthesizing rubbery elastomers are known in the art. Preferably, however, the catalyst utilized in preparing the rubbery elastomers should not contain any ingredients that may interfere with the catalyst subsequently used in the step of polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement. In preparing the rubber cement, it is desirable to select an organic solvent that is inert with respect to the catalyst systems that will be employed to synthesize the rubbery elastomers and the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Suitable types of organic solvents that can be utilized in preparing the rubber cement include, but are not limited to, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, and aromatic hydrocarbons. Some representative examples of suitable aliphatic solvents include n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, n-decane, isopentane, isohexanes, isoheptanes, isooctanes, 2,2-dimethylbutane, petroleum ether, kerosene, petroleum spirits, and the like. Some representative examples of suitable cycloaliphatic solvents include cyclopentane, cyelohexane, methylcyclopentane, methylcyclohexane, and the like. Some representative examples of suitable aromatic solvents include benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, diethylbenzene, mesitylene, and the like. Commercial mixtures of the above hydrocarbons may also be used. For environmental reasons, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic solvents are highly preferred. The concentration of the rubbery elastomers in the rubber cement varies depending on the types of the rubbery elastomers and organic solvent employed. The concentration of the rubbery elastomers within the cement is preferably from about 5% to about 35% by weight of the rubber cement, more preferably from about 10% to 30% by weight of the rubber cement, and even more preferably from about 15% to about 25% by weight of the rubber cement. The rubber cement is then utilized as a polymerization medium for the stereospecific polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. Thus, 1,3-butadiene monomer, catalyst composition, and optionally additional organic solvent are added to the rubber cement. The order in which the 1,3-butadiene monomer, the catalyst composition, and the solvent are added to the rubber cement does not limit the scope of the invention, although it may be preferable to add the catalyst composition, or at least an ingredient thereof, prior to adding the 1,3-butadiene monomer. The amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer added to the rubber cement is contingent upon the proportion of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene desired in the resultant polymer blend. The additional organic solvent can be selected from the group of the organic solvents mentioned above for the preparation of the rubber cement, and may be the same as or different from the organic solvent used in preparing the rubber cement. The addition of 1,3-butadiene monomer to the rubber cement may not be required in the case where 1,3-butadiene monomer is employed to prepare the rubbery elastomers and the polymerization is stopped before all the 1,3-butadiene is consumed, thereby providing the remaining 1,3-butadiene monomer for synthesizing the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene without the need to add additional 1,3-butadiene monomer. Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention is directed toward the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within a rubber cement, other conjugated diene monomers can be polymerized to form conjugated diene polymers, preferably crystalline polymers, within a rubber cement. Chromium-based catalyst compositions useful for the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,201,080 and 6,117,956, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Aluminoxanes are well known in the art and comprise oligomeric linear aluminoxanes that can be represented by the general formula: and oligomeric cyclic aluminoxanes that can be represented by the general formula: where x is an integer of 1 to about 100, preferably about 10 to about 50; y is an integer of 2 to about 100, preferably about 3 to about 20; and each R6, which may be the same or different, is a mono-valent organic group that is attached to the aluminum atom via a carbon atom. Preferably, each R6 is a hydrocarbyl group such as, but not limited to, alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, substituted cycloalkenyl, aryl, allyl, substituted aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, and alkynyl groups, with each group preferably containing from 1 carbon atoms, or the appropriate minimum number of carbon atoms to form the group, up to about 20 carbon atoms. These hydrocarbyl groups may contain heteroatoms such as, but not limited to, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus atoms. It should be noted that the number of moles of the aluminoxane as used in this application refers to the number of moles of the aluminum atoms rather than the number of moles of the oligomeric aluminoxane molecules. This convention is commonly employed in the art of catalysis utilizing aluminoxanes. In general, aluminoxanes can be prepared by reacting trihydrocarbylaluminum compounds with water. This reaction can be performed according to known methods, such as (1) a method in which the trihydrocarbylaluminum compound is dissolved in an organic solvent and then contacted with water, (2) a method in which the trihydrocarbylaluminum compound is reacted with water of crystallization contained in, for example, metal salts, or water adsorbed in inorganic or organic compounds, and (3) a method in which the trihydrocarbylaluminum compound is added to the monomer or monomer solution that is to be oligomerized, and then water is added. Examples of aluminoxane compounds include methylaluminoxane (MAO), modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), ethylaluminoxane, butylaluminoxane, isobutylaluminoxane, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Isobutylaluminoxane is particularly useful on the grounds of its availability and its solubility in aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon solvents. Modified methylaluminoxane can be formed by substituting about 20-80% of the methyl groups of methylaluminoxane with C2 to C12 hydrocarbyl groups, preferably with isobutyl groups, by using techniques known to those skilled in the art. Iron-based catalyst compositions are described in co-pending patent application U.S. Ser. No. 09/172,305, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,180,734 and 6,211,313, which are incorporated herein by reference. The iron-based catalyst compositions are formed by combining (a) an iron-containing compound, (b) a hydrogen phosphite, and (c) an organoaluminum compound. Various iron-containing compounds or mixtures thereof can be employed as ingredient (a) of the iron-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention. Iron-containing compounds that are soluble in a hydrocarbon solvent such as aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons are preferably used. Hydrocarbon-insoluble iron-containing compounds, however, can be suspended in the polymerization medium to form the catalytically active species, and are therefore also useful.

Divalent iron compounds (also called ferrous compounds), wherein the iron is in the +2 oxidation state, and trivalent iron compounds (also called ferric compounds), wherein the iron is in the +3 oxidation state are preferred.

The term \u0093organoiron compound\u0094 refers to any iron compound containing at least one iron-carbon bond. Some specific examples of suitable organoiron compounds include bis(cyclopentadienyl)iron(II) (also called ferrocene), bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)iron(II) (also called decamethylferrocene), bis(pentadienyl) iron(II), bis(2,4-dimethylpentadienyl) iron(II), bis(allyl) dicarbonyliron(II), (cyclopentadienyl) (pentadienyl)iron(II), tetra(1-norbornyl)iron(IV), (trimethylenemethane)tricarbonyliron(II), bis(butadiene)carbonyliron(0), butadienetricarbonyliron(0), and bis(cyclooctatetraene)iron(0). Useful hydrogen phosphite compounds that can be employed as ingredient (b) of the iron-based catalyst composition utilized in this invention are either acyclic hydrogen phosphite, cyclic hydrogen phosphites, or mixtures thereof. These compounds are described above. Useful organoaluminum compounds that can be employed as ingredient (c) of the molybdenum-based catalyst composition, described above, are also suitable for use as ingredient (c) of the iron-based catalyst composition. The catalyst compositions utilized in this invention have very high catalytic activity for polymerizing 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene over a wide range of total catalyst concentrations and catalyst ingredient ratios. The polymers having the most desirable properties, however, are obtained within a narrower range of total catalyst concentrations and catalyst ingredient ratios. Further, it is believed that the three catalyst ingredients (a), (b), and (c) can interact to form an active catalyst species. Accordingly, the optimum concentration for any one catalyst ingredient is dependent upon the concentrations of the other catalyst ingredients. With respect to the chromium-based catalyst composition, the molar ratio of the hydrogen phosphite to the chromium-containing compound (P/Cr) can be varied from about 0.5:1 to about 50:1, more preferably from about 1:1 to about 25:1, and even more preferably from about 2:1 to about 10:1. The molar ratio of the organomagnesium compound to the chromium-containing compound (Mg/Cr) can be varied from about 1:1 to about 50:1, more preferably from about 2:1 to about 30:1, and even more preferably from about 3:1 to about 20:1. With respect to the molybdenum-based or iron-based catalyst compositions, the molar ratio of the hydrogen phosphite to the molybdenum containing compound (P/Mo) or to the iron-containing compound (P/Fe) can be varied from about 0.5:1 to about 50:1, more preferably from about 1:1 to about 25:1, and even more preferably from about 2:1 to about 10:1. Where ingredient (c) of the catalyst composition comprises an organoaluminum compound defined by the formula AlRnX3-n, the molar ratio of the organoaluminum compound to the molybdenum-containing compound (Al/Mo) or to the iron-containing compound (Al/Fe) can be varied from about 1:1 to about 100:1, more preferably from about 3:1 to about 50:1, and even more preferably from about 5:1 to about 25:1. When ingredient (c) of the catalyst composition utilized in the present invention comprises an aluminoxane, the molar ratio of the aluminoxane to the molybdenum-containing compound (Al/Mo) or to the iron-containing compound (Al/Fe) can be varied from about 5:1 to about 500:1, more preferably from about 10:1 to about 200:1, and even more preferably from about 20:1 to about 100:1. The catalyst composition is preferably formed by combining the three catalyst ingredients (a), (b), and (c). Although an active catalyst species is believed to result from this combination, the degree of interaction or reaction between the various ingredients or components is not known with any great degree of certainty. Therefore, it should be understood that the term \u0093catalyst composition\u0094 has been employed to encompass a simple mixture of the ingredients, a complex of the various ingredients that is caused by physical or chemical forces of attraction, a chemical reaction product of the ingredients, or a combination of the foregoing. The catalyst composition utilized to prepare the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene can be formed by combining or mixing the catalyst ingredients or components by using, for example, one of the following methods: First, the catalyst composition may be formed in situ by adding the three catalyst ingredients to the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and 1,3-butadiene monomer in either a stepwise or simultaneous manner. When adding the catalyst ingredients in a stepwise manner, the sequence in which the ingredients are added is not critical. With regard to the chromium-based catalyst, the organomagnesium compound is preferably added first, followed by the chromium-containing compound, and then followed by the hydrogen phosphite. With regard to the molybdenum-based or iron-based catalyst, the molybdenum-containing or iron-containing compound is preferably added first, followed by the hydrogen phosphite, and then followed by the organoaluminum compound. Second, the three catalyst ingredients may be pre-mixed outside the polymerization system at an appropriate temperature, which is generally from about âˆ’20Â° C. to about 80Â° C., and the resulting catalyst composition is then added to the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and 1,3-butadiene monomer. Third, the catalyst composition may be pre-formed in the presence of conjugated diene monomer. That is, the three catalyst ingredients are pre-mixed in the presence of a small amount of conjugated diene monomer at an appropriate temperature, which is generally from about âˆ’20Â° C. to about 80Â° C. The amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer that is used for the catalyst pre-forming can range from about 1 to about 500 moles, more preferably from about 4 to about 100 moles, and even more preferably from about 10 to about 50 moles per mole of the chromium-containing, molybdenum-containing, or iron-containing compound. The resulting catalyst composition is then added to the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and the 1,3-butadiene monomer that is to be polymerized. Fourth, as a further variation, the catalyst composition can also be formed by using a two-stage procedure. The first stage involves combining the chromium-containing compound and the organomagnesium compound or the molybdenum-containing or iron-containing compound and the organoaluminum compound, in the presence of a small amount of conjugated diene monomer at an appropriate temperature, which is generally from about âˆ’20Â° C. to about 80Â° C. In the second stage, the foregoing reaction mixture and the hydrogen phosphite are charged in either a stepwise or simultaneous manner to the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and the 1,3-butadiene monomer that is to be polymerized. Fifth, an alternative two-stage procedure may also be employed. A chromium-ligand, molybdenum-ligand, or iron-ligand, complex is first formed by pre-combining the chromium-containing compound, molybdenum-containing compound, or iron-containing and the hydrogen phosphite compound. Once formed, the chromium complex is then combined with the organomagnesium compound, or the molybdenum or iron complex is combined with the organoaluminum compound, respectively, to form the active catalyst species. The complex can be formed separately or in the rubber cement containing the rubbery elastomer and the 1,3-butadiene monomer that is to be polymerized. This complexation reaction can be conducted at any convenient temperature at normal pressure, but for an increased rate of reaction, it is preferred to perform this reaction at room temperature or above. The time required for the formation of the complex is usually within the range of about 10 minutes to about 2 hours after mixing the chromium-containing, molybdenum-containing or iron-containing compound with the hydrogen phosphite compound. The temperature and time used for the formation of the complex will depend upon several variables including the particular starting materials and the solvent employed. Once formed, the complex can be used without isolation from the complexation reaction mixture. If desired, however, the complex may be isolated from the complexation reaction mixture before use. Sixth, the three catalyst ingredients may be added to the rubber cement prior to or simultaneously with the addition of 1,3-butadiene monomer. When a solution of the catalyst composition or one or more of the catalyst ingredients is prepared outside the polymerization system as set forth in the foregoing methods, an organic solvent or carrier is preferably employed. Useful organic solvents are described above. Organic solvents may serve to dissolve the catalyst composition or ingredients, or the solvent may simply serve as a carrier in which the catalyst composition or ingredients may be suspended. The production of blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers according to this invention is accomplished by polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer within the rubber cement by using a catalytically effective amount of at least one of the foregoing catalyst compositions. The total catalyst concentration to be employed in the polymerization mass depends on the interplay of various factors such as the purity of the ingredients, the polymerization temperature, the polymerization rate and conversion desired, and many other factors. Accordingly, a specific total catalyst concentration cannot be definitively set forth except to say that catalytically effective amounts of the respective catalyst ingredients should be used. Generally, the amount of the chromium-containing, molybdenum-containing, or iron-containing compound used can be varied from about 0.01 to about 2 mmol per 100 g of 1,3-butadiene monomer, more preferably from about 0.02 to about 1.0 mmol per 100 g of 1,3-butadiene monomer, and even more preferably from about 0.05 to about 0.5 mmol per 100 g of 1,3-butadiene monomer. In performing the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement, a molecular weight regulator may be employed to control the molecular weight of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to be produced. As a result, the scope of the polymerization system can be expanded in such a manner that it can be used for the production of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene having a wide range of molecular weights. Suitable types of molecular weight regulators that can be utilized include, but are not limited to, Î±-olefins such as ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, and 1-octene; accumulated diolefins such as allene and 1,2-butadiene; nonconjugated diolefins such as 1,6-octadiene, 5-methyl-1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene, 3,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, 4-vinylcyclohexene, 1,4-pentadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-hexadiene, 1,6-heptadiene, 1,2-divinylcyclohexane, 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene, 5-methylene-2-norbornene, 5-vinyl-2-norbornene, dicyclopentadiene, and 1,2,4-trivinylcyclohexane; acetylenes such as acetylene, methylacetylene and vinylacetylene; and mixtures thereof. The amount of the molecular weight regulator used, expressed in parts per hundred parts by weight of the 1,3-butadiene monomer (phm), is from about 0.01 to about 10 phm, more preferably from about 0.02 to about 2 phm, and even more preferably from about 0.05 to about 1 phm. The molecular weight of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene to be produced can also be effectively controlled by conducting the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer in the presence of hydrogen gas. In this case, the partial pressure of hydrogen gas is preferably from about 0.01 to about 50 atmospheres. The polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement may be carried out as a batch process, a continuous process, or even a semi-continuous process. In the semi-continuous process, 1,3-butadiene monomer is intermittently charged as needed to replace that monomer already polymerized. In any case, the polymerization is desirably conducted under anaerobic conditions by using an inert protective gas such as nitrogen, argon or helium, with moderate to vigorous agitation. The polymerization temperature may vary widely from a low temperature, such as âˆ’10Â° C. or below, to a high temperature such as 100Â° C. or above, with a preferred temperature range being from about 20Â° C. to about 90Â° C. The heat of polymerization may be removed by external cooling, cooling by evaporation of the 1,3-butadiene monomer or the solvent, or a combination of the two methods. Although the polymerization pressure employed may vary widely, a preferred pressure range is from about 1 atmosphere to about 10 atmospheres. Once a desired conversion is achieved, the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the rubber cement can be stopped by adding a polymerization terminator that inactivates the catalyst system. Typically, the terminator employed to inactivate the catalyst system is a protic compound, which includes, but is not limited to, an alcohol, a carboxylic acid, an inorganic acid, water, or a combination thereof. An antioxidant such as 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol may be added along with, before or after the addition of the terminator. The amount of the antioxidant employed is usually in the range of 0.2% to 1% by weight of the polymer product. When the polymerization reaction has been stopped, the blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and the rubbery elastomer can be recovered from the polymerization mixture by utilizing conventional procedures of desolventization and drying. For instance, the blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and the rubbery elastomer may be isolated from the polymerization mixture by coagulation of the polymerization mixture with an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol, or by steam distillation of the solvent and the unreacted 1,3-butadiene monomer, followed by filtration. The product is then dried to remove residual amounts of solvent and water. The polymer blend produced is a highly dispersed blend of crystalline syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in the rubbery elastomer. Advantageously, the catalyst composition employed in this invention can be manipulated to vary the characteristics of the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in the polymer blend. Namely, the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in the polymer blend made by the process of this invention can have various melting temperatures, molecular weights, 1,2-linkage contents, and syndiotacticities, all of which are dependent upon the selection of the catalyst ingredients and the ingredient ratios. The blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers produced with the process of this invention have many uses. For example, these blends can be utilized in rubber compositions that are used to manufacture the supporting carcass, innerliner, sidewall, and tread of tires. The blends of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and rubbery elastomers are also useful in the manufacture of films and packaging materials and in many molding applications. In a preferred embodiment, the blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in rubbery elastomer is added to rubber compositions that are useful in the manufacture of tires. As is generally known in the art, these rubber compositions or tire formulations include a base rubber, filler, vulcanizing agent, and sundry additional additives that are common in rubber compounding. Both synthetic and natural rubber may be employed within the rubber compositions. These rubbers, which may also be referred to as elastomers, include, without limitation, natural rubber, synthetic polyisoprene, poly(styrene-co-butadiene), polybutadiene, poly(styrene-co-butadiene-co-isoprene), poly(styrene-co-isoprene), and mixtures thereof. The rubber compositions may include fillers such as inorganic and organic fillers. Organic fillers include carbon black. Inorganic fillers include silica, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and clays (hydrated aluminum silicates). A multitude of rubber vulcanizing agents, which are also referred to as curing agents, can be employed within these rubber compositions. For example, sulfur or peroxide-based curing systems may be employed. Also, see Kirk Othmer, ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY, 3rd Edition, Wiley Interscience, 30 N.Y. 1982, Vol. 20, pp. 365-468, particularly VULCANIZATION AGENTS AND AUXILIARY MATERIALS pp. 390-402, or Vulcanization by A. Y. Coran, ENCYCLOPEDIA OF POLYMER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, 2nd Edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1989, which are incorporated herein by reference. Vulcanizing agents may be used alone or in combination. The rubber compositions may also include other compounding additives such as accelerators, oils, waxes, scorch inhibiting agents, processing aids, antidegradants, zinc oxide, optional tackifying resins, optional reinforcing resins, optional fatty acids, and optional peptizers. In one preferred embodiment, a blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and EPDM, prepared according to the process of this invention, is employed with a rubber composition that is useful for the manufacture of tire sidewalls. The preferred blend includes from about 0.4 to about 12 parts by weight SPB and from about 99.6 to about 88 parts by weight EPDM. More preferably, the blend includes from about 2 to about 10 parts by weight SPB and from about 98 to about 90 parts by weight EPDM. When practicing this embodiment, the blend is combined and compounded with a base rubber in an amount from about 1 to about 40 parts by weight blend phr, preferably from about 2 to about 20 parts by weight phr, and even more preferably from about 5 to about 10 parts by weight blend phr. Sidewall formulations also typically include a filler, which is employed in an amount from about 10 to about 70 parts by weight phr, preferably from 20 about 20 to about 60 parts by weight phr, and more preferably from about 25 to about 50 parts by weight phr. The syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within the EPDM rubbery elastomer that is utilized in tire sidewall formulations preferably has a melting temperature from about 70 to about 210Â° C., more preferably from about 90 to about 195Â° C., and even more preferably from about 110Â° C. to about 190Â° C. Fillers are typically employed in an amount from about 1 to about 100 parts by weight phr, and preferably from about 20 to about 90 parts by weight phr, and more preferably from about 40 to about 80 parts by weight pier. Those skilled in the art will be able to choose a useful amount of the other ingredients that may be employed in these rubber compositions. For example, it is generally known in the art of making tire components that sulfur is typically employed in an amount from about 0.5 to about 10 parts by weight phr, and preferably from about 1 to about 6 parts by weight phr. Oils are typically employed in an amount from about 1 to about 60 parts by weight phr, and preferably in an amount from about 1 to about 50 parts by weight phr. Zinc oxide is typically employed in an amount from about 0.5 to about 8 by weight phr, and preferably from about 1 to about 5 parts by weight phr. Rubber formulations are compounded by using mixing equipment and procedures conventionally employed in the art. Preferably, an initial masterbatch is prepared that includes the rubber component and the reinforcing fillers, as well as other optional additives such as processing oil and antidegradants. The blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and EPDM is preferably added during preparation of the initial masterbatch. This masterbatch is typically mixed at temperatures in excess of about 100 or 150Â° C. To prevent premature vulcanization, also known as scorch, the initial masterbatch generally excludes the vulcanizing agent. Once the initial masterbatch is prepared, the vulcanizing agent is blended into the composition at lower temperatures. Rubber compounding techniques and the additives employed therein are generally known as disclosed in The Compounding and Vulcanization of Rubber, by Stevens in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY SECOND EDITION (1973 Van Nostrand Reihold Company). The mixing conditions and procedures applicable to silica-filled tire formulations are also well known as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,227,425; 5,719,207; 5,717,022, as well as EP 0890606, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The rubber compositions can then be processed into tire components, including sidewalls, according to ordinary tire manufacturing techniques including standard rubber molding and curing techniques. Typically, vulcanization is effected by heating the vulcanizable composition in a mold; e.g., it is heated to about 170Â° C. Cured or crosslinked rubber compositions may be referred to as vulcanizates, which generally contain three-dimensional polymeric networks that are thermoset. The other ingredients, such as fillers, oils, and antidegradants, are generally dispersed throughout the network. While the blends of this invention are preferably added to formulations used to make tire sidewalls, the blend can also be used within other tire components such as treads, subtreads, body ply skims, bead fillers and the like. Pneumatic tires can be made as discussed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,866,171; 5,876,527; 5,931,211; and 5,971,046, which are incorporated herein by reference. In order to demonstrate the practice of the present invention, the following examples have been prepared and tested as described in the Examples disclosed hereinbelow. The examples should not, however, be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. The claims will serve to define the invention. EXAMPLES Example 1 Preparation of sPB/EPDM Blend A highly dispersed blend of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene and EPDM was prepared by polymerizing 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene within an EPDM rubber cement. The EPDM rubber cement was prepared by dissolving 50 g of EPDM to form a solution containing 15% by weight solids by dissolving in 300 grams of hexane. The EPDM contained about 56% ethylene, about 6% 5-ethylidene-2-norborene, had a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 60,000 and a Mooney Viscosity (ML1+4@100Â° C.) of about 35. At room temperature, adding 12 grams of a 1,3-butadiene/hexane blend containing 22.4% by weight of 1,3-butadiene were added to the EPDM rubber cement produced above. The polymerization of the 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene was initiated by the addition of 6.25 mL of 0.032 M iron(III) 2-ethylhexanoate in hexanes, 0.27 mL of 2.93 M bis(2-ethylhexyl) hydrogen phosphite in hexanes, and 6.0 mL of 0.68 M triisobutylaluminum in hexanes. The polymerization was conducted at 50Â° C. for 6 hours. The polymerization was stopped by the addition of 3 mL of isopropanol diluted with 50 mL of hexanes. The polymerization mixture was added into 10 liters of isopropanol containing 12 g of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. The polymer blend of 3% syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in EPDM was isolated by filtration and dried to a constant weight under vacuum of 60Â° C. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed a broad Tm peak, between 190Â°-205Â° C., that was attributed to the formation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. A blend containing 6% syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in EPDM and a blend containing 12% syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene in EPDM were prepared exactly as above, except that the amounts of 1,3-butadiene monomer and catalyst components were adjusted. Analysis showed that SPB did form within the EPDM as evidenced by melting temperature peaks (Tm) within a DSC curve. Example 2 Preparation of a 6% sPB/EPDM Blend Approximately 50 grams of an EPDM sample (E/P=55/45, Mn=60 k, the diene is 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene or ENB, 6%) was dissolved in 450 mL of hexanes to form a solution containing 15% solids. A mixture of 1,3-butadiene (Bd) monomer in hexanes was charged (5.0 grams total of Bd) followed by the addition of Fe(EHA)3 (0.1 mmol) in hexanes, HPO(OEH)2 (0.4 mmol) in hexanes and TIBA (2 mmol) in hexanes. The mixture was agitated at 50Â° C. for 6 hours. The reaction mixture was poured into isopropyl alcohol with agitation, isolated, air-dried, and then vacuum-dried to remove any remaining solvent. The polymer mixture was analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) which revealed a broad Tm peak (Tm=190-205Â° C.) attributed to the formation of the sPB.

Tearing Energy (J/m2) 1210 1145 Dc/Dn (nm/cycle) was measured in a \u0093pure shear\u0094 geometry with a precut [Reference: Lake G J, Rubber Chemistry and Technology, 68: (3), 435-460, 1995]. The testing sheet had a length of 20.32 cm, a height of 64.5 mm and a thickness of 2 mm. A pre-cut of 4.0 cm was made along the length direction. Cyclic deformation was applied along the height direction with a strain amplitude of 2.5% to 25%, and with a frequency of 1 to 100 Hz. The testing condition was a 40 Hz half-sinusoidal pulse for a 5 Hz deformation cycle under 10% strain amplitude at various temperatures (23Â° C.-80Â° C.). Images of the propagating crack were recorded automatically at a given interval of about 10,000 cycles. Crack growth rate (dc/dn) is then calculated by the increment of crack length at each cycle (nm/cycles). This type of cut growth rate of 45 and below is advantageous in many applications.

Said rubber composition is prevented from cold-flow. 6 Claims, No Drawings RUBBER COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING ClS-POLYBUTADIENE AND 1,2-POLYBUTADIENE This invention relates to a cis-polybutadiene composition which is prevented from cold-flow. More particularly, this invention relates to a cis-polybutadiene composition which is prevented from cold-flow and which consists essentially of cis-polybutadiene and 1,2- polybutadiene. For recent several years, cis-polybutadiene (referred to hereinafter as cis-BR) has been commercially available, and the cis-BR has a higher tendency of coldflow than other synthetic rubbers, for example, styrenebutadiene rubber, and are inconvenient in handling because the package of the composition gets out of shape during storage particularly in summer, and unvulcanized intermediate products are deformed. In order to remove said disadvantages, thefollowing ways have been considered: using cis-BR having a higher molecular weight or having a wider molecular weight distribution, and increasing the amount of branched chains in the molecule. However, these ways require complicated polymerization operation, resulting in anincrease of production cost. Therefore, these ways have not been desired. In addition, blending polyethylene into the cis-BR has been proposed (see Japanese Pat. No. 531,921). However, the composition obtained by this way is inferior in properties other than cold-flow though it is improved in cold-flow. The present inventors have done extensive research on cis-BR to find that by blending cis-BR with 1,2 polybutadiene highly compatible therewith, the coldflow of cisBR is greatly improved. It is the object of the invention to provide a cispolybutadiene composition which is prevented from cold-flow. According to the present invention, there is provided a cis-polybutadiene composition which consists essentially of 97 to 80 percent by weight of cispolybutadiene and v3 to 20 percent by weight of 1,2- polybutadiene having a 1,2-addition units content of 70 percent or higher and crystallinity of 5 percent or higher. The 1,2-polybu-tadiene used in this invention has a 1,2-addition units content of 70 percent or higher, preferably 85 percent or higher, and crystallinity of 5 percent or higher, preferably 10 to 50 percent. lts molecular weight can be selected from a wide range, so both liquid and solid polymers may be used, though it is preferably to use a polymer having an intrinsic viscosity ([11]) of 0.7 dl/g or higher (determined in toluene at 30C). Said 1,2-polybutadiene can be prepared by the methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,498,963 and 3,522,332. When the 1,2-addition units content or the crystallinity is outside the above-mentioned range, the effect of this invention cannot be obtained. In this invention, the proportion of cis-BR to the 1,2- polybutadiene is 97-80/3-20 (weight ratio), and when the amount of the 1,2-polybutadiene is smaller than 3 percent by weight of the composition, no substantial effect of this invention can be obtained. Further, up to 20 percent by weight of the 1,2-polybutadiene is sufficient to prevent the cold flow of cis-BR. Commercially available cis-BR may be used as the cis-BR in this invention, and an oil-extended cis-BR may also be used. in this invention, the method of'blending the 1,2 polybutadiene with cis-BR has no particular restriction. For instance, solutions of both components may be blended with each other followed by removing the solvents, or alternatively, both components in the form of solids may be blended with each other by a conventional method, for example, by means of roll, Banburys mixer or kneader to obtain a similar result. The cis-polybutadiene composition of this invention is greatly improved in cold flow and also improved in green strength, extrudability and mill shrinkage. Further, the vulcanizate of the composition is improved in physical properties, such as hardness and the like. Therefore, the composition of this invention is very usefull. It is, of course, possible to further incorporate into the composition of this invention at least one conventional compounding ingredient, such as reinforcing agents, fillers, extender oils, pigments, vulcanizing agents, vulcanizing accelerators, vulcanizing activators, antioxidants, ultraviolet absorbers, blowing agents. odorants, softening agents, etc. The invention is further explained below in more detail with reference to Examples, which are not by way of limitation but by way of illustration. The characteristic properties of the 1.2- polybutadienes used in the Examples are as follows: The micro-structures of the above polybutadienes were measured by the infrared absorption spectrum method of'D. Moreo, et al., [Chimie et Ind., 41, 758 (1959)]. The crystallinity was determined by the density measurement method in which the following equation was used: where d density of the specimen measured at 20\"C 11 densityof the crystalline region d density of the amorphous region X crystallinity in percent The value of d used was that of the crystalline 1,2- polybutadiene calculated by Natta from X-ray experiments to be 0.963 [6. Natta: J. Polymer Sci., 20, 251 (1956)]. The value of d,,,,, used was 0.892, or the density of the. 1 ,2-polybutadiene obtained by the synthesizing process proposed in US. Pat.

Rieve, Schooleys Mountain, N.J., assignors to Allied Chemical Corporation, New York, N.Y. No Drawing. Filed Sept. 23, 1969, Ser. No. 860,406 Int. Cl. (308d 3/06 US. Cl. 260-943 5 Claims ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE Polybutadiene compositions of melting point 50100 C. with the major proportion of the butadiene content being combined in the 1,2 form. The co-ingredient is rubbery, amorphous butadiene polymer having vinyl double bonds and internal double bonds. The process of making employs as catalyst a complex of a cobalt compound with butadiene or open chain butadiene dimer and with an organo metallic compound of zinc, lithium or aluminum; and a catalyst modifier of fumaric acid ester or maleic acid ester. The copolymers are formulated to molding compounds which can be cured rapidly and used in transfer molding. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to 1,2-polybutadiene compositions, i.e. compositions wherein the major constituent is the divalent butadiene unit, combined principally in the 1,2 form, i.e. the form which provides a vinyl group pendant from the polymer chain probably in syndiotactic form, i.e. successive vinyl groups alternate in position between the two possible stereoisomeric positions (dand l-) upon successive segments of the chain. Thus the major proportion of the butadiene content of the composition is combined in the form of the units: CH3 tin Homopolymers of 1,2-butadiene are known, including the syndiotactic and the isotactic forms-Montecatini British Pat. 835,752 published May 25, 1960, and Montecatini British Pat. 854,615 published Nov. 23, 1960. These known homopolymers are relatively high melting, having melting points of about 154 C., and 124 C., respectively when in purified form. These homopolymers are useful in molding compositions; but their high melting point makes them difficult to process in that temperatures higher than those attainable by hot water or steam are required for blending these homopolymers with other materials, such as curing agents employed in molding compositions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Compositions in accordance with the invention overcome the above noted difficulties of processing to obtain molding compositions and the like, by virtue of their showing fusion within the temperature range broadly between about 50 C. and about 100 C. These compositions display a high rate of curability in the presence of peroxy curing agents. Moreover the compositions of the present invention have high flow characteristics so that they will readily fill an intricate mold. Furthermore the temperatures suitable for curing molding compositions, formulated from the compositions of the invention with peroxy curing agents, are relatively high (at least 120 C. and suitably 160-190 C.) so that molding compositions thereof can be formulated without premature cure 3,504,361 Patented July 20, 1971 ICE and can be charged in the fused state to a mold, e.g. 1 PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Typically in preferred embodiments of the composition of the invention at least 65% of the double bonds are vinyl double bonds. For production of the copolymers of the invention, it is preferred to make up a solution in hydrocarbon solvent of a cobalt compound together with say about l-lO times its weight of butadiene. Then an organometallic compound is added, preferably in proportions of about ll0 mols per mol of the cobalt compound. A particularly suitable cobalt compound is bis-acetylacetonate; and particularly suitable organo metallic compounds are triethylaluminum and triisobutylaluminum. This catalyst mixture, after allowing time for complex formatibn between the ingredients as indicated by color change, is mixed with additional butadiene and stirred while the butadiene is polymerized to amorphous mixed 1,2- and 1,4-polybutadiene. Then fumaric ester or maleic ester, e.g. in benzene solution, is added preferably in proportion of about 1-3 mols per mol of cobalt compound. Particularly suitable esters are dialkyl fumarates having C C alkyl groups. The polymerization is then conducted in the resulting solution by supplying butadiene at temperatures from about 0 C. to about C., especially 1070 C. These operations are conducted under a dry nitrogen atmosphere. The catalyst is deactivated and unreacted materials are extracted by use of a low boiling alcohol such as isopropanol, suitably containing acid; and the product is washed, suitably with methanol. The wash liquid should contain an antioxidant such as an aromatic amine or a phenolic antioxidant to protect the isolated polymer during subsequent handling. EXAMPLES The examples which follow are illustrative of the invention and of the best mode now contemplated for carrying out the same; but the invention is not to be considered as limited to all details of the examples. Temperatures are in C. EXAMPLE 1 A clean, dry l-gallon glass-lined autoclave, previously purged with dry nitrogen was charged with 10.4 g. cobalt bis-(acetylacetonate) dihydrate, one liter of dry benzene, and 50 g. butadiene to form a complex with the cobalt compound. After 2 hours 12 g. triethylaluminum in 100 ml. benzene was added, followed by an additional 50 g. of butadiene. The reaction mixture was stirred at 25 for 16 hours. At this stage the product was amorphous and rubbery and contained both vinyl double bonds and internal double bonds as shown by infrared spectra. A solution of 11.5 g. diethyl fumarate in 100 ml. benzene was added and then 750 g. butadiene was introduced over a period of 0.5 hour while the temperature was maintained at 25 by external cooling. After 6 hours the autoclave was vented and the contents treated with 2 liters isopropyl alcohol containing 25 ml. conc. hydrochloric acid. The coagulated polymer was filtered, washed in a blender with methanol containing 0.5% by weight of commercial hindered polyphenol stabilizer, then collected and air dried. The yield was about 80% of free flowing white powder of rather indefinite fusion point in the range between 55 C. and 80 C. The vinyl double bond content is about 70%80% of the total double bond content. EXAMPLE 2 In a sigma blade mixer was dry blended 19 parts of the polybutadiene composition of Example 1, 1 part of diallyl phthalate prepolymer (Dapon 35 from FMC Corporation), 0.04 part of vinyl silane (coupling agent for glass), 1 part of di-alpha-cumyl peroxide, 1 part of zinc stearate and 80 parts of hydrophobic electrical grade calcium carbonate powder, all particles below 8 microns diameter. The blending was carried out for minutes to insure adequate mixing. No heat was applied. The charge was transferred to a roll mill operating at about 55 80 C. The charge quickly banded on the mill. Mixing was conducted for only 1 minutes, after which time the composition was sheeted off and allowed to cool. The non-tacky sheet could be broken into granules which do not sinter at room temperature. Two pieces pressed together between the fingers will not stick. The resulting granular molding composition was molded by a transfer molding technique, as follows: A preform was made by compressing the material and was placed in the heated chamber of the transfer molding apparatus. Then the chamber was closed and pressure was applied by a plunger to drive the fused composition from the chamber into a heated spiral mold, heated to temperature to cure the composition. The length to which the spiral is filled during the standard time of the molding cycle, e.g. 2 minutes, is a measure of flowability of the composition. This molding composition was also compression molded; and the deflection under standard loading, and hardness of the test bar obtained, were determined. Lower figures for deflection and higher figures for hardness correspond to higher degrees of cure. The table below sets out the data thus obtained upon (1) the molding composition using the polybutadiene composition of Example 1; and (2) a comparison molding composition, subjected to the same procedures (except for blending temperatures), and differing only in that syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene homopolymer was used therein instead of the Example 1 composition. The front roll temperature required for preparing the comparison molding composition was about 120 C., and to get a satisfactory blend required repeatedly removing the sheeted out composition and passing it endwise in rolled up form again through the mill to form a sheet again. TABLE (1) Molding compound of the invention: Heat distortion temperature (ASTM Test D-648)about Flowability (cure at 149 C.)-16 inches Deflection (cure at 149 C., 4 mins.)100 mm. Hardness by Barcol Test (cure at 167 C., 4 mins.)66 (2) Comparison molding composition: Heat distortion temperatureabout 260 C. Flowability1 inch Deflection-5 6 mm. Hardness70 The above data show that a molding compound based on the composition of the invention can readily be formulated at temperatures attainable with hot water or low pressure steam; and the resulting molding compound cures rapidly, similarly to 1,2-polybutadiene homopolymer. (The diflcrences are attributable to the rubbery character of the co-ingredient rather than to slower curing.) Moreover the molding compound of the invention has very good flowability, which is not found in the comparison molding compound. A preferred process for obtaining the compositions of this invention has been described above. As an alternative to using a complex catalyst of cobalt compound with butadiene, a cobalt complex with a butadiene open chain dimer can be used; and as an alternative to the organo aluminum compound catalyst ingredient, an organo zinc or organo lithium compound can be used. When using these alternatives under conditions otherwise in the same ranges as above, set out, similar results to the above are obtained. The invention claimed is: 1. In a process of polymerizing butadiene, the improvement for combining the major proportion of the butadiene in 1,2 form and obtaining a composition of fusion range between about 50 C. and about C., which comprises utilizing as initial catalyst a complex of a cobalt compound with butadiene or an open chain butadiene dimer, and with an organo metallic compound of zinc, lithium or aluminum and polymerizing butadiene to amorphous, rubbery polybutadiene having vinyl double bonds and internal double bonds; and thereafter adding as catalyst modifier a fumaric acid ester or maleic acid ester and continuing polymerization of butadiene to obtain principally 1,2-polybutadiene. 2. Process of claim 1 wherein said catalyst modifier is a dialkyl fumarate having C -C alkyl groups. 3. A polybutadiene composition having melting point within the range between about 50 C. and about 100 C. wherein the major constituent is a butadiene polymer having the major proportion of the butadiene content combined in the 1,2 form; and the essential co-ingredient is an amorphous, rubbery polymer of butadiene having vinyl double bonds and internal double bonds which is obtained by initially polymerizing butadiene to amorphous, rubbery polybutadiene having vinyl double bonds and internal double bonds utilizing as initial catalyst a complex of a cobalt compound with butadiene or an open chain butadiene dimer, and with an organo metallic compound of zinc, lithium or aluminum; and thereafter adding as catalyst modifier a fumaric acid ester or maleic acid ester and polymerizing butadiene to obtain principally 1,2-polybutadiene. 4. Composition of claim 3 wherein at least 65% of the double bonds of the composition are vinyl double bonds. 5. In a molding composition comprising a hydrocarbon polymer with high content of vinyl groups and a curing agent for said polymer, the improvement which comprises employing as said polymer the polybutadiene composition of claim 4.

        "text": "Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene (SPBD) is a thermoplastic polymer which can be utilized in a wide variety of applications. For example, the incorporation of SPBD into rubber compositions which are utilized in the supporting carcass or innerliner of tires greatly improves the green strength of those compositions. Electron beam precure (microwave precure) is a technique which has gained wide commercial acceptance as a means of improving the green strength of synthetic elastomers which are used in building tires. However, electron beam precure techniques are costly. The incorporation of SPBD into blends of such synthetic elastomers can often improve green strength to the degree that electron beam precure is not required. The incorporation of SPBD into halogenated butyl rubbers which are utilized as the innerliner compositions for tires also greatly improves the scorch safety of such compositions. U.S. Pat. No. 4,274,462 disclosed that pneumatic tires having improved resistance against heat build-up can be prepared by utilizing SPBD fibers in their tread base rubber. SPBD can also be molded into a wide variety of useful articles. Techniques for preparing SPBD by solution polymerization and by suspension polymerization are known in the art. A process is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,778,424 for the preparation of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene which comprises polymerizing 1,3-butadiene in an organic solvent in the presence of a catalyst composition composed of: (a) a cobalt compound, (b) an organoaluminum compound of the formula AlR3, in which R is a hydrocarbon radical of 1-6 carbons, and (c) carbon disulfide. U.S. Pat. No. 3,901,868 reveals a process for producing a butadiene polymer consisting essentially of syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene by the successive steps of: (a) preparing a catalyst component solution by dissolving, in an inert organic solvent containing 1,3-butadiene, a cobalt compound, soluble in the organic solvent, such as (i) cobalt-Î²-diketone complex, (ii) cobalt-Î²-keto acid ester complex, (iii) cobalt salt of organic carboxylic acid, and (iv) halogenated cobalt-ligand compound complex, and an organoaluminum compound, (b) preparing a catalyst composition by mixing the catalyst component solution with an alcohol, ketone or aldehyde compound and carbon disulfide, (c) providing a polymerization mixture containing desired amounts of 1,3-butadiene, the catalyst composition and an inert organic solvent, and (d) polymerizing 1,3-butadiene at a temperature of -20Â° C. to 90Â° C. U.S. Pat. No. 4,429,085 discloses a process for producing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene by suspension polymerization in an aqueous medium. In this aqueous polymerization process polybutadiene which has an essentially syndiotactic 1,2-microstructure is made by the steps of: (A) preparing a catalyst component solution by dissolving, in an inert organic solvent containing 1,3-butadiene (a) at least one cobalt compound selected from the group consisting of (i) Î²-diketone complexes of cobalt, (ii) Î²-keto acid ester complexes of cobalt, (iii) cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids having 6 to 15 carbon atoms, and (iv) complexes of halogenated cobalt compounds of the formula CoXn, wherein X represents a halogen atom and n represents 2 or 3, with an organic compound selected from the group consisting of tertiary amine alcohols, tertiary phosphines, ketones, and N,N-dialkylamides, and (b) at least one organoaluminum compound of the formula AlR3, wherein R represents a hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms; (B) preparing a reaction mixture by mixing said catalyst component solution with a 1,3-butadiene/water mixture containing desired amounts of said 1,3-butadiene; (C) preparing a polymerization mixture by mixing carbon disulfide throughout said reaction mixture, and (D) polymerizing said 1,3-butadiene in said polymerization mixture into polybutadiene while agitating said polymerization mixture. U.S. Pat. No. 4,751,275 discloses a process for the preparation of SPBD by the solution polymerization of 1,3-butadiene in a hydrocarbon polymerization medium, such as benzene, toluene, cyclohexane, or n-hexane. The catalyst system used in this solution polymerization contains a chromium-III compound which is soluble in hydrocarbons, a trialkylaluminum compound, and a dialkylphosphite, such as di-neopentylphosphite or di-butylphosphite. Heretofore, blends of SPBD with rubbery elastomers have been prepared utilizing standard mixing techniques. For instance, SPBD can be mixed throughout a rubbery elastomer utilizing a Banbury mixer or a mill mixer. However, these standard mixing procedures have certain drawbacks. These drawbacks include high processing costs, polymer degradation, inadequate mixing, and process limitations. The processing equipment required in order to mix SPBD throughout rubbery elastomers by mastication is also expensive and very costly to operate. Such standard mixing procedures result in polymer degradation due to the high shearing forces and high temperatures which may be required for mixing. For instance, it is generally desirable to mix the SPBD throughout the rubbery elastomer at a temperature which is above the melting point of the SPBD. Accordingly, SPBD powder, which is utilized in tire innerliner or carcass compounds, is mixed into the compound utilizing standard mixing procedures at a temperature which is at least as high as the melting point of the SPBD being used. Since high mixing temperatures result in degradation of the rubbery elastomer being utilized as the innerliner or carcass compound, the melting point of the SPBD utilized has typically been limited to no more than about 190Â° C. In order to limit polymer degradation, the SPBD utilized in such applications typically has a melting point of no more than about 160Â° C. Even though the green strength of tire carcass compounds containing SPBD increases with the melting temperature of the SPBD, the higher mixing temperature associated with the higher melting SPBD makes its utilization very difficult because of the degradation that occurs utilizing standard mixing techniques. Furthermore, good dispersions of SPBD throughout rubbers are difficult to attain utilizing conventional mixing techniques.

The subject invention further discloses a catalyst emulsion composition which is useful in the emulsion polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer into syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene, which is prepared by dissolving in an inert organic solvent containing at least one polyene (a) at least one cobalt compound selected from the group consisting of (i) Î²-ketone complexes of cobalt, (ii) Î²-keto acid ester complexes of cobalt, (iii) cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids having 6 to 15 carbon atoms, and (iv) complexes of halogenated cobalt compounds of the formula CoXn, wherein X represents a halogen atom and n represents 2 or 3, with an organic compound selected from the group consisting of tertiary amine alcohols, tertiary phosphines, ketones and N,N-dialkylamides, and (b) at least one organoaluminum compound of the formula AlR3 wherein R represents a hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms to produce a catalyst component solution, and microfluidizing the catalyst component solution with an oil, a surfactant, and water to an average particle size which is within the range of about 10 nanometers to about 1000 nanometers. The latices made by the process of this invention can be utilized in preparing blends of SPBD with rubbery elastomers. This can be done by simply mixing the SPBD latex with the latex of a rubber. For instance, an SPBD/styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) blend can be prepared by simply mixing the SPBD latex with an SBR latex. The SPBD/SBR blend can then be recovered utilizing conventional coagulation techniques. By utilizing this technique, all of the drawbacks associated with conventional blending of dry SPBD with dry rubbers are overcome. Blends of SPBD with various rubbery elastomers can also be prepared by utilizing the SPBD latex as the polymerization medium for preparing other emulsion rubbers. For instance, a blend of SPBD with SBR can be prepared by adding styrene monomer, 1,3-butadiene monomer, emulsifiers, and an appropriate initiator to a SPBD latex. The SBR is accordingly prepared by emulsion polymerization in the SPBD latex. This results in the formation of a latex which contains both SPBD and SBR. The SPBD/SBR blend can be recovered by simply coagulating the latex. The SPBD latices made in accordance with this invention are also valuable for utilization in other applications. For instance, SPBD powders having a very small particle size can be prepared by simply drying the SPBD latex. SPBD made utilizing other polymerization techniques must be ground in order to obtain small particle size powders. The SPBD latices of this invention can also be applied to substrates and allowed to dry. This provides the substrate with a thin coating of the SPBD. For instance, rubber slabs can be dipped in SPBD latex to prevent them from sticking together. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A catalyst emulsion composition is utilized to catalyze the emulsion polymerizations of this invention. A catalyst component solution is utilized in preparing such catalyst emulsion compositions. The catalyst component solution is prepared by dissolving at least one cobalt compound and at least one organoaluminum compound in an inert organic solvent containing at least one polyene monomer which is dissolved therein. The term \"an inert organic solvent\" used herein refers to an organic solvent chemically inert to all of the catalyst components, the emulsifier, the 1,3-butadiene and the SPBD. Some representative examples of inert organic solvents include aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, alicyclic hydrocarbons, halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, and mixtures of two or more of the above-mentioned compounds. Some representative examples of aromatic hydrocarbons that can be utilized include benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, diethylbenzene or isobutylbenzene. The aliphatic hydrocarbons which can be used include n-hexane, isohexanes, n-heptane, n-octane, isooctanes, n-decane, 2,2-dimethylbutane, petroleum ether, kerosene, petroleum spirit or petroleum naphtha. The alicyclic hydrocarbons that can be used include cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane. Some representative examples of halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons that can be used include chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzenes or trichlorobenzenes. The cobalt compound usable for the process of the present invention is soluble in an inert organic solvent selected from the group consisting of (i) Î²-diketone compounds; (ii) Î²-keto acid ester complexes of cobalt; (iii) cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids having 1 to 25 carbon atoms, and (iv) complexes of halogenated cobalt compounds of the formula CoXn wherein X represents a halogen atom and n represents 2 or 3, with an organic compound selected from the group consisting of tertiary amines, alcohols, tertiary phosphines, ketones and N,N-dialkylamides. The Î²-diketone compound which can be used to form a complex with a cobalt atom is of the formula: ##STR1## wherein R1 and R4, which are the same as or different from one another, are an alkyl radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms and R2 and R3, which are the same as or different from one another, are a hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. This type of Î²-diketone complex of cobalt may be cobalt (II) acetylacetonate or cobalt (III) acetylacetonate. The Î²-keto acid ester which can be used to form a complex with a cobalt atom may be of the formula: ##STR2## wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 are the same as defined above. This type of cobalt complex may be a cobalt-acetoacetic acid ethyl ester complex. Some representative examples of cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids that can be used include cobalt octoate and cobalt naphthanate. In the ligand compounds capable of forming a complex with a halogenated cobalt compound, the tertiary amine may be pyridine, triethylamine, tributylamine or dimethylaniline, the alcohol may be ethyl alcohol methyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, or n-butyl alcohol, the tertiary phosphine may be trimethyl phosphine, tributyl phosphine or triphenyl phosphine, the ketone may be acetone or methyl ethyl ketone and the N,N-dialkylamide may be N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-diethylformamide or N,N-diethylacetamide. The complex of halogenated cobalt is preferably either a complex of cobalt chloride with pyridine or ethyl alcohol. The organoaluminum compound usable for the process of the present invention is of the formula AlR3 wherein R represents a hydrocarbon radical containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The hydrocarbon radical may be an alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl radical containing from about 1 to about 6 carbon atoms. Preferably, the organoaluminum compound will be trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum triisobutylaluminum or triphenylaluminum. In the preparation of the catalyst component solution, it is important that the cobalt compound and the organoaluminum compound are dissolved in the inert organic solvent containing at least one polyene. Some polyenes that can be used in the formation of the polyene products used to prepare microencapsulated catalysts are 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, isoprene, myrcene and 1,5-cyclooctadiene. Polyenes in which at least two of the double bonds are conjugated and which have minimal substitution on the double bonds are preferred, particularly 1,3-butadiene. Other olefins which can be used are those which are capable of serving as chelating agents for transition metals, such as 1,5-cyclooctadiene. Polyenes with neither conjugation nor good chelating potential are much less effective. If the preparation is carried out in the absence of a polyene, the resultant catalyst component solution is not effective as a component of the catalyst composition of the present invention. The polyene is preferably used in a ratio by mole of at least 1.0, more preferably, at least 5.0 to the amount by mole of the cobalt compound to be used in the catalyst component solution. The preferred polyenes for use in this invention are 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, isoprene, and myrcene. The most preferred polyene is 1,3-butadiene. Generally, the larger the ratio of the amount of polyene to the cobalt compound in the catalyst component solution, the higher the activity of the catalyst. However, the activity of the catalyst reaches a maximum value at a ratio by mole of polyene monomer to the cobalt compound used in the catalyst component solution of between 10 and 200. For example, if a molar ratio of polyene monomer to the cobalt compound of 10,000 is employed, the activity of the catalyst will be similar to that of the catalyst prepared from a catalyst component solution containing a ratio of polyene monomer to the cobalt compound of from 10 to 200. If the ratio is less than 1.0, the resultant catalyst composition has poor activity. The catalyst component solution is preferably prepared at a temperature of -10Â° C. to 50Â° C. and preferably contains 0.0005 to 1.0% by mole, more preferably 0.001 to 0.5% by mole, of the cobalt compound. The temperature at which the catalyst component solution is prepared will more preferably be within the range of 5Â° C. to 25Â° C. and it is also highly desirable to use vigorous agitation in the preparation of the catalyst component solution. Generally, from about 0.001 to 10 mole percent, more preferably from about 0.03 to about 5 mole percent of the organoaluminum compounds is utilized, based on the amount of 1,3-utadiene to be polymerized. The ratio by mole of the organoaluminum compound to the cobalt compound is preferably in a range from 0.2 to 50, more preferably, within the range of from 0.5 to 10. In the preparation of the catalyst component solution, it is preferred for the cobalt compound to be first dissolved in the inert organic solvent in the presence of the polyene monomer and then for the organoaluminum compound to be added to the solution. However, very satisfactory results can also be obtained when the organoaluminum compound is added first. In the preparation of this catalyst component solution, the organoaluminum compound should not be allowed to come in contact with water. This is because water can completely decompose such organoaluminum compounds. Accordingly, it is preferable that the inert organic solvent to be used to prepare the catalyst component solution be preliminarily dehydrated at least up to a content of water which is insufficient to completely decompose the entire amount of the organoaluminum compound. It is preferable that the catalyst component solution be prepared using a dry (essentially water free) inert organic solvent. However, a trace of water in the inert organic solvent can be present up to a concentration of about 500 ppm (parts per million by weight). In fact, it is believed that the total elimination of water from such a catalyst component solution is undesirable. It is preferred for no more than 200 ppm of water to be present in the inert organic solvent used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution. If the content of water in the inert organic solvent is larger than 500 ppm, the catalyst component solution has to contain a relatively large amount of the cobalt compound and organoaluminum compound. This results in an economic disadvantage. If a sufficient amount of water is present in the inert organic solvent used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution, the catalyst can be completely destroyed. The catalyst component solution will preferably be stored under an inert gas atmosphere, such as nitrogen, in the absence of sunlight or ultraviolet light. It is desirable to allow the prereaction used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution to run for a period of at least 30 seconds, and more preferably for at least 1 minute before mixing the catalyst component solution with the oil, surfactant, and water used in making the catalyst emulsion composition. Longer time periods can be used without the catalyst component solution losing its activity. After the organoaluminum compound has been incorporated in the catalyst component solution using the above-described technique, the catalyst is \"protected\" from decomposition by water. This is believed to be due to a microencapsulation of the catalyst by polyene product formed in the prereaction process used in the preparation of the catalyst component solution. It is believed that a hydrophobic shield is formed around the catalyst that water cannot readily penetrate: however, this hydrophobic shield or membrane is probably permeable by the butadiene monomer being polymerized into the syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene. When 1,3-butadiene is used as the polyene, the butadiene product which microencapsulates the catalyst is believed to be a butadiene monomer complex, an oligomerized butadiene or a polymer of butadiene. It has been determined that this protection is sufficient to allow for the use of this catalyst component solution in the aqueous emulsion polymerization of butadiene into SPBD. The catalyst emulsion composition is prepared by microfluidizing or microemulsifying the catalyst component solution with an oil, a surfactant and water. In preparing the catalyst emulsion composition, it is highly desirable to first mix the catalyst component solution with the oil and to separately mix the surfactant with the water. The catalyst component solution/oil mixture is then subsequently mixed with the surfactant/water mixture immediately prior to the microfluidization. The ratio of oil to catalyst component solution will normally be within the range of about 0.5 to 30. It is normally preferred for the ratio of oil to catalyst component solution to be within the range of about 1 to about 10 and it is typically most preferred for the oil to catalyst component solution ratio to be within the range of about 2 to about 3. For example, a weight ratio of oil to catalyst component solution of about 2.5:1 is highly preferred. The weight ratio of water to catalyst component solution utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition is typically within the range of about 5 to about 80. It is normally preferred for the weight ratio of water to catalyst component solution to be within the range of about 10 to about 50. In most cases it will be more preferred for the weight ratio of water to catalyst component solution utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition to be within the range of about 20 to about 30. For instance, a weight ratio of water to catalyst component solution of about 27:1 is highly preferred for utilization in preparing the catalyst emulsion compositions of this invention. The weight ratio of surfactant to catalyst component solution utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition will typically be within the range of about 0.001 to about 10. In most cases it will be preferred to utilize a weight ratio of surfactant to catalyst component solution which is within the range of about 0.05 to 5. It is typically more preferred to utilize a ratio of surfactant to catalyst component solution which is within the range of about 0.1 to 0.3. Accordingly, a weight ratio of surfactant to catalyst component solution of about 0.2:1 is highly preferred. The oil utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition will typically be a long chain paraffinic oil. Such oils will generally be mixtures of various long chain hydrocarbons which contain from about 12 to about 28 carbon atoms. It is generally preferred for these compounds to be saturated. The oil will preferably be comprised of hydrocarbon compounds which contain from about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms. It is possible to utilize long chain alcohols which contain from about 12 to about 28 carbon atoms as the oil. The utilization of such alcohols results in the SPBD being synthesized having a lower melting point. It is, accordingly, desirable to use such alcohols as the oil if SPBD having a low melting point is desired. On the other hand, if SPBD having a high melting point is sought, then it will not be desirable to utilize alcohols as the oil. It is, of course, also possible to utilize a combination of paraffinic oils and alcohols to adjust the melting point of the SPBD as desired. The surfactant utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition will normally be an anionic surfactant or a nonionic surfactant. Some representative examples of types of anionic surfactants which can be utilized include carboxylates, alkylbenzene sulfonates, alkane sulfonates, Î±-olefin sulfonates, fatty alcohol sulfates, and oxo-alcohol sulfates. Some representative examples of types of nonionic surfactants which can be utilized include alkylphenol ethoxylates, fatty-alcohol polyethyleneglycol ethers, oxo-alcohol polyethyleneglycol ethers, ethylene oxide polymers, propylene oxide polymers, and fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers. It is generally preferred for the surfactant to be an anionic surfactant with alkyl benzene sulfonates, fatty alcohol sulfates, and oxo-alcohol ether sulfates being most preferred. The alkyl benzene sulfonates which are utilized generally have the structural formula: ##STR3## wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 8 to 18 carbon atoms and preferably wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 10 to 13 carbon atoms. The fatty alcohol sulfates which can be utilized normally have the structural formula: R--O--SO3 Na wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 6 to 28 carbon atoms and preferably wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 11 to 17 carbon atoms. The oxo-alcohol ether sulfates which can be utilized generally have the structural formula: ##STR4## wherein n is an integer from 1 to about 4 and wherein R and R' represent alkyl groups which can be the same or different with the total number of carbon atoms in R and R' ranging from about 11 to about 13. The microfluidization procedure utilized results in the formation of a catalyst emulsion composition which has an average particle size which is within the range of about 10 to about 1,000 nanometers. The catalyst emulsion composition prepared will preferably have an average particle size which is within the range of about 30 to about 600 nanometers and will more preferably have an average particle size which is within the range of about 60 to about 300 nanometers. This microfluidization procedure can be carried out utilizing conventional microfluidizers or other equipment which is capable of homogenizing the catalyst emulsion composition to the desired particle size. For instance, the microfluidization can be carried out utilizing a high pressure pump or series of pumps. Ultrasonic and/or mechanical means can be utilized in the microfluidization procedure. To attain the desired particle size, it may be advantageous to pass the catalyst emulsion composition which is being prepared through the Microfluidizer\u0099 more than one time. The catalyst component solution utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition is stable over long periods of time and can be stored for long periods without losing its activity. However, it is highly desirable to utilize the catalyst emulsion composition as soon as possible after it is prepared because the catalyst emulsion composition loses its activity over time. In practice, the catalyst emulsion composition loses essentially all of its activity after about 24 hours of being stored at room temperature. It is, accordingly, important to use the catalyst emulsion composition as soon as possible after its preparation. The aqueous reaction mixture is prepared by mixing (1) water, (2) at least one emulsifier, (3) 1,3-butadiene monomer, (4) the catalyst emulsion composition and (5) carbon disulfide and/or phenylthiocyanate. Water is the major component in the aqueous reaction mixture. The amount of 1,3-butadiene monomer in the aqueous reaction mixture will vary from about 2 weight percent to about 50 weight percent. However, in most cases it will be preferred for the aqueous reaction mixture to contain from about 10 weight percent to about 40 weight percent 1,3-butadiene monomer. It will generally be more preferred for the aqueous reaction mixture to contain from about 20 to about 30 weight percent 1,3-butadiene monomer. The amount of emulsifier utilized in preparing the aqueous reaction mixture will normally be within the range of about 0.1 phm to about 10 phm (parts per hundred parts of monomer). It will normally be preferred for the emulsifier to be present in an amount ranging from about 0.5 phm to about 5 phm. In most cases, it will be more preferred for the emulsifier to be present in an amount within the range of about 1 phm to about 3 phm. The emulsifiers used in the emulsion polymerization of 1,3-butadiene into SPBD may be charged at the outset of the polymerization or may be added incrementally or by proportioning as the reaction proceeds. Generally, anionic emulsifier systems provide good results, however, any of the general types of anionic, cationic or nonionic emulsifiers may be employed in the polymerization. Among the anionic emulsifiers that can be employed in such emulsion polymerizations are fatty acids and their alkali metal soaps such as caprylic acid, capric acid, pelargonic acid, lauric acid, undecyclic acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, and the like; amine soaps of fatty acids such as those formed from ammonia, mono- and dialkyl amines, substituted hydrazines, guanidine and various low molecular weight diamines; chain-substituted derivatives of fatty acids such as those having alkyl substituents: naphthenic acids and their soaps and the like: sulfuric esters and their salts, such as the tallow alcohol sulfates, coconut alcohol sulfates, fatty alcohol sulfates, such as oleyl sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate and the like; sterol sulfates: sulfates of alkylcyclohexanols, sulfation products of lower polymers of ethylene as C10 to C20 straight chain olefins, and other hydrocarbon mixtures, sulfuric esters of aliphatic and aromatic alcohols having intermediate linkages, such as ether, ester, or amide groups such as alkylbenzyl (polyethyleneoxy) alcohols, the sodium salt of tridecyl ether sulfate; alkane sulfonates, esters and salts, such as alkylchlorosulfonates with the general formula RSO2 Cl, wherein R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and alkylsulfonates with the general formula RSO2 --OH, wherein R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms; sulfonates with intermediate linkages such as ester and ester-linked sulfonates such as those having the formula RCOOC2 H4 SO3 H and ROOC--CH2 --SO3 H, wherein R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms such as dialkyl sulfosuccinates: ester salts with the general formula: ##STR5## wherein R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms; alkylaryl sulfonates in which the alkyl groups contain preferably from 10 to 20 carbon atoms, e.g. dodecylbenzenesulfonates, such as sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate; alkyl phenol sulfonates; sulfonic acids and their salts such as acids with the formula RSO3 Na, wherein R is an alkyl and the like; sulfonamides; sulfamido methylenesulfonic acids; rosin acids and their soaps; sulfonated derivatives of rosin and rosin oil; and lignin sulfonates, and the like. Carboxylate emulsifiers are highly preferred. This is because their utilization leads to less build-up on the walls of the polymerization reactor. Fatty acid soaps and rosin acid soaps are representative examples of highly preferred carboxylate soaps. Of rosin acids, about 90 percent are isometric with abietic acid and the other 10 percent is a mixture of dehydro abietic acid and dihydro abietic acid. Agitation should be provided in the preparation of the aqueous reaction mixture to ensure that the catalyst emulsion composition, the monomer, and the surfactant are distributed essentially homogeneously throughout the mixture. Since 1,3-butadiene monomer is very volatile, it will be necessary to prepare the aqueous reaction mixture under pressure in a closed system. The carbon disulfide or phenyl isothiocyanate is typically the last component to be added to the aqueous reaction mixture. The addition of carbon disulfide and/or phenyl isothiocyanate to the reaction mixture which already contains the catalyst emulsion composition will initiate the polymerization reaction. The amount of carbon disulfide or phenyl isothiocyanate that can be added will vary between 0.005 phm and 2 phm. More preferably, the amount of carbon disulfide added will vary between 0.001 and 1 phm. In the process of the present invention, the larger the proportion of the carbon disulfide in a range from about 0.0005 phm to about 0.5 phm in the polymerization mixture, the larger the yield of the SPBD obtained from the polymerization mixture. However, too large an amount of carbon disulfide, for example, larger than about 0.5 phm, causes a decrease in the polymer yield. In the process of the present invention, the crystallinity and melting point of the polybutadiene produced can be controlled by adding alcohols, ketones, nitriles, aldehydes, or amides to the aqueous reaction mixture. In this aqueous emulsion polymerization process, there is a limitation of controlling crystallinity and melting point with agents which are water-soluble. Thus, ethanol and methanol are not as effective as other alcohols which are much less soluble in water than in hydrocarbons. Water soluble agents cannot be used as effectively to control crystallinity and melting point (only hydrocarbon soluble agents can be used). A detailed description of the agents and techniques that are used to control crystallinity and melting points is given in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,901,868 and 4,153,767. These patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. As has been pointed out, water soluble agents, such as ethanol and methanol, are not effective agents. Other alcohols such as, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 1-decanol, and 5-tridecanol, which are not soluble in water, can be used with better success. The 1,3-butadiene monomer is polymerized into SPBD while agitating the polymerization mixture. If the use of an antioxidant is desired, it may be added conveniently at the beginning of the polymerization. This polymerization of 1,3-butadiene monomer can be carried out at a temperature from about -20Â° C. to about 100Â° C. It is preferable for the polymerization temperature to be from 0Â° C. to 60Â° C. The most preferred polymerization temperature is about 10Â° C. to about 30Â° C. At temperatures below 0Â° C., an antifreeze agent can be added to the polymerization mixture to keep it from freezing. This polymerization can be carried out either under a normal pressure or in a pressurized system. This polymerization can be carried out under an inert gas atmosphere, such as a nitrogen atmosphere, with good results. Such a polymerization can be run for a period of from about 3 to about 30 hours. It is generally preferred for the polymerization to be run for a period which is within the range of about 10 to 16 hours. However, the optimum polymerization time will vary greatly with the polymerization temperature, catalyst, the amount of catalyst used, etc. In most cases, the optimum polymerization time will be within the range of about 12 to about 14 hours. After the polymerization has been completed, the SPBD can be recovered from the latex by standard coagulation techniques. In the alternative, the SPBD latex can be blended with the latices of rubbery elastomers as desired or it can be utilized as the polymerization medium for preparing emulsion rubbers. In any case, the SPBD can be coagulated from the latex by utilizing standard techniques. For instance, coagulation can be accomplished by adding acids or blends of salts with acids to the latex. For example, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, blends of sodium chloride with sulfuric acid and blends of hydrochloric acid with methanol are very effective as coagulating agents. Calcium chloride solutions and blends of calcium chloride with various acids can also be utilized as coagulants. Salt/acid coagulants are generally preferred. For instance, the utilization of sulfuric acid with sodium chloride or potassium chloride as the coagulant will lead to good results. Barium chloride and magnesium sulfate are additional examples of divalent salts which are suitable for utilization in coagulating the SPBD latex. It may also be advantageous to employ materials classified as coagulation aids, such as high molecular weight polyelectrolytes, in the coagulation of the SPBD latex. The preferred coagulation aids are weak bases. Some representative examples of suitable coagulation aids which can be used include Nalco\u0099 108 (Nalco Chemical Company), Daxad\u0099 CP-1 (W. R. Grace and Company), and similar materials that are also weakly basic polyelectrolytes. The quantity of coagulant required will vary with the emulsifier, the amount of emulsifier used, the rubber being coagulated, and the type of coagulant being employed. Generally, the optimum type of coagulant, quantity of coagulant and coagulating conditions can be determined using a trial and error approach. If a blend of the SPBD with a rubbery elastomer is sought, then the SPBD latex is mixed with a latex of the rubbery elastomer prior to coagulation. The coagulation of such blended latices results in the formation of a highly dispersed blend of SPBD throughout the rubbery elastomer. The amount of SPBD and rubber in the blend is determined by the amount of the various latices which are mixed together. It is, of course, important for the latices to be compatible with each other to prevent undesired reactions from taking place. Blends of SPBD with a wide variety of rubbery elastomers including high cis-1,4-polybutadiene, synthetic polyisoprene, SBR, isoprene-butadiene rubber, nitrile rubber, butyl rubbers, halogenated butyl rubbers, ethylene propylene diene monomer rubbers (EPDM), and ethylene propylene rubbers (EPR) can be made utilizing this technique. In cases where the SPBD latex is utilized as the polymerization medium for producing emulsion rubbers typically additional water, emulsifiers initiator, and desired monomers will be added thereto. It is, of course, important to select an emulsifier, initiator, and monomers which are compatible with the SPBD latex. The monomers present in the polymerization medium are then polymerized into the rubbery elastomer desired. For instance, this can be done utilizing free radical polymerization techniques. Such polymerizations can be initiated utilizing standard chemical free radical initiators, ultraviolet light, or radiation. To ensure a satisfactory polymerization rate, uniformity, and a controllable polymerization, free radical initiators are generally used with good results. Free radical initiators which are commonly used include the various peroxygen compounds such as potassium persulfate, ammonium persulfate, benzoyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, di-t-butyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl peroxide, decanoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, p-menthane hydroperoxide, t-butylhydroperoxide, acetyl acetone peroxide, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, succinic acid peroxide, dicetyl peroxydicarbonate, t-butyl peroxyacetate, t-butyl peroxymaleic acid, t-butyl peroxybenzoate, acetyl cyclohexyl sulfonyl peroxide and the like; the various azo compounds such as 2-t-butylazo-2-cyanopropane, dimethyl azodiisobutyrate, azodiisobutyronitrile, 2-t-butylazo-1-cyanocyclohexane, 1-t-amylazo-1-cyanocyclohexane, and the like: the various alkyl perketals, such as 2,2-bis-(t-butylperoxy)butane, ethyl 3,3-bis(t-butylperoxy) butyrate, 1,1-di-(t-butylperoxy) cyclohexane, and the like. Cumene hydroperoxide can be used as an initiator to obtain very good results in the polymerization of carboxylated nitrile rubber. The emulsion polymerization system used in the synthesis of carboxylated rubbers can be treated at the desired degree of conversion with shortstopping agents, such as hydroquinone. The latex made can then be coagulated using a standard technique. This results in the formation of a highly dispersed blend of the SPBD throughout the rubbery elastomer. In an alternative embodiment of this invention, SPBD latex can be prepared in the latex of a rubbery elastomer. Such polymerizations are carried out by adding 1,3-butadiene monomer, the catalyst emulsion composition, carbon disulfide and/or phenyl isothiocyanate, and additional emulsifiers if desired to the latex of the rubbery elastomer. A latex containing the SPBD as well as the rubbery elastomer will result. This latex can accordingly be coagulated to form a highly dispersed blend of the SPBD throughout the rubbery elastomer. This invention is illustrated by the following examples which are merely for the purpose of illustration and are not to be regarded as limiting the scope of the invention or the manner in which it can be practiced. Unless specifically indicated otherwise, parts and percentages are given by weight. Particle sizes reported herein were determined utilizing a Nicomp Model 370 dynamic light scattering unit using automatic sample preparation techniques. EXAMPLE 1 In this experiment a latex of SPBD was prepared. The first step of the procedure utilized involved making the catalyst component solution. This was done by charging 7.3 lbs. (3.3 kg) of hexane to a reactor which had been evacuated for 30 minutes. Then 0.61 lbs. (0.28 kg) of cobalt octoate was added with the mixture being agitated. Then 1.3 lbs. (0.59 kg) of 1,3-butadiene was added. After that 3.5 lbs. (1.59 kg) of triethylaluminum was added with the agitation being continued. Cooling was also utilized to keep the temperature of the mixture below about 70Â° F. (21Â° C.). After all of the triethylaluminum had been added and the temperature fell below 50Â° F. (10Â° C.). The catalyst component solution which had been prepared was transferred to a clean plastic 5 gallon (18.9 liter) carboy for storage in a cold room until needed. The catalyst component solution was additionally stored under a blanket of nitrogen in the absence of light. A mixture of the catalyst component solution with a paraffinic oil was then prepared. This was done by mixing 450 grams of the catalyst component solution with 300 grams of a paraffinic process oil. A surfactant solution was also prepared. This was done by mixing 7 lbs. (3.2 kg) of water with 300 grams of an aqueous solution containing 28% sodium lauryl sulfate. The mixture of the oil with the catalyst component solution was then microfluidized with the surfactant solution. This was done in a homogenizer unit made by Microfluidics Corporation. Mixing of the aqueous and organic phases was accomplished utilizing a mixing Tee just ahead of the Microfluidizer\u0099 pump. The homogenization process was continued until an average particle size for the catalyst emulsion composition of about 100 nanometers was attained. The catalyst emulsion composition prepared was determined to contain particles which varied in size from about 60 to about 300 nanometers. A buffer solution having a pH of about 9.5 was prepared by mixing 20 lbs. (9.1 kg) of water with 1.8 lbs. (0.82 kg) of a tallow fatty acid. The buffer solution was added to a polymerization reactor and 12.5 lbs. (5.7 kg) of 1,3-butadiene monomer was charged into the reactor. The reactor was equipped with two afts with baffles for agitation which was carried out at 150 rpm. The catalyst emulsion composition prepared was charged into the reactor along with 9 grams of carbon disulfide which was dissolved in 391 grams of hexane. The polymerization was carried out at a temperature of about 50Â° F. (10Â° C.) for a period of 12 to 14 hours. A stable SPBD latex having a solids content of above 20% was produced. EXAMPLE 2 In this experiment SPBD latex made by the procedure specified in Example 1 was utilized in the polymerization medium utilized in preparing emulsion SBR. This polymerization was carried out utilizing a 10 gallon (37.9 liter) reactor. The aqueous reaction mixture utilized was prepared by charging 8 lbs. (3.6 kg) of water, 50 lbs. (22.7 kg) of SPBD latex prepared by the procedure described in Example 1, 0.38 lbs. (170 grams) of a tallow fatty acid, 0.38 (170 grams) of a rosin acid, 0.11 lbs. (47.5 grams) of potassium sulfate, 0.04 lbs. (19.2 grams) of sodium naphthalene sulfonate (a dispersing agent), 0.005 lbs. (2.3 grams) of sodium hydrosulfide (an oxygen scavenger), 0.018 lbs. (7.9 grams) of sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate (a reducing agent), 5.63 lbs. (2.54 kg) of styrene, 0.063 lbs. (28.3 grams) of t-dodecylmercaptan (a chain regulator), 0.015 lbs. (6.8 grams) of p-methane hydroperoxide, 13.1 lbs. (5.9 kg) of 1,3-butadiene, and 0.4 grams of a chelated iron salt of tetraethyldiamine tetra-acetic acid which was dissolved in 1.25 lbs. (565 grams) of water. The polymerization was carried out at 50Â° F. (10Â° C.) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The polymerization was shortstopped when a solids content of about 23% was attained. The polymerization was shortstopped by charging a mixture containing 1 lbs. (452 grams) of water, 0.05 lbs. (22.6 grams) of sodium dithiocarbamate, and 0.05 lbs. (22.6 grams) of diethyl hydroxyl amine into the reactor. A stable latex containing SPBD and SBR was obtained utilizing this procedure. The latex was coagulated to produce a highly dispersed blend of SPBD with SBR. This experiment shows that SPBD latex can be utilized in the polymerization medium used in preparing emulsion SBR. This procedure provides a convenient means of preparing highly dispersed blends of SPBD in SBR. EXAMPLE 3 In this experiment a highly dispersed blend of SPBD in nitrile rubber was prepared. This was done by utilizing SPBD latex made by the procedure described in Example 1 as part of the polymerization medium. This polymerization was carried out in a 10 gallon (37.9 liter) laboratory polymerization reactor. The polymerization medium was prepared by charging 22.7 kg of SPBD latex made by the procedure described in Example 1, 3.6 kg of water, 282.5 grams of a tallow fatty acid, 33.9 grams of tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 7.9 grams of sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, 2.8 kg of acrylonitrile, 50.9 grams of t-dodecylmercaptan, 7.9 grams of p-methanehydroperoxide, 5.7 kg of 1,3-butadiene, and 0.4 grams of a chelated iron salt of tetraethylene diamine tetracetic acid which was dissolved in 565 grams of water. The polymerization was carried out at 50Â° F. (10Â° C.) under a nitrogen atmosphere with agitation being applied. When a solids content of about 28% was attained, the polymerization was shortstopped by charging a solution containing 452 grams of water, 22.6 grams of sodium dithiocarbamate, and 22.6 grams of diethylhydroxyl amine into the reactor. A latex containing both SPBD and nitrile rubber was prepared in this experiment. It could be coagulated to obtain a highly dispersed blend of SPBD in nitrile rubber. The latex prepared utilizing this procedure was very stable. This experiment shows that SPBD latex can be utilized as a major component of the polymerization medium in which emulsion nitrile rubber is prepared. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 4 The procedure utilized in Example 1 was repeated in this experiment except that the paraffinic process oil was not utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition. In this experiment the polybutadiene produced did not contain a significant amount of syndiotactic 1,2-microstructure. In fact, the polybutadiene produced was a rubbery polymer. This experiment shows that it is necessary to utilize an oil in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition. If the oil is not utilized in preparing the catalyst emulsion composition, SPBD is not produced in polymerizations which are initiated utilizing the catalyst. While certain representative embodiments and details have been shown for the purpose of illustrating the subject invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in this art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the scope of this invention."

Cl. 260-5 6 Claims ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE The new compositions consisting of 50-95% by weight of natural rubber and 550% by weight of amorphous 1,2-polybutadiene may be subjected to vulcanization treatments, thus resulting in vulcanizates of improved mechanical properties and stability. This invention relates to new compositions containing amorphous 1,2-polybutadiene of high molecular weight. These compositions consist essentially of mixtures, in critical proportions, of natural rubber and amorphous 1,2- polybutadiene of high molecular weight. Although natural rubber is broadly used in industry, for example for manufacturing tires, damping rubber articles and such articles as driving belts, this material has inherent defects which it has not been possible, up to now, to obviate in an altogether satisfactory manner. Thus, natural rubber cannot be admixed easily with charges, such as carbon black. Moreover, when more than 45% by weight of carbon black is admixed with natural rubber, the mechanical characteristics of the latter substantially decrease, and the mixture cannot 'be processed easily. When subjected to vulcanization under conventional conditions, natural rubber gains good mechanical properties. However, when the vulcanization temperatures are increased in an attempt to speed up the output rates, the mechanical properties sharply decrease. Moreover, natural rubber has poor characteristics of resistance to ageing and remanence to compression, and it would be beneficial to improve the latter. Finally, the reversion ratio of vulcanizates obtained from natural rubber (i.e. the relative loss of mechanical properties resulting from multiplying, for example by four, the optimal vulcanization time) is rather high, and it would also be beneficial to reduce it. This invention has for an object new compositions which have, in the vulcanized state, a surprisingly reduced reversion ratio; moreover, they can be processed easily and retain good mechanical properties even when additional charges have been added thereto in as high amounts as 65% or even 80% with respect to their own weight. They also have a better behavior when vulcanized at a high temperature, and an improved resistance to ageing and remanence to compression as compared to natural rubber. These properties will be shown in the experiments described hereinafter. The compositions of this invention consist essentially of mixtures of natural rubber (1,4 cis polyisoprene) and amorphous 1,2-polybutadiene such as hereinafter defined, said mixtures having a natural rubber content by weight of 50 to 95%, and preferably 70 to 90%, and a 1,2-polybutadiene content by weight of 5 to 50%, and preferably 10 to 30%. Amorphous 1,2-polybutadiene which is used in the compositions of this invention, has a 1,2-units content of at least a crystallinity ratio at 20 C. lower than 2% and an average molecular weight of at least 50,000. These characteristics may be determined as follows: The 1,2-units content by infra-red spectrometry according to Ciampelli et al. in La Chemica e I'Industria 41, 1959, page 758. The average molecular weight by light difiusion, The crystallinity ratio at 20 C. by X-rays spectography, for example according to the method of the Belgian Pat. No. 549,554 of Jan. 14, 1957, or the French Pat. 1,154,938 (US. Pat. No. 2,905,646). These amorphous 1,2-polybutadienes are practically free of gel and are soluble in a number of common solvents, for example benzene, toluene, chloroform or carbon sulfide. They have been described, as well as their manufacture, for example in USP 3,451,987. It will be appreciated that the mixtures of natural rubber and amorphous 1,2-polybutadiene which contain more than 50%\" of amorphous 1,2-polybutadiene have poor mechanical properties, particularly a poor resistance to breaking. These compositions are not within the scope of this invention. The preferred compositions are those which have a satisfactory brittle point, for example a brittle point lower than -45 C. which is, as a rule, the highest value accepted by tire mnaufacturers. These preferred compositions have an amorphous 1,2-polybutadiene content lower than 30%. The minimal content by weight of amorphous 1,2-polybutadiene in the compositions of this invention is 5%, and preferably 10%. These new compositions may be obtained by any conventional technique for admixing elastomers. For example, the constituents may be admixed in a roll-mixer at any convenient temperature, for example 30 to 80 C. During this operation, conventional additives may be incorporated into the mixture, for example antioxidants, such as phenyl-B-naphlihylamine or tert. butyl para-cresol, various charges, such as carbon black, hydrocarbon oils, vulcanization agents, such as sulfur, vulcanization accelerators such as N-cyclohexyl-Z-benzothiazyl sulfenamide, or again zinc oxide or stearic acid. The resulting product may be vulcanized in a press under known conditions of temperature (about -180 C., preferably C.) and pressure (for example 1 to 100 bars, preferably about 70 bars). The following examples show the improved properties of the compositions of this invention, as compared to those of natural rubber alone. EXAMPLES Natural rubber has been admixed with 1,2-polybutadiene having a crystallinity ratio at 20 C. lower than 2%, an average molecular weight of 400,000 and a 1,2- units content of 91%. The following additives have been admixed with 100 g. of either natural rubber (crude gum) or mixtures containing the same: N-cyclohexyl-Z-benzothiazyl sulfenamide 0.6 The resulting mixtures have been subjected to the following treatments: Mechanical properties (ASTM D-412 corresponding to the French NF T 46,002 standard). Remanence to compression (ASTM D 395 corresponding to the French standard NF T 46,011). The test had been carried out on natural rubber and on a mixture of 25% amorphous 1,2-polybutadiene and 75% Table I shows that the vulcanization at high temperanatural rubber.
