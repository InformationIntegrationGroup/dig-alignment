Mn was selectively oxidized at the surface by annealing in Ar gas containing an impurity level of O2 (<0.01ppm). Resistivity of the film was decreased to 2.0 μΩcm after annealing. On the other hand, internal oxidation of Cu-Mn alloy was observed with no external protective surface oxide layer in Ar containing more than 10 ppm of O2. An optimum oxygen concentration is found to be in between 0.01 and 10 ppm in 1atm of Ar gas at 350 °C. \n (Received March 13 2008) \n (Accepted April 29 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t barrier layer;  \n\t

The technique does not depend on the type of material development \nmethod or special thin film processing. Moreover, additional structures or calibrations are not \nrequired. The proposed method can be used to determine the loss of a thin film material using radio \nfrequency capacitance measurements in both parallel plate and interdigital topologies. An analytical \nformulation is given for the computation of the film loss based on its measured input impedance \nwhich is extracted from the measured scattering parameters. This technique is used for barium \nstrontium titanate (BST) thin film material characterizations.  \n \nIntroduction \n   \n          The change of dielectric parameters under a DC electrical field (tunability) opens the way for a \nnumber of very interesting enabling technologies. One type of the materials that is gaining more and \nmore importance are thin film where there is a strong interaction between the dc applied field and the \nmaterials electrical properties that could be translated into innovative components and circuits \narchitectures. Among the different thin film materials that exist today, barium strontium titanate \n(BST) is employed due to its tunability at room temperature which finds great potential applications to \nassist microwave tunability. \n \n         Integrated barium strontium titanate voltage-controlled capacitors are core components in \ntunable RF and microwave devices such as voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs) [1,3], tunable filters \n[4,5], phase shifters [6,7], and tunable matching networks [8]-[9]. A varactor with high quality factor \nand large tuning range is a mandatory prerequisite to meet the requirements of high tunable \ncomponents specifications [10]. The quality of the BST thin film depends on its processing conditions \nsuch as temperature, thickness and substrate [11]. However, the development of BST growth \nconditions for optimizing its film losses demands a standard characterization method. The losses in \nBST thin films are due to: \n \n\u2022 Lattice oscillations of ions in the crystalline network. \n\u2022 BST growth conditions (oxygen vacancies, grain boundaries, extended defects). \n\u2022 Type of the deposition method (grain size and shape). \n\u2022 Thickness of the film. \n\u2022 The dielectric constant. \n \nWhereas the full stack losses in BST based components are due to: \n \n\u2022 BST film losses. \n\u2022 Substrate coated dielectrics losses. \n\u2022 Metallization loss. \n\u2022 Films defected interface. \n\u2022 The inherent crystallographic incompatibility of two materials. \n \nInterdigitated capacitor structures were achieved by lift-off process [12]. The structure has 16 fingers \nof width 3.5μm, length of 100μm and spacing of 3.5μm. The Ba0.6Sr0.4TiO3 thin films were deposited \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc.

The two interdigited capacitors have been activated by applying a DC bias \non the signal lines. The two capacitors are isolated from each other by more than 45 dB which is good \nenough to decouple them. Hence, any information about the device performance, material \ncharacterizations, and modeling are constructed from its reflection coefficients. \n \n \n  \nFigure 2: The |S11 | reflection coefficient and the circuit model \n \n \n \n Figure 2 shows the measured reflection coefficients of the device. The tunability is more pronounced \nat higher frequencies due to the value of the tuned capacitance which exhibits a low value. The BST \ntuning mechanism exhibits unavoidable losses at high frequency, thus limiting their based devices \nperformances as shown in Fig. 3. The limitation of device quality factor due to its ohmic losses can be \navoided by thicker metallization. The extracted BST film losses using (17) is shown in Fig. 4. As the \nfrequency increases the losses decrease. The 5 GHz resonance could result from computational errors. \nFigure 5 shows the losses around the range of interest. \n \n \n   \n  \n \n   \n 10� 20� 30� 40� 50�\n0,0�\n \n 0,2�\n \n 0,4�\n \n 0,6�\n \n 0,8�\n \n 1,0�\n \n 1,2�\n \n 1,4�\n \n  �\n \n D\niff\n \n er\nnt\n \n ia\nl l\n \n os\nse\n \n s \n[o\n \n hm\ns]\n \n �\n \n Frequency [GHz]�\n \n  \n \n Figure 3: Introduced losses by BST tuning mechanism \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n 10� 20� 30� 40� 50�\n-2,0k�\n \n 0,0�\n \n 2,0k�\n \n 4,0k�\n \n 6,0k�\n \n 8,0k�\n \n 10,0k�\n \n 12,0k�\n \n 14,0k�\n \n 16,0k�\n \n  �\n \n In\ntr\n \n in\nsi\n \n c \nlo\n \n ss\n [o\n \n hm\ns]\n \n �\n \n Frequency [GHz]�\n \n  \n \n Figure 4: BST film losses at zero bias \n  \n  \n \n   \n 1,00� 1,25� 1,50� 1,75� 2,00� 2,25� 2,50� 2,75� 3,00�\n100�\n \n 200�\n \n 300�\n \n 400�\n \n 500�\n \n 600�\n \n 700�\n \n 800�\n \n In\ntr\n \n in\nsi\n \n c \nlo\n \n ss\n [o\n \n hm\ns]\n \n �\n \n Frequency [GHz]�\n \n  \n \n Figure 5: Intrinsic losses around the interest frequency range \n \n \n  \n \n Conclusion \n \nSimple characterization method for tunable thin films is presented in this paper.

The use of NH3 resulted in a \nretardation of UV cure, explained by the higher absorption cross section of NH3 at the \nwavelengths used. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n \n UV curing of low-k films has received particular attention as a post deposition treatment \ndue to its ability to effectively improve film modulus [1] while removing porogen and retaining \nporosity, all with low thermal budget and little increase in k value [2].  In general increasing cure \ntime will result in increased modulus, eventually at the disadvantage of an increase in film k.  \nThis work will describe the use of oxygen addition to the cure process to achieve an accelerated \ncure process, enabling a targeted film modulus to be achieved with shorter cure time, with little \nor no impact on k value.   \n \nEXPERIMENT \n \n \n Three carbon doped SiOCH film types were used for this study.  The first was a porous \nSOG, prepared by a typical spin-on and soft bake process with target k=2.5.  The second was a \nPECVD non-porous film with target k=3.0.  The final film was a porous PECVD film formed by \nthe co deposition of a lattive and cyclic organic porogen material.  The removal of the porogen \nachieved the target k=2.5.   All films used were of nominal thickness ~ 10kA.  The cure process \nused the Axcelis RapidCure 320FC UV cure tool.  The process uses microwave driven \nelectrodless bulbs emitting UV radiation in the 100-400 nm range with the wafer temperature \nmaintained at 400oC with thermal chuck.  Standard process conditions used a constant purge of \nN2 gas at atmospheric pressure.  Oxygen additions to the ambient were set at 50 and 100 ppm in \nN2, while ammonia concentrations tested were 50, 100 and 750 ppm.  All tests were processed \nfor 3 mins, and compared to the cure process with N2 only ambient.  K values were determined \nusing Al shadow mask techniques. Mechanical properties were determined using an MTS \nnanoindentor XP.  Solid state Si29 MAS NMR was carried out on a Bruker Avance NMR \nspectrometer (11.7 Tesla, 500.2MHz, 4mm Zr O2 rotor @ 10kHz). \n \nDISCUSSION \nEffect of UV cure with N2 ambient \n \n \n Although cure of dielectric films is well documented, the effects of increasing cure time \nfor the films used in this work will first be summarized.  Figure (1) illustrates film shrinkage for \ncure times of 1, 3, 6 and 13 minutes for all three dielectrics studied.  The relative modulus and \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc.

In this work, the post\u0096pre subtracted spectra are used to allow the subtle changes in \nthe SiO network (~1050 cm-1) and SiO cage (~1050 cm-1) region to be measured, while the Si-\nCH3 (1273 cm\n \n -1)/SiO peak ratio loss follows Si-CH3 cleavage.

The maximum \nconcentration of oxygen usable without film damage will be a factor of film type, thickness, \npresence of porogen, temperature and UV source employed. The mechanism is proposed to be \ndue to the dissociation of oxygen, or ozone, under the UV wavelengths present as in equations \n(1) and (3) below.  The oxygen radical produced facilitates Si-CH3 cleavage, thereby \nencouraging greater Si-O networking.  Further support for this mechanism may be derived from \nthe increase of TOH (HOSiO3) species, formed by O\n \n \u0095 insertion into the H-SiO3 or cleavage of R-\nSiO3, potentially being the reason for the increase in k above. \n \n This mechanism is proposed to act on the SiOCH lattice, occurring most readily with the \nporous SOG 2.5 film.  The presence of the cyclic organic porogen in the CVD 2.5 is likely to \nhinder the catalytic effect of oxygen radical, resulting in the relatively lower shrinkage and SiO \nnetwork increases.  The insensitivity of this film to increasing oxygen concentrations may further \nsupport this. \n \n \n O2 + UV (180-240nm) � O\u0095 + O\u0095 (1)\n \n O3 + UV (200-320nm) � O\u0095 + O2 (3)\n \n O\u0095 + O2 + M O3 + M* (2)\n \n O3 + O\u0095� 2O2 (4) \n \nEffect of UV cure with additions of NH3 to the N2 ambient \n \n Controlled additions of ammonia at concentrations of 50, 100 and 750ppm in N2 were \nused in the UV cure of  SOG 2.5 and CVD 3.0 films.

While the presence of \nBTA allows a ten-fold reduction in the static etch rate from 95 nm/min. to 10 nm/min., combining \noxidizer and complexing agent leads to removal rates higher than 400 nm/min. Different surface \nmorphology and RMS roughness are observed after polishing with composite abrasives and different \nperoxide concentrations. Oxidizer concentrations as low as 0.1 vol.% lead to high non-uniformity and \ndefectivity values. In particular, composite B performs better than pure colloidal/fumed silica during \ncopper CMP using the IC-1000 pad, giving comparable Material Removal Rate (MRR), but a better \nsurface finish due to the contribution of the elasticity of the polymer in gently transferring the applied \nload to the wafer surface. Cu CMP with pure polymer particles is a promising alternative to the hard \ninorganic material especially if combined with suitable surfactants that act from both particle stabilization \nand friction reduction / lubrication improvement perspectives. \n \n The use of the medium/high-hardness pad IC-1000 is compared to the use of a soft Politex pad. In the \nformer case, differences in terms of MRR, MRS roughness, and total defects are observed between the \ncomposite abrasives A and B; in the latter case, the behaviour of the two composites is similar. In the case \nof a soft pad in combination with composite abrasives, there is a remarkable improvement in the \ndefectivity without any loss in MRR.  \n \n As revealed by SEM inspection of the composite particles collected in the slurry drain after CMP, for \nall the composites, the silica shell coverage is not disrupted by the shear forces and chemistry during the 1 \nmin. polishing. Consequently, the stability and agglomeration properties of the particles in the complex \nCu CMP chemistry can be helpful in explaining the experimental results in terms of MRR and surface \nfinishing.  \n \n  \nINTRODUCTION \n \n \n In the copper deposition sequence, there are three main areas where defects can be introduced and \nhave an impact on yield: i) during barrier/seed deposition; ii) during electrofill; and iii) during CMP. The \nmost important yield limiting defect types after copper CMP are scratches, voids and pitting since they \ncan create shorts in dense metal lines and long-term reliability failures. Choice of abrasive and chemistry \nin the slurry is considered as one of the main contributing root causes. A bad combination of abrasive and \nchemistry and hard foreign matters from the slurry or environment, are the root causes. Furthermore, Cu \nis known to easily corrode. A Cu film with very large grain size may be easier to corrode along the grain \nboundaries, where the grain size is dependent mainly on the annealing conditions. Corrosion activity is \nenhanced under high mechanical stress (stress-induced corrosion). Usually, a corrosion inhibitor is \nnecessary in the slurry. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate if the composite abrasives \nalready extensively evaluated through oxide CMP experiments [1], can constitute a useful alternative to \n \n Mater.

Vol. 1079 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1079-N11-04 \n  \n \n   \n replace the standard silica and alumina particles, in order to improve defectivity, without loosing their \nbeneficial properties, e.g. MRR and Non-Uniformity (NU). While the effect of the chemical component in \nthe CMP process has been studied extensively [2-5], the role of the mechanical component, that has a \nstrong impact on defect formation, remains unclear. Despite a high number of theoretical models \navailable in literature [6-13], based on different kinds of interaction between pad, particle and wafer, \nexperimental data is scarce. The sheer number of variables associated with the abrasives complicates our \nunderstanding of how particles contribute to the MRR, defectivity and surface finishing. Furthermore, \ndespite the volume of patent literature and commercial slurries available, due to the proprietary nature of \nmost CMP compositions, the information that can be gleaned from these sources relevant for the \ndevelopment of next-generation slurries is limited.  \n \n Our research focuses on entirely novel composite structures comprising polymer particles coated by \nsmaller silica colloids, achieved by either creating chemical bonds by silane-coupling agents (composite \nA) or tuning the pH in order to form electrostatic attractive interactions between the core and the shell \n(composite B). In this way, it is possible to combine several advantageous properties in the same \nstructure. The polymer core shows mechanical properties that are highly tunable by variation of its \nsynthesis parameters [14, 15], while the major advantage of the silica coating is that it can be easily \nmodified, in terms of its surface chemistry and morphology.  \n \n In particular, our composite particles are aimed at improving the CMP process of easily damaged \nmaterials such as copper, due to the spring-like effect coming from the elastic properties of the core, \nwhich allows the composites to easily adapt to the pad asperities. \n \n The main advantage of our bottom-up approach to particle synthesis is the predetermined control of \nthe chemical composition of the system and physical properties of the individual components. Post-\nsynthesis characterization of our particles includes bulk properties, such as the elastic compressive \nmodulus [16], size, morphology, and surface properties, such as surface charge, functional groups. In \nparticular, the ζ potential of the particles vs. changes in ionic strength and pH gives essential information \non the stability and agglomeration behaviour of the particles in the polishing solution, which is expected \nto correlate closely with scratch formation during CMP [17].  \n \n  \nEXPERIMENT \n \nMaterials and set-ups. For all the copper CMP experiments, 200 mm copper wafers were obtained by \ndepositing a 25 nm Ta (15 nm)/TaN (10 nm) diffusion barrier, and a 100 nm Cu seed layer deposited in a \nphysical vapor deposition (PVD) chamber (ElectraTM, AMAT) on a standard dielectric stack (500 nm \nSiO2 on 50 nm Si3N4). 1 µm Cu film is deposited by electrochemical deposition (Electra-ECP-Cu, \nAMAT) using Shipley Nanoplate plating bath chemistry. To allow post-CMP characterization in Cu-\nshared tools, some of the wafers received a backside 50 nm nitride layer. The polishing tool was a rotary \npolisher (E 460 Mecapol polisher, Alpsitec). The details of the materials used are summarized in Table 1. \nThe particles used as abrasives in the slurry are presented in Table 2. For the preparation of the slurry, a \nmechanical shaker was applied for 10 min. before the CMP experiments. During the polishing, the slurry \nwas stirred by a magnetic bar at a speed of 400 rpm. \n \n  \nTable 1.

After CMP the copper wafers were kept wet in a DI water tank in order \nto avoid that the particles and polishing residues irreversibly stick to the wafer surface. After a constant \nwaiting time of longer than 1 h, to avoid serious corrosion of the copper surface, the wafers were \nprocessed in the cleaning station of the AMAT Mirra-Mesa polisher through the wet que. The wafers \nfrom the input station passed through the Megasonic cleaning station, two brush stations, the spin-rinse \ndry (SRD) station, and finally they reached the output station. The recipe used was Marathon and only DI \nwater was used for the rinsing.  \n \n  \nDefectivity and surface morphology investigation. The defectivity on non-patterned full copper wafers \nwas determined by a light scattering method. For the experiments made in the first part of this work with \na Politex pad, silica, polymer and composite particles, the SP1DLS tool was used and a recipe was \nspecifically optimized for copper wafers after polishing (IP: s; CP_W: s; CP_N:s; Aperture: 20 degree, \ncalibrated). This recipe allowed a minimum defect size of 254 nm. For the defectivity measurements after \ncopper CMP with the harder pad IC 1000 and a range of chemistry/abrasives we used the Surfscan 6400 \nbut, since the number of defects in this case was much higher leading to the overload of the detector, we \nhad to lower the minimum defect size threshold to 700 nm. This should be constantly considered when \ncomparing the defectivity data. \n \n To investigate the surface morphology we used the AFM technique. WSxM software [18] assisted the \nextraction of cross-sectional data and facilitated 3D elaboration of the images. \n \n  \nCopper layer Rs measurement. Sheet Resistance (Rs) measurements on copper unpatterned wafers were \nperformed using the Prometrix OmniMap RS75 four probe system (conditions: 49 points measured \u0096 10 \nmm edge exclusion). The Rs of a layer with resisitivity ρ, and thickness t, is given by their ratio: Rs=ρ/t  \n \n  \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \n \n \n Model copper slurry chemical composition. Compared to CMP for silicon dioxide, the metal \n(particularly copper) CMP process is poorly understood, due mainly to electrochemical interactions \nbetween the slurry and the metal film during polishing, and the coupled effect of these on the mechanical \nproperties of the surface. Optimization of the slurry chemistry for Cu is beyond the scope of this work. \nNevertheless, a meaningful interpretation of the experimental results in terms of MRR and surface \nfinishing can only arise from the understanding of the slurry system and the awareness of the complex \ninteractions between all the slurry components. \n \n  \nCopper CMP mechanism in the model slurry chemistry. The most commonly accepted planarization \nmechanism in metal CMP is Kaufman\u0092s tungsten CMP model [19]. In this model, the slurry chemistry is  \n  \n \n   \n such that it induces formation of a protective passivating film on the metal surface. Passivation could be \ncaused by formation of native metal oxides on the surface using oxidizers such as H2O2. Chemically \nadsorbed layers can also be formed using organic inhibitors. For example, benzotriazole (BTA), a \ncommon corrosion inhibitor for copper, could be utilized in copper CMP slurries [20]. In an ideal CMP \nprocess, the protective film is removed by the mechanical action of the abrasive slurry only at the \nprotruding regions where the wet etch of unprotected metal occurs until metal repassivates. Oxidizers are \nchemical reagents that change the oxidation state of the metal. They have a dual function in the slurry. \nThey can form oxides which protects the recessed regions from the wet etch as well as induce dissolution \nof metal at the protruding regions. Continuous cycles of formation, removal and reformation of the \npassive layer continue until the desired final thickness of planar metal surface is attained. In copper \nchemical mechanical planarization, in addition to wet etching of the unprotected metal surface, the \nchemical reagents in the slurry should also be able to completely dissolve all the abraded material [21]. \nThis is necessary to prevent precipitation of abraded copper particles as well as to avoid redeposition of \ncopper ions back to the wafer. In order to preserve the desired passivation and dissolution behaviour, the \nslurry pH should be always controlled. Copper CMP in a highly acidic pH regime leads to corrosion \nproblems, while Cu CMP in alkaline conditions is faced with an unfavorable polish rate selectivity with \nrespect to SiO2, leading to interlayer dielectric (ILD) erosion. Thus, an intermediate pH range 4-7 appears \nto be a better choice for Cu CMP [22-24]. One of the more attractive slurries in this intermediate pH \nrange consists of hydrogen peroxide, glycine (an amino acid), and an abrasive.  \n \n We measured the MRR and defectivity after each CMP experiment with colloidal silica 90 nm 5wt.% \nand only one of the three chemicals (oxidizer, complexing agent, and corrosion inhibitor) or with a \ncombination of two by two of them.  \n \n Our results plotted in Figure 1a show that although the MRR of copper in a pure H2O2 solution is as \nsmall as 7 nm/min., it increases dramatically (by a factor of 60) in the presence of glycine.  Interestingly, \nall the other combinations of chemicals give lower MRR. The combination of the three chemicals without \nany abrasive leads to a MRR of ca. 150 nm/min.  \n \n The effectiveness of glycine is attributed to hydroxyl radicals, which are responsible for the removal \nof copper from the surface through intermediate oxidation steps, generated copiously through the catalytic \naction of a complex formed by the glycine with the copper ions in solution. The static etch rate for copper \nin the presence of the chemical composition of the model slurry (1vol.% H2O2, 1wt.% Gly, and \n0.018wt.% BTA) in the same pH 5-6 was ca. 10 nm/min., while in the absence of BTA it dramatically \nincreases until 95 nm/min.  Benzotriazole (BTAH-C5H4N3H) has one replaceable H atom attached to the \nN1 atom in the triazole group. The BTA\n \n - ion forms a solid cuprous complex. This complex is known to be \nresponsible for the corrosion inhibiting properties of BTAH [25, 26]. \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 1. a) Thickness removed, b) Non-Uniformity, and c) Sum of defects vs. slurry abrasive type and chemical \ncomposition. \n \n \n It is now worth discussing the role of the hydrogen peroxide as oxidizer during copper CMP.

We experimentally found that very \nlow oxidizer concentrations lead to high NU and defectivity values. Particularly interesting is the AFM \nanalysis of the copper surface after CMP with 5wt.% composite B abrasive in the presence of 0.1 and \n10vol.% H2O2 shown in Figure 2 a and b, respectively. The different morphology of the two surfaces is \nimmediately evident.  The former exhibits higher RMS roughness and copper rip-out kind of defects very \nsimilar to the defects appearing on the copper surface after etching for 1 min. in pure chemicals, Figure 2 \nc. The depth of the voids created is more than double the value of the scratches observed in the presence \nof 10wt.% oxidizer. The plot of the RMS and Ra roughness versus oxidizer concentration shown in \nFigure 3 highlights the increase in the surface roughness with decreasing oxidizer concentration.   From \nthe shape of the defects shown in Figure 2 a and c we can formulate the hypothesis that there is a \npreferential attack and penetration of the chemicals along the copper grain boundaries. This effect sums \nup to the frictional forces acting during CMP (i.e. stick-slip) [25, 26].   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 2.

Nevertheless, the total number of defects is below 2200 defects. \n \n As we already found for oxide CMP defectivity vs. composite core/shell size ratio [27], the use of the \nlargest size polymer as a core in composite A leads to the lowest amount of defectivity and lowest \nmaximum scratch depth. When used in the composite shell, the small 15 nm silica particles remain on the \nwafer after the post-CMP cleaning step. They affect both the total defect number and the RMS roughness. \nMoreover, smallest particles are more prone to agglomeration and larger agglomerates cause an increase \nin pit and scratch counts. \n \n Improvement in the NU and RMS roughness (Figure 6) is achieved by using electrostatic interactions \nto create a bond between the polymer core and the silica shell (composite B). A MRR higher than 300 \nnm/min. is achieved using composite B with 5wt.% 300 nm polymer core - 90 nm silica shell, 5 wt% 300 \nnm polymer core - 15 nm silica shell, and 5wt% 300 nm polymer particles in the presence of 10-4 M \nCTAHS. The use of surfactants during copper CMP is particularly attractive due to the effect of MRR \nenhancement that allows polishing with softer abrasives such as polymer particles. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6. a) Thickness removed, b) Sum of defects, and c) RMS Roughness vs. composite B/pmma abrasive type. \n \n \n 520\n \n 459\n \n 128 115\n \n 0\n \n 100\n \n 200\n \n 300\n \n 400\n \n 500\n \n 600\n \n Sil 600 5% Coll 90 5% Coll 30 5% Coll 15 5%\n \n Slurry\n \n T\nh\n \n ic\nk\n \n n\ne\n \n ss\n r\n \n e\nm\n \n o\nve\n \n d\n (n\n \n m\n)\n \n 405\n \n 354\n \n 126\n \n 532\n \n 0\n \n 100\n \n 200\n \n 300\n \n 400\n \n 500\n \n 600\n \n Sil 600 5% Coll 90 5% Coll 30 5% Coll 15 5%\n \n Slurry\n \n S\nu\n \n m\n o\n \n f d\nef\n \n e\nct\n \n s\n \n a 5.8\n \n 2 1.9 1.7\n \n 0\n \n 1\n \n 2\n \n 3\n \n 4\n \n 5\n \n 6\n \n 7\n \n Sil 600 5% Coll 90 5% Coll 30 5% Coll 15 5%\n \n Slurry\n \n R\nM\n \n S\n R\n \n o\nu\n \n g\nh\n \n n\nes\n \n s \n(n\n \n m\n)b              c \n \n  \n \n 0\n \n 5\n \n 10\n \n 15\n \n 20\n \n 25\n \n 30\n \n 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000\n \n x (nm)\n \n z \n(n\n \n m\n)\n \n a \n \n 161\n203 222\n \n 480\n \n 220\n \n 309\n \n 54\n \n 469\n \n 0\n \n 100\n \n 200\n \n 300\n \n 400\n \n 500\n \n 600\n \n B\n 6\n \n 00\n/9\n \n 0 \n5%\n \n B\n 6\n \n 00\n/3\n \n 0 \n5%\n \n B\n 6\n \n 00\n/1\n \n 5 \n5%\n \n B\n 3\n \n 00\n/9\n \n 0 \n5%\n \n B\n 3\n \n 00\n/3\n \n 0 \n5%\n \n B\n 3\n \n 00\n/1\n \n 5 \n5%\n \n pm\nm\n \n a3\n00\n \n pm\nm\n \n a3\n00\n \n +C\nT\n \n A\nH\n \n S\n \n Slurry\n \n T\nh\n \n ic\nkn\n \n e\nss\n \n  R\nem\n \n o\nve\n \n d\n (n\n \n m\n)\n \n 812 262 481\n \n 29056\n \n 723 1223 252\n \n 21095\n \n 0\n \n 5000\n \n 10000\n \n 15000\n \n 20000\n \n 25000\n \n 30000\n \n 35000\n \n B\n 6\n \n 00\n/9\n \n 0 \n5%\n \n B\n 6\n \n 00\n/3\n \n 0 \n5%\n \n B\n 6\n \n 00\n/1\n \n 5 \n5%\n \n B\n 3\n \n 00\n/9\n \n 0 \n5%\n \n B\n 3\n \n 00\n/3\n \n 0 \n5%\n \n B\n 3\n \n 00\n/1\n \n 5 \n5%\n \n pm\nm\n \n a3\n00\n \n pm\nm\n \n a3\n00\n \n +C\nT\n \n A\nH\n \n S\n \n Slurry\n \n S\nu\n \n m\n o\n \n f d\nef\n \n ec\nts\n \n 0.9\n \n 0.6\n \n 0.8 0.8\n \n 1\n \n 1.2\n \n 0\n \n 0.2\n \n 0.4\n \n 0.6\n \n 0.8\n \n 1\n \n 1.2\n \n 1.4\n \n B\n 6\n \n 00\n/9\n \n 0\n5%\n \n B\n 6\n \n 00\n/3\n \n 0\n5%\n \n B\n 6\n \n 00\n/1\n \n 5\n5%\n \n B\n 3\n \n 00\n/9\n \n 0\n5%\n \n B\n 3\n \n 00\n/3\n \n 0\n5%\n \n B\n 3\n \n 00\n/1\n \n 5\n5%\n \n Slurry\n \n R\nM\n \n S\n R\n \n o\nu\n \n g\nh\n \n n\nes\n \n s \n(n\n \n m\n)\n \n a b              c  \n  \n \n   \n The cationic surfactant CTAHS acts in synergy with the chemicals in the slurry composition \nimproving the material removal mechanism with increased lubrication. This leads to better NU after \npolishing (< 4%). Unfortunately the presence of particles sticking to the wafer surface after the post-CMP \ncleaning step increases the defect number to ca. 21000. In addition, the RMS roughness and the AFM \nimages of the copper surface after polishing with the polymers in the presence of CTAHS reveal a surface \ncompletely covered by polymer particles. \n \n As already said for composite A, larger polymer cores lead to a low defect count, while the presence \nof the largest 90 nm colloidal silica at the shell increases the defect number.  In Figure 7 a, b , and c the \n3D AFM images of the copper surface after polishing with composite B abrasives for decreasing \ndiameters of the colloidal silica in the shells are shown. The surface damage and scratch/pit depths are \nlower for the smaller size silica particles.   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7. 3D AFM images of the copper surface after CMP with the model slurry chemical composition and a) B \n600-90 5wt%, b) B 600-30 5wt%, and c) B 600-15 5wt% \n \n \n Copper CMP with a soft pad. The effect of the soft Politex pad using the same model slurry chemistry \nalready described for the CMP experiments done with the harder IC-1000 pad and the composite \nabrasives, has been investigated.  \n \n While for the IC-1000 pad a 2 min. diamond conditioning step was foreseen before each polishing run, \nthe Politex pad was rinsed for 1 min. with DI water coming from a high pressure spray gun.  In this case, \nto validate the effectiveness of this procedure, 10 wafers were processed with 5wt.% composite B \nabrasives in the model slurry chemistry and the MRR monitored. A drop in the MRR would indicate pad \nsurface deterioration as a consequence of a non-optimal conditioning step and the presence of polishing \nresidues in the pad asperities. No drop in the MRR (ca. 450 nm/min.) was observed, the NU was also \nconstant and below 6%, and the defect level maintained below 6000 counts.   \n \n Three different polymer core sizes (277, 365, and 432 nm) were investigated and combined with 30 \nnm colloidal silica to form the composites A and B. 360 nm polymer particles and 30 nm silica colloids \nwere compared to the composites in terms of MRR and defectivity. The MRR values of both composites \nA and B are comparable (Figure 8 a).  In both cases an increase in the MRR is observed for the largest \npolymer core size. The surprisingly small MRR reported for the composite A with intermediate core size \nis explained by a non-systematic experimental error due to an inefficient stirring of the slurry \n \n   \n \n 0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n \n 10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n \n 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000\n \n x (nm)\n \n z \n(n\n \n m\n)\n \n a \n \n  \n \n 0\n \n 1\n \n 2\n \n 3\n \n 4\n \n 5\n \n 6\n \n 7\n \n 8\n \n 9\n \n 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000\n \n x (nm)\n \n z \n(n\n \n m\n)\n \n b \n \n  \n \n 0\n \n 0.5\n \n 1\n \n 1.5\n \n 2\n \n 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n \n x (nm)\n \n z \n(n\n \n m\n)\n \n c  \n  \n \n   \n composition. As a consequence, after polishing the three wafers, we noted the presence of a dense \nabrasive mass deposited on the bottom of the slurry container. Therefore, the effective abrasive solid \ncontent in the slurry was much smaller than the claimed 5wt.% leading to a MRR more than 4 times \nsmaller with respect to the expected MRR. In addition, using a soft pad, the MRR observed for \ncomposites A and B with a larger core size almost doubles the MRR value found for the 30 nm colloidal \nsilica.  \n \n Figure 8 b presents the total defect counts after CMP with composites A and B with increasing \npolymer core size. For composite B the defectivity is halved going from the smallest polymer core size to \nthe maximum latex diameter. For composite A with the largest core size the photodetector of the SP1DLS \nwent into overload due to the high defect number. This unexpected result has been justified in terms of \nthe very broad size distribution of the composite particles, as revealed by SEM investigation on samples \ncollected after CMP (insert in Figure 8.26 c).  A map of the defects after polishing with composite B is \nshown as insert in Figure 8.26 c. The defects are mainly localized at the wafer edge and a pattern can be \nrecognized especially in one half of the wafer area. This pattern can be attributed to the Mirra-Mesa brush \ngeometry. \n \n To test the stability of the coverage of the composites in the slurry chemistry during the CMP process, \nSEM investigation was performed before and after CMP. The results are shown in Table 5.  For all the \ncomposites, the coverage is not disrupted by the shear forces and chemistry during the 1 min. polishing \nand the particles show stability during the CMP process.  \n \n In summary, using a soft pad in combination with the composite abrasives allows the achievement of \nMRR that can reach 600 nm/min. MRR enhancements can be obtained using larger polymer cores for \nboth composites A and B.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 8. a) MRR, and b) sum of defects for: D02-D04 polished with composite A core 278 nm, D05-D07 polished \nwith composite A core 365 nm, D08-D010 polished with composite A core 432 nm, D11-D13 polished with \ncomposite B core 278 nm, D14-D16 polished with composite B core 365 nm, D17-D19 polished with composite B \ncore 432 nm, D20-D22 polished with colloidal silica 30 nm. \n \n  \n \n 381\n400 414\n \n 96 98 86\n \n 561 575\n608\n \n 437 423 416 404 418 413\n \n 525 538 519\n \n 331 331 327\n \n 0\n \n 100\n \n 200\n \n 300\n \n 400\n \n 500\n \n 600\n \n 700\n \n D02 D03 D04 D05 D06 D07 D08 D09 D10 D11 D12 D13 D14 D15 D16 D17 D18 D19 D20 D21 D22\n \n R\nR\n \n C\nM\n \n  (n\nm\n \n /m\nin\n \n )\n \n 10151\n \n 13633\n \n 7377\n5388\n \n 9399\n \n 12047\n9767\n \n 11006\n \n 4058\n \n 12750\n \n 4735527342283323\n \n 12899\n \n 26068\n \n 27240\n \n 23799\n \n 0\n \n 5000\n \n 10000\n \n 15000\n \n 20000\n \n 25000\n \n 30000\n \n 35000\n \n D02 D03 D04 D05 D06 D07 D08 D09 D10 D11 D12 D13 D14 D15 D16 D17 D18 D19 D20 D21 D22\n \n Wfr #\n \n S\nu\n \n m\n o\n \n f d\ne\n \n fe\nct\n \n s\n \n a \n \n b  \n  \n \n   \n Table 5.

A model slurry chemistry \nbased on the synergy between a complexing agent (Gly), an oxidizer (H2O2), and a corrosion inhibitor \n(BTA) has been used in combination with composite polymer core \u0096 silica/ceria shell abrasives of various \nsizes. The effect of an increasing oxidizer concentration (from 0.1vol.% to 10vol.%) on the polishing \nperformances of the composite abrasives was also investigated. Copper rip-out types of defects similar to \nthe ones detected on the wafer surface after CMP in pure model slurry chemistry, were observed for low \noxidizer concentration, while shallow scratches and cracks develop for higher oxide layer thicknesses. \n \n Experimental data for copper CMP experiments using two kinds of pad of different hardness have \nbeen also presented. When a medium-high hardness pad is used, for the colloidal silica particles the MRR \nincreases with abrasive size. Copper polishing with polymer colloids is very promising in improving the \nsurface finish, if an optimized chemistry is combined in the slurry formulation. In particular, the addition \nof surfactants such as CTAHS is helpful in increasing the MRR. Unfortunately, in this case the presence \nof a huge amount of polishing debris, polymer particles and surfactant residues on the copper surface after \nthe post-CMP cleaning in DI water made it impossible to draw any conclusions in terms of the impact of \nthe surfactant on defectivity and surface finish.  \n \n Remarkably superior surface quality was observed after polishing with composite B with respect to \npure silica and composite A. The most frequent defect type associated with composite A is pitting and the \nmeasured depth of the holes reaches 80 nm. In addition, a substantial RMS roughness reduction was \nnoted after polishing with composite B and a maximum scratch depth of 20 nm was measured for the \nlargest diameter silica particles in the shell.  \n \n A soft pad interacts with the soft composite particles in a completely different mode compared with a \nmedium/high hardness pad. First of all, after polishing with a soft pad the overall number of defects is \nmuch lower than the total defects counted in the case of a harder pad.  Furthermore, in the former case, \nthe difference between the two composites both in terms of MRR and defectivity is less marked. An \nincrease in the defect count is registered for smaller polymer cores with respect to the larger ones.  \n \n  \n \n BEFORE CMP AFTER CMP \nCore \nsize \n(nm) \n± St. \nDev. \n(nm) \n \n COMPOSITE A \nCOMPOSITE B COMPOSITE A COMPOSITE B \n \n 277.5 \n± 9.0 \n \n     \n \n 364.6 \n± \n \n 15.4 \n \n     \n \n 431.9 \n± \n \n 31.8 \n \n     \nS\n \n IZ\nE\n \n   \n  \n \n   \n   \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n \n The authors wish to thank J.

It connects various process assumptions directly to electrical \nparameters including resistance.  The resistance of narrow copper lines is becoming a \nchallenging parameter, not only in terms of controlling its value but also understanding the \nunderlying mechanisms.  The resistance was measured for 45nm-node interconnects and \ncompared to the theory of electron scattering.  This work will demonstrate how valuable it is to \ndirectly link the electrical models to the physical on-wafer dimensions and in turn to the process \nassumptions.  For example, one can generate a tolerance pareto for physical and or electrical \nparameters that immediately identifies those process sectors that have the largest contribution to \nthe overall tolerance.  It also can be used to easily generate resistance versus capacitance plots \nwhich provide a good BEOL performance gauge.  Several examples for 45nm BEOL will be \ngiven to demonstrate the value of these tools. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n \n When a new technology node gets introduced to its development phase there is typically \nlittle or no silicon data.  In this concept stage most of the technology definition and elements are \ntherefore based on assumptions.  One considers the learning from prior technologies as well as \nnew material and process candidates that are presented by the research community.  The result is \na set of assumptions that best describes what is expected to happen on wafer for each of the \nprocessing steps.  This set is commonly referred to as the process assumptions.  As real silicon \ndata becomes available it can be used to update and refine the process assumptions. \n \n This work describes how to set up the process assumptions and directly link it to \nelectrical models.  The result is a valuable tool that can be used to evaluate various BEOL \noptions and to validate a BEOL technology. \n \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1079 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1079-N02-01 \n  \n \n   \n SETTING UP BEOL PROCESS ASSUMPTIONS \n \nCapturing processing details \n  \n Each processing step on the wafer can be captured by a schematic and a simple set of \nequations.  Figure 1 shows an example for metal 1 where the contact module is followed by a \ndielectric deposition, lithography and etch. \n \n \n D\n \n resist\n \n OE H\n \n  \nFigure 1:  Schematic of how metal 1 could be formed.  In this case metal 1 is formed by the \ndeposition of single dielectric film and patterning using lithography and etch. \n \nThe metal 1 dielectric deposition thickness is indicated by D.  To build in adequate overetch the \nRIE team targets a thicker film: E. Assuming the etch selectivity to the dielectric in the contact \nmodule is s, the following expressions are obtained for the overetch OE and the line height H \nafter metal 1 etch: \n \n  ( )DEOE s −= 1        (1) \n ( ) EDH ss 111 +−=        (2) \n \n \n It is tempting to write the line height as H=D+OE which is of course correct, but D and OE are \nnot independent parameters. Hence, one cannot use this equation to calculate the tolerances.  \nEquation 2 has independent process parameters (D and E) and can be RSSed (Root of the Sum of \nthe Squares) to compute the tolerances in H. \n Although the deposition and etch processes are independent in this example, their target \nvalues have to be set consistently of course.  Not only with respect to each other, but also \nconsistent with the technology targets that need to be achieved.  One can continue to capture the \nnext set of processes (and modules) and write the various line and via dimensions as function of \nthe independent process parameters.  With these equations it is then possible to solve for some or \neven all of the process targets by using the technology (final on-wafer) targets and constraints.  \nFor example, one constraint could be to set the worst-case metal 1 overetch to 20%.  Figure 2 \nshows the process flow schematically.  \n  \n \n   \n Other process targets \n(not part of input)\n \n Final (on-wafer) \ntolerances\n \n Electrical targets and \ntolerances\n \n Calculate:\n \n Other process targets \n(not part of input)\n \n Final (on-wafer) \ntolerances\n \n Electrical targets and \ntolerances\n \n Calculate:\n \n Target Dimensions\n \n Process Tolerances\n \n Minimum set of \nprocess targets / \n \n constraints\n \n Input:\n \n Target Dimensions\n \n Process Tolerances\n \n Minimum set of \nprocess targets / \n \n constraints\n \n Input:\n \n  \nFigure 2:  Schematic of how the process assumptions can be setup. The left box indicates the \ninput which includes the target (or final on-wafer) dimensions.  The right side indicates the \ninstantaneous feedback from simple calculations \n \nThis setup is very powerful and can easily be implemented in a spreadsheet such as Excel.  It \nautomatically adjusts the various process targets when a change is made in target dimensions and \nor/tolerances.  The whole set of process assumptions is self-consistent. \n \nIncluding electrical models \n  \n Electrical models can also be incorporated in the flow that is shown in Figure 2.  Perhaps \nthe most difficult parameter is the resistance of narrow Cu lines.  The Cu resistivity starts to \nincrease as the interconnect dimensions approach the electron mean free path in Cu.  This \nphenomena has been studie since the 1940s [1-3].  The most conventional and elegant approach \nis to solve the Boltzmann transport equation. Although detailed knowledge of the scattering \ninteractions is not required in this case, the values of certain scattering parameters still have to be \ndetermined by experimental data. We follow the work of Steve Rossnagel who has looked in \ndetail at these scattering parameters. The electron mean free path in Cu is assumed to be 39nm. \nThe  other two scattering parameters are p=0.1-0.3 and R=0.3 for surface and grain boundary \nscattering, respectively.  We will discuss the choice of scattering parameters and experimental \ndata in a separate publication [4]. \n Figure 3a shows a cross-sectional TEM of a 45nm BEOL Cu wire of known resistance.  \nThe Boltzmann equation can be solved for this particular geometry and results in a Cu \nconductivity profile which is shown in Figure 3b.  The resistance is then obtained as the \nreciprocal value of the conductivity integral and is in good agreement with the measured \nresistance.  These rather complicated profiles are of course hard to work with in the process \nassumptions.  A profile as drawn in Figure 3c) is more desirable.  Fortunately, the modeled \nresistance of the rectangular profile is very similar to one in Figure 3b).  Please note that the \nprofiles in Figure 3 have the same Cu area and width at half-height.  \n \n Before resistance can be included in the process assumptions flow (Figure 2), one more \nsimplification is required.  Instead of solving the Boltzmann equation which is rather time-\nconsuming, a closed expression is required. For extreme cases (wire dimensions much larger \nthan the electron mean free path) the following expression can be derived [3]  \n \n \n ⎥\n \n ⎦\n \n ⎤\n \n ⎢\n \n ⎣\n \n ⎡\n \n −+⎟\n⎠\n \n ⎞\n \n ⎜\n \n ⎝\n \n ⎛ +−+≈\ngR\n \n R\n \n wh\n \n w\np\n \n λλρρ\n1\n \n 4.11)1(1 830     (3)  \n  \n \n   \n   \n a) b)                      c)\n \n \n Figure 3:  Cross-sectional TEM of a 45nm BEOL wire (a), modeled conductivity profile (b), \nmodeled conductivity profile for rectangular cross section with same Cu area and width at half-\nheight (c). \n \nwhere ρ is the Cu resistivity, ρ0 the bulk resistivity, λ the electron mean free path and g the \naverage Cu grain size. \n Figure 4 shows Cu resistivity data as function of the Cu width at half-height.  The data \nwas obtained by measuring the resistance of various wires (different levels/wafers/lots). The Cu \nresistivity was then calculated by multiplying it with the Cu cross-sectional area as determined \nby TEM.  The solid green line shows the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation.  The \ngrain size g is assumed to be proportional to the linewidth w.  The agreement between the two is \nvery good.  At the smaller Cu dimensions (~50nm), the deviation is 3-4%.  This is still small \ncompared to the spread in the experimental data (appr. ±5%). Note that this data is also \nconsistent with a bulk Cu resistivity of 1.71 µΩ-cm. \n \n Capacitance of BEOL wiring levels is typically obtained by using a field solver and is \nrather time consuming.  In order to include capacitance calculations into the process assumptions \nflow, the parameter space was mapped with a field solver and fit by a simple function.  This is \nvery similar to what is for done extraction decks and accuracy within 1-2% is easily obtained. \n \nTolerance Pareto \n  \n The first section explained how the final on-wafer dimensions can be expressed as \nfunction of the individual process parameters.

The assumptions for the significant unit process sectors are listed next \nto the bars.  The etch rate of the metal trench is 15%.  Litho control the metal CD within 8.5%.  \nThe removal by CMP has a relatively large tolerance of 60%.  The sidewall angle of the trench \nhas a tolerance of 0.5° and the dielectric deposition has a tolerance of 10%.  In this example, the \netch depth is the largest contributor to the variation in capacitance and an effort to reduce this \nvariation should therefore focus on improving the etch depth control.  The reason that CMP \nranks lower in the pareto despite having the largest (relative) tolerance is that total thickness \nremoved by CMP is smaller than the etched depth in this example. \n    \n  \n \n   \n 0%\n \n 10%\n \n 20%\n \n 30%\n \n 40%\n \n 50%\n \n RIE (15%)\n \n Litho CD\n(8.5%)\n \n CMP\n(60%)\n \n Sidewall \nangle \n(0.5°)\n \n ILD\n(10%)\n \n  \nFigure 5:  Capacitance tolerance pareto for a metal 2 wire at 45nm node. The numbers in \nparentheses indicate the unit process tolerances which were made up for this example. \n \n \n One last note for the resistance tolerance pareto. Resistance is a non-linear parameter as it \nis inversely proportional to the Cu area and RSS is therefore not appropriate to calculate the \nresistance tolerances.  The Cu area is the the product of the Cu height and width and therefore \nnon-linear as well.  However, compared to resistance the area is better behaved and more \nnormally distributed then the resistance as will be shown later.  It is therefore a fair assumption \nto assume that the Cu area and reciprocal resistance is normally distributed.  Instead of RSS-ing \nthe resistance and calculating the resistance pareto this way, it is better to calculate the Cu area \ntolerance pareto (which is identical to the resistance tolerance pareto). \n \n   \n \n DISCUSSION  \n \nUsing the process assumptions as a tool to compare integration schemes \n  \n The tolerance pareto is a useful tool when comparing different integration schemes.  To \nillustrate this, the examples in Figure 6a) and b) were made up.  The stack highlighted in a) \nrepresents a conventional metal 2 stack in an ILD that does not have a hardmask when it enters \nthe CMP sector.  The stack in b) integrates a lower dielectric constant film that does require a \nhardmask and the assumption is made that it needs to be polished off to obtain the lowest keff \npossible.  The additional hardmask in the second stack requires a larger etch depth and a larger \nCMP removal.  The assumption was made that tolerances for litho CD, etch depth and CMP \nremoval are the same for both integration schemes: 7%,  8% and 30%, respectively.  For this \nexample, we further assumed that the hardmask required is quite thick: ~40nm.  The final target \ndimensions are assumed to be 150nm tall and 70nm wide.  By following the flow outlined in \nFigure 2, the tolerances are immediately obtained for the two stacks. The metal 2 resistance has a \ntolerance of ~15% without hardmask, but a ~30% with hardmask.  As the paretos indicate, \nvariation in the CMP sector has become the dominant contributor to the resistance tolerances \nwhereas the RIE and litho CD tolerances have fallen to second and third place.   \n \n Again, the stacks and tolerances in Figure 6a) and b) were made up to illustrate the use of \nthe tolerance pareto.  The increased resistance tolerances with the hardmask can of course be \naddressed by minimizing the hardmask thickness as well as increasing the polish selectivity \nbetween the hardmask and the ILD.  \n  \n \n   \n   \n 0%\n \n 10%\n \n 20%\n \n 30%\n \n 40%\n \n 50%\n \n 60%\n \n 70%\n \n Litho RIE CMP Other\n \n 0%\n \n 10%\n \n 20%\n \n 30%\n \n 40%\n \n 50%\n \n 60%\n \n 70%\n \n CMP RIE Litho Other\n \n Hardmask\n \n Resistance Tolerance Pareto Resistance Tolerance Pareto\n \n Removed by CMP\n \n a)                                         b)\n \n \n Figure 6:  Comparison of two integration schemes:  a) ILD without hardmask,  b) ILD with \nhardmask. \n \nResistance versus capacitance \n  \n Resistance is often plotted versus capacitance.  In this section it will be shown that the \nlocation of the RvsC curve is quite \u2018universal\u2019 and provides a good measure  whether or not the \ndielectric constants and Cu volume of the wires are on target. \n When a random generator is added to the process flow in Figure 2 it is very easy to \nproduce an expected RvsC curve as is demonstrated in Figure 7.  The shape and location of this \ncurve can now be instantaneously be verified by changing the input assumptions. Changes in line \nheight and width move the datapoints along the curve.  Changes in liner thickness do not impact \nthe capacitance and the RvsC cloud is expected to move to lower or higher resistance values.  In \ncontrast, changes in via height and dielectric constants do not impact resistance and the RvsC \ncloud now moves to higher or lower capacitance values.  Since only a third of the capacitance \nconsists of vertical coupling, large changes in viaheight are required to significantly move the \nRvsC cloud to different capacitance values. \n  \n  \n \n   \n Resistance\n \n C\nap\n \n ac\nita\n \n nc\ne\n \n Line width \n& height\n \n Dielectric constant \n& via height\n \n Liner volume \nfraction\n \n  \n \n Figure 7:  Resistance vs capacitance plots and dependency on various parameters. \n \n Figure 7 was generated by assuming a trapezoidal shape for the metal wires. In reality, \nhowever, the profiles can be a lot more complicated as is shown in Figure 3a). To verify the \nimpact of a more complicated shape, wires were considered where the bottom of the wire has an \nincreased taper angle.  A few random cases were generated which nominally had the same width \nat half-height and liner volume fraction as the wires in Figure 7.  The capacitance was calculated \nby using a field solver and the resistance was obtained by solving the Boltzmann transport \nequation.  The results are shown in red and compared to the trapezoidal shapes in Figure 8. \n \n \n Resistance\n \n C\nap\n \n ac\nita\n \n nc\ne\n \n  \n \n Figure 8:  Resistance vs capacitance plots for two different profiles. \n  \n  \n \n   \n This simulated data confirms the earlier statement where the location of the RvsC curve \ndepends mostly on the dielectric constants of the various films in the stack and the Cu volume \nand resistivity.  This property is quite useful.  Early silicon data is typically off target for both \nphysical dimensions as well as electrical properties.  However, when the resistance is plotted \nversus resistance, the RC cloud should intersect or approach the technology target, at least within \na few percent. \n \n Figure 9 shows a RvsC comparison of experimental data for a 45nm interconnect in an \nultra-low k dielectric [5] and simulated data for a dielectric constant of 2.4 and 3.0. The location \nof the RvsC clouds validate that the assumptions of k=2.4 and Cu volume and resistivity were \nmet. The shape of the RvsC cloud (thickness and width) are determined by the process \ntolerances.  One cannot validate each process tolerance, but the shape of the cloud should be \nconsistent with the whole set of tolerances.  \n \n  \n \n Resistance\n \n C\nap\n \n ac\nita\n \n nc\ne\n \n 45nm ULK data\nRC simulation (k=2.4)\nRC simulation (k=3.0)\n \n ~15%\n \n  \n \n \n Figure 9:  45nm ULK RvsC data compared to process assumptions for k=2.4 and k=3.0.   \n \nFigure 10 shows experimental RvsC data for two 45nm populations which differ in liner \n \n thickness as can be seen from the two TEMs. The thinner liner shifts the RvsC cloud to lower \nresistances as indicated by the solid black arrow.

The net change is \na drop of 8% in capacitance.  This data demonstrates that the liner thickness is an important \nparameter for the interconnect performance.

Reliability considerations therefore have to be included when \nsetting up process assumptions. This section demonstrates how time-dependent dielectric \nbreakdown (TDDB) and electro-migration (EM) have competing demands that cannot be ignored \nduring the definition phase of a BEOL interconnect technology. \n Figure 11 shows EM data for the via-depletion mode for two populations that have 70nm \nwide wires with different via sizes.  Each of the distributions is clearly bimodal, but this is \nbeyond the scope of this discussion. Focusing simply on the t50, a reduction of 37% is observed \nwhen the via size is reduced from 80 down to 70nm. \n \n \n 1\n \n 5\n \n 10\n \n 25\n \n 50\n \n 75\n \n 90\n \n 95\n \n 99\n \n 99.9\n \n e\nlitn\n \n ecr\neP\n \n Log Normal Probability Plot\n \n C\n \n Time to fail\n \n 1\n \n 5\n \n 10\n \n 25\n \n 50\n \n 75\n \n 90\n \n 95\n \n 99\n \n 99.9\n \n e\nlitn\n \n ecr\neP\n \n Log Normal Probability Plot\n \n C\n \n Time to fail\n \n ~70nm ~80nm\n \n e-e-\n \n  \n \n Figure 11:  Electro-migration data for 45nm interconnects with 70 and 80nm via sizes.  \n  \n \n   \n  \nWhile EM favors a larger via, TDDB stressing of large dense viachains shows that an \n \n increase in via CD results in a significant reduction in the projected lifetimes (~100-1000x !).  \nThis effect is illustrated by the diagrams in Figure 12.  The diagram in Figure 12a) represents the \n70nm vias. As the bottom CD is increased from 70 to 80nm, Figure 12b, the top of the vias \nincrease accordingly and increases the electric field and the chance for catastrophic breakdown. \nThe operating voltages have not been keeping pace with the shrink factors between technology \nnodes.  This increases the burden on process integration to improve the spacing control between \ndifferent nets and keep the worst-case electric field at an acceptable level. \n \n  \n \n topv\n \n topvtopv\n \n botv\n \n topv'\n \n Post-CMP \nplane\n \n topv' topv'\n \n a)                                  b) c)\n \n botv botv botv botvbotv'botv'\n \n topv'\n \n  \nFigure 12:  Schematics illustrating how the top CD increases due to larger bottom CDs (b) or \nnew dielectric films that may be more prone to strip damage or RIE challenges at the via \n \n  \nFigure 12c) shows what could happen as a lower-k dielectric material is introduced. \n \n These films may be more prone to sidewall damage due various plasma exposures. Higher \ncarbon-content in the film may also result in different etch characteristics that alter the profile \nnear the via bottom. Assuming we want to keep the bottom on target, these two effects would \nresult in larger top CDs and may therefore compromise TDDB performance. \n \n  \nProcess Capability \n \n Many chip fabrication plants have been raising their standards when it comes to process \ncapability. Typically Cp/Cpk calculations assume normal distributions. However, non-linear \nparameters such as resistance should be approached carefully.  Figure 13a) shows the resistance \nhistogram and a normal fit for 45nm resistance data. It does not look so bad at first glance, but \nFigure 13b) shows otherwise. The solid red line is a fit to the blue datapoints assuming the \nresistance is normally distributed and a poor match is obtained at the tails of the distribution.  \nSince the resistance is inversely proportional to the Cu area, one can get a better fit by assuming \nthe area and, in turn, 1/resistance is normally distributed.  As the solid green line shows a much \nbetter fit is obtained.  \n \n To highlight the importance for process capability, a hypothetical reliability spec limit is \nplaced as indicated by the red dashed line. This spec limit could, for example, correspond to a Cu \narea which is too small to support the currents used in the designs. The process capability as \nextracted from a single sided Cpk would be significantly different for the two different fits (R \nnormal and 1/R normal): 1.5 versus 1.1. \n \n bottom (c).   \n  \n \n   \n   \n -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4\n \n z\n \n R\ne\n \n si\nst\n \n a\nnc\n \n e\n \n R normal\n \n Target\n \n Spec limit\n \n 1/R normal\n \n Target Spec limitTarget Spec limit\n \n a)                                                              b)  \n  \nFigure 13: 45nm resistance data: a) histogram, b) distribution with a normal and non-normal fit. \n \n \n CONCLUSIONS \n \n \n It has been shown how the process assumptions can directly link the unit processes to the \nelectrical targets and tolerances.  The process assumptions can be made self-consistent by \nimplementing proper constraints. The result is a tool where one can change final on-wafer target \ndimensions and unit process tolerances and get immediate feedback on physical tolerances and \nelectrical parameters. A tolerance pareto calculation was added to identify those processes that \nhave the largest impact on the overall tolerance. The tool can also be used to generate resistance \nversus capacitance curves. It has been shown that the location of these curves are rather \ninsensitive to the wire dimensions and therefore a good performance gauge for the dielectric \nconstants in the BEOL stack as well as the Cu area and resistivity. The Cu resistivity is a \ncomplex parameter and depends on electron scattering at surface and grain boundaries. \nExperimental data from 45nm and simple models were found to be in good agreement. \n \n \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n \n This work has been supported by the independent Bulk CMOS and SOI technology \ndevelopment projects at the IBM Microelectronics, Div.

However, the effect of the \nelectric current on the microstructure of interconnect lines during the very early stage of \nelectromigration is not well documented.  In the present report, we used synchrotron radiation \nbased polychromatic X-ray microdiffraction for the in-situ study of the electromigration induced \nplasticity effects on individual grains of an Al (Cu) interconnect test structure.  Dislocation slips \nwhich are activated by the electric current stressing are analyzed by the shape change of the \ndiffraction peaks.  The study shows polygonization of the grains due to the rearrangement of \ngeometrically necessary dislocations (GND) in the direction of the current.  Consequences of \nthese findings are discussed. \n \n INTRODUCTION   \n \n Electromigration (EM) refers to the mass transport phenomenon of materials due to \nelectric current when the current density reaches high values.  This phenomenon can have \ndeleterious effects on microelectronic devices such as integrated circuits (ICs) [1].  In very-large-\nscale integration (VLSI) of circuits on a Si device, Al or Cu thin-film line can experience current \ndensity as high as 106 A/cm2, which is enough to cause the atomic motion from the cathode end \nto the anode end at the device working temperature.  Thus voids may form at the cathode end \nand extrusion may be squeezed out at the anode end, respectively [2].  Although a lot of models \nhave been proposed to understand the mechanism of EM [3-6] , the effect of the atomic transport \non the dislocation movement and local material microstructure, especially in the early stage of \nEM is still unclear.   \n \n High brilliance X-ray beam with submicron to micron beam size can be produced by \nfocusing optics such as Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) mirrors at synchrotron facilities [7, 8].  X-ray \nmicrodiffraction has been developed for the crystal microstructure study.  In this technique, since \nthe crystal grains are larger than the X-ray beam size, a single crystal Laue diffraction pattern is \nobtained when polychromatic (white beam) X-ray impinges on the sample.  By analyzing the \nLaue diffraction pattern, the orientation and strain information of the material irradiated can be \nobtained, and the spatial resolution is only limited by the size of the focused X-ray beam.   \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1079 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1079-N05-02 \n  \n \n   \n Previous works have shown the potential of Laue X-ray microdiffraction for EM study on \ninterconnect lines [9-15].  In the present report, we report a more in-depth microstructure study \nin an Al (0.5 wt % Cu) interconnect during the early stage of electromigration.  \n \n EXPERIMENTAL   \n \n  The EM test sample is a sputtered 30 μm long, 4.1 μm wide and 0.75 μm thick Al (0.5 wt \n% Cu) two-level structure.  A 450 Å thick Ti layer at the bottom of the Al line, as well as another \nlayer with 100 Å thick on the top, is used as shunt.  The Al line is constrained by a 0.7 μm \nthickness SiO2 passivation layer.  Several W vias are used for electrical connection between this \nAl line and unpassivated Al (Cu) pads at each end.  The sample is annealed at 390 oC in a rough \nvacuum for 30 min to stabilize the crystal structure before EM test.   \n The in-situ X-ray microdiffraction experiment was conducted on beamline 7.3.3 at the \nAdvanced Light Source synchrotron in Berkeley, CA [16].  The X-ray beam size is 0.7 x 0.7 \nμm2.  The wired-bonded sample and an X-ray CCD detector are mounted at 45o and 90o with \nrespect to the beam, respectively.  The CCD detector is fixed at 5 cm above the sample when \nwhite beam Laue diffractions are recorded.  \n \n The EM test is conducted at a 224 oC (heater temperature) and the current density is \nramped up to 0.98×106 A/cm2 (I=30 mA) and maintained constant for 45 hours.  Before and \nduring the EM test, Laue diffraction patterns are recorded by scanning the sample repeatedly by \nthe submicron-sized white beam.  The scanning step size is 0.5 μm, so 15 steps across the width \nof the line, 65 steps along the length, and a total of 975 CCD frames are needed to cover the \nwhole surface of the sample for each scan.  The exposure time is set as 5 seconds so that the \nintensity of the diffraction peaks is strong but not saturated.  The electronic readout time for each \nframe is about 10 seconds.  As a result, for each scan, it takes about 4 to 5 hours.  The Laue \ndiffraction data are analyzed using the custom written XMAS software [11, 17].  \n \n RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS \n \n Dislocation active slip systems   \n \n Large grains in the Al interconnect line, especially those that span across the width of the \nline (\u201cbamboo\u201d type), are subject to opposite stress moments on opposite sides across the width.  \nWhen a certain yield stress was reached, these grains would bend and ultimately polygonize [10].  \n \n This aspect of plastic deformation results in broadening of the Laue spots along certain \ndirections compatible with the bending direction due to the arrangement of excess geometrically \nnecessary dislocations (GNDs).  Different dislocation slips can result in different shapes of the \nLaue peaks.  As a result, analysis of the Laue spot broadening patterns allows for the \nidentification of the active dislocation glide system that produced the bending.   \n \n First the orientation of a given grain is known by indexing the Laue pattern.  Secondly, \nall the possible streaking directions of the Laue peaks are simulated, each of which corresponds \nto a certain dislocation slip system.  Since Al has FCC crystal structure, for each grain, there are \n12 possible slip types, all of which are {111}/<110> oriented, which means 12 possibilities for  \n  \n \n   \n both edge dislocations and screw dislocations.  Then all of these 24 simulated diffraction patterns \nare compared with the experimental result, and the best fitting will tell the real dislocation slip \ntype.  In figure 1(a), the white streaking peaks are from one of the typical Laue patterns of a \ndeformed grain after 12 hours EM test, and the yellow patterns are the best matched simulation \n \n result.  In this example, the slip plane is (111) ; the Burger\u2019s vector is along the [101] direction; \nand the dislocations are edge typed, so the dislocation line direction is perpendicular to the slip \n \n plane normal and Burger\u2019s vector, which is along [121]  for this case.  Figure 1(b) is the pole \nfigure of this grain, with all <112> directions marked and the activated direction circled.  In this \nfigure, the x direction is along the electric current flow direction and the y direction is along the \n \n width direction of the Al line.  It is found that the dislocation direction [121]  is the direction \nbelonging to the <112> family and closest to the current flow direction.   \n \n  \n \n    \nFigure 1. (a) Simulated Laue patterns comparing with the experimental results, and (b) pole \nfigure of this grain with all <112> directions marked \n \n \n The activated slip systems in 30 grains have been analyzed in this way.  All the \ndislocations are found to be edge typed and about 90 % of the dislocation lines are contained \nwithin 5o with respect to the current flow direction.  The dislocations which don\u2019t obey this rule \nare located close to the cathode end.  We propose that the alignment of the edge type dislocations \nalong the electric current flow direction is resulted from the minimization of the electrical \nresistance because the scattering between electrons and dislocations is anisotropic.  The \ndislocations at the cathode end are not aligned regularly because electrons enter the Al line here \nand the electron motion directions are more disordered.  The realignment of dislocations will \nalso influence the atomic diffusion inside the line by affecting the diffusion route.  The detailed \nkinetic study is still underway and will be the subject of a forecoming paper.   \n \n  At higher tensile stress region, in other words, closer to the cathode, a secondary slip \nsystem can be activated, and the Laue patterns are broadened in two different directions, as \nshown in figure 2(a).  This grain is located at about 6 μm away from the cathode end.  In this \nexample, the two dislocation line directions are [112]  and [112] , respectively.  The pole figure of \n \n this grain, shown as figure 2(b), shows that, as expected, [112]  is the direction that is the closest \n \n to the current flow direction in <112> family, while [112]  is located on the edge of the circle in \n \n (a) (b)  \n  \n \n   \n the pole figure, which represent the XY plane, rather than the second closest direction.  At even \nhigher stress level, multiple slip systems are activated.  Figure 2(c) is the enlarged (113) peak of \na grain locating at about 2 μm to the cathode end.  The Laue diffraction patterns become \ncomplicated since dislocations slip in different orientations, as indexed in the figure.  \nFurthermore, the diffraction peak splitting suggests the formation of subgrains.  Since all those \nsubgrains have slightly different orientations, each subpeak in the Laue pattern represents a \nsubgrain in the irradiated volume in the sample.  From figure 2(d), which shows all the <112> \ndirections in this grain, it is clearly observed that one of the several activated dislocation line \ndirections is along the current direction, while the others are all within the XY plane.     \n \n  \n \n    \n \n    \nFigure 2. (a) Simulated Laue patterns of a grain which has two slip systems activated and (b) the \npole figure of this grain, (c) enlarged (113) diffraction peaks from a grain 2 μm to the cathode \nend showing the multiple activated slip system and subgrain formation and (b) the pole figure  \n \n The secondary slip system, which is within the XY plane, can be roughly explained by \nthe activation of the slip systems of the subgrains formed by EM.  Since each of the subgrains \nhas slightly different orientation and is subjected at different local shear stress status, the slip \nsystem activated within each subgrain could be different.  In other words, the secondary system \nis activated at a different location in the grain comparing with the primary system.  However, the \ndetailed mechanism is not well understood yet.   \n \n (a) (b) \n \n (d) (c) \n \n of this grain  \n  \n \n   \n Subgrain formation \n \n As mentioned above, polygonization happens on large grains close to the cathode by \nsubgrain formations, as indicated by the observation of the subpeaks in some Laue diffraction \npatterns.  In order to study this process, we have tracked the shape evolution of the Laue peaks of \nten grains in which subgrains were formed.  Figure 3 shows a series of (022) diffraction peaks \nproduced by the same grain after different period of EM test.  Before the EM test the peak is \ninitially sharp, indicating that there are not many dislocations in the grain.  As the EM test \ncontinues for 15 hours, the peak is broadened more and more in two directions, which indicates \nthat the grain is bended gradually by the electric current in two different directions, but generally \nthere are no obvious subpeaks in this period.  In figure 3(d), the diffraction peak becomes \nbroadened after 21.5 hours current stressing, and three subpeaks are observed, though not very \nclearly separated.  Thus at this stage, the dislocations are partially aligned to form the subgrain \nboundary.  After 25 hours EM test, two subpeaks can be very clearly observed and separated.  \nThe separation of the two peaks is larger than the maximum broadening in figure 3(d).  Both of \nthe two subpeaks are much sharper than the streaking in figure 3(d), indicating that most of the \ndislocations are concentrated and aligned at the subgrain boundary.   \n \n  \n \n  \nFigure 3. (022) diffraction peaks from the same grain after (a) 0 hr, (b) 6.5hr, (c) 15hr, (d) 21.5 \nhr, and (e) 25 hr EM test \n \n Generally, subgrain forms by the realignment of the dislocations when they reach certain \ndensity.  More detailed quantitative study, both experimentally and theoretically, is required to \nunderstand the kinetics of this procedure.      \n \n CONCLUSION \n \n In this paper, using polychromatic X-ray beam microdiffraction, we have studied the \nplastic deformation of the Al interconnect line induced by EM.  The activated slip systems have \nbeen studied from the shape change of the diffraction peaks.  It is found that all the dislocations \nare edge typed.  With relative low stress, only the slip system with the dislocation line direction \nwhich is the closest to electric current flow direction is activated while under high stress above \ncertain critical value, more slip system can be activated besides the one along the current \n \n I \n \n II \n \n III \n \n I \n \n II \n \n (a) (b) (c) (d) (e)  \n  \n \n   \n direction, and the secondary ones prefer to be within the XY plane.  Furthermore, the evolution \nof the diffraction peaks has been carefully studied.  The bending of the crystal plane indicated by \nthe elongation of the diffraction peaks and resulted from the rearrangement of the geometrically \nnecessary dislocations results in the peak splitting and subgrain boundary formation by the \nrealignment of the dislocations.    \n \n ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  \n \n The Advanced light Source is supported by the Director, Office of Science, Office of \nBasic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-\n05CH11231 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory \n \n \n REFERENCES \n \n 1.

CNT via-conduits may greatly improve heat dissipation and as such \nlower interconnect resistance and improve electromigration resistance. Each carbon shell of the  \nnanotube contributes to electrical and thermal conduction and densities as high as 5x1013 shells \nper cm2 are estimated necessary. CNT growth processes on BEOL compatible metals are \npresented with tube densities up to 1012cm-2 and shell densities approaching 1013 cm-2 on blanket \nsubstrates. Selective growth of CNT bundles with carbon shell densities around 1012cm-2 is \ndemonstrated with high yield. Ohmic behavior of TiN/CNT/Ti contacts is shown with a CNT via \nresistivity of 1.2 mΩ cm.  \n \n \n INTRODUCTION \n \n \n Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are one-dimensional hollow nanostructures with extreme aspect \nratios and exceptional mechanical, thermal and electrical properties [1]. One could picture a \nCNT by rolled-up sheets of graphene: a single graphene layer forms a single-walled (SW-), a \ndouble-layer forms a double-walled (DW), and multiple layers form a multi-walled (MW) tube. \nA single CNT can be as narrow as 0.4nm for the smallest SW-CNT and several hundred  \nnanometer in diameter for MW-CNT [2]. Electrical conductance of ideal metallic CNT is \nballistic and thus independent of length in contrast to metal conductors such as copper where \nconductance is determined by electron scattering. In addition, CNT can carry extreme current \ndensities up to 109 A/cm2 compared to about 106-107 A/cm2 for (capped) interconnect lines. \nMaybe even more important for interconnect applications is the high thermal conductivity which \nis expected to be 5 to 10 times higher than copper. In this paper, the possibility to replace copper \nvia interconnects in the BEOL stack by bundles of densely-packed CNT will be presented.  \n \n A CNT bundle can be considered a series of conducting shells in parallel and its \nresistance is determined by the total number of shells in the bundle. For example, a bundle of \n \n two SW-CNT and two DW-CNT has a total of four CNT (N=4) and six shells ( 6\n0\n \n =∑\nN\n \n sCNTn ), \nwith nsCNT the number of shells in a particular CNT. For CNT with not too large diameter \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1079 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1079-N06-01 \n  \n \n   \n (d<20nm), the resistance of a single CNT shell (RsCNT) can be taken equal to the resistance of a \nsingle-walled CNT (diameter independent) and the total resistance is then given by: \n \n   \n \n ∑\n \n = 0,\n \n N\nsCNT\n \n sCNT\nbundleCNT\n \n n\n \n R\nR      .  (1)  \n \n The resistance of a CNT shell is given by: \n   \n \n   llRR phonoptphonacCNTmetallicSWquantumsCNT .., ρρ ++=    (2) \nwith a first term for the fixed quantum resistance (6.5kΩ), and two terms for acoustic and optical \nphonon scattering, respectively, which are both linear with length, l, of the CNT [3]. Similar \nresults were obtained by N. Srivastava et al [4, 5]. From best know literature values [6-8], a \nquantitative relation for equation (2) was derived: \n \n     \n \n mlV\n \n llR\nmsCNT μμ 01.02.0\n \n 650055006500\n+×\n \n ×Ω\n+×+Ω= Ω  .  (3)  \n \n Note that the term for optical phonon scattering is dependent on the voltage over the CNT \ninterconnect bundle. Based on equations (1) and (3) comparison can be made with copper and \nthe example of 9nm lines will be discussed.  \n \n From equation (1) it follows that the lowest resistance is obtained for the highest CNT \nshell density. Higher shell densities can be obtained by stacking many SWCNT closely together \nin one space than by having one MW-CNT in the same space. For example, in a box of 2.5nm by \n2.5nm one can fit fourteen SW-CNT of 0.4nm diameter with a minimum spacing of 0.34nm in a \nclose-packed arrangement compared with one 2.5nm MW-CNT with a maximum of four walls. \nThe former case represents the upper limit of stacking density with 2x1014 shells per cm2. Figure \n1 shows the variations in resistance with interconnect length for cylindrical 9nm Cu line and \nCNT bundles with two packing densities. The resistance of the CNT bundles is much less \ndependent on wire length due to the small scattering rate in CNT compared to Cu. Hence, CNT \nbundles could lower the resistance of longer interconnect structures especially for highest shell \ndensities. Unfortunately, CNT bundles as horizontal interconnect lines are currently \ntechnologically not possible and CNT bundles are only considered at the via or contact levels. \nFor very short lengths (the 9nm via would have a height of 20nm), however, the CNT resistance \nis worse than copper even for maximum packing density. Since both the delay and dynamic \npower, and thus the performance, are dominated by the interconnect capacitance and not by the \ninterconnect resistance (for typical resistance values), a reasonable increase in resistance is \ntolerable. Even so, what would be the benefit of CNT bundles when they can not match the \nresistance of the copper vias? Well, there is of course the much higher current-carrying capacity \n(2-3 orders of magnitude better than Cu) which will improve electromigration. More importantly, \nthere is the high thermal conductivity of the CNT vias that will significantly improve heat \ndissipation and as such have a beneficial impact on the resistance as well as on the \nelectromigration of the total Cu-CNT hybrid stack. N. Srivastava et al have calculated that the \nintegration of high- density CNT bundles at the via level would keep the temperature of the Cu-\nCNT hybrid stack below 300C for the 22nm NODE whereas a Cu-only BEOL stack would run at \ntemperatures above 600C [4, 5]. To keep the resistance of a few micron long CNT-via/Cu-\nline/CNT-via structure comparable to that of a Cu-only via-chain structure, an estimated CNT \nshell density of 5x1013 cm-2 or higher will be necessary. Such shell densities can be obtained by a \nclosed packed stacking of either SW-CNT with diameters between 0.4 and 1.2 nm, DW-CNT  \n  \n \n   \n with diameters between 1.08 and 1.8nm, triple-walled CNT with diameters between 1.76 and \n2.4nm, quadruple-walled CNT with diameter between 2.44 and 2.7nm and even quintuple-walled \nCNT with a diameter of 3.12nm.                              \n \n  \n \n 9nm diameter conduit\n \n 10\n \n 100\n \n 1000\n \n 10000\n \n 0.01 0.1 1 10\nlenght (um)\n \n R \n(oh\n \n m\n)\n \n R(1e13CNT/cm2), 1V\n \n R(1e13CNT/cm2); 0.1V\n \n R(1e13CNT/cm2),\nballistic\nRcu(9nm)\n \n R(2e14CNT/cm2); 1V\n \n R(2e14CNT/cm2); 0.1V\n \n R(2e14CNT/cm2),\nballistic\n \n 1013 CNT/cm2\n \n 2x1014 CNT/cm2\nballistic\n \n ballistic\n \n 0.1V\n \n 0.1V\n \n 1V\n \n 1V\n \n 9nm\n \n 9nm\n \n 9nm\n \n Cu\n \n 9nm diameter conduit\n \n 10\n \n 100\n \n 1000\n \n 10000\n \n 0.01 0.1 1 10\nlenght (um)\n \n R \n(oh\n \n m\n)\n \n R(1e13CNT/cm2), 1V\n \n R(1e13CNT/cm2); 0.1V\n \n R(1e13CNT/cm2),\nballistic\nRcu(9nm)\n \n R(2e14CNT/cm2); 1V\n \n R(2e14CNT/cm2); 0.1V\n \n R(2e14CNT/cm2),\nballistic\n \n 1013 CNT/cm2\n \n 2x1014 CNT/cm2\nballistic\n \n ballistic\n \n 0.1V\n \n 0.1V\n \n 1V\n \n 1V\n \n 9nm\n \n 9nm\n \n 9nm\n \n Cu\n \n 1013 CNT/cm2\n \n 2x1014 CNT/cm2\nballistic\n \n ballistic\n \n 0.1V\n \n 0.1V\n \n 1V\n \n 1V\n \n 9nm9nm\n \n 9nm\n \n 9nm\n \n Cu\n \n  \n \n Figure 1.

Also the ballistic limit for both densities is shown. \n \n \n Growth of densely-packed CNT carpets can be achieved by catalytic CVD directly on a \nsubstrate surface after formation of Fe, Co or Ni based catalyst nanoparticles [9]. Most growth \nstudies are done on SiO2 surfaces where SW and DW CNT with densities of 1012 cm-2 and higher \nare easily obtained after proper catalyst activation step [10-12]. By using sandwiched layers with \naluminum (which oxidize into alumina) very high densities were obtained [13]. For interconnect \napplications the CNT bundles need to be grown on metals and preferably liner materials such as \nTa, TaN and TiN. Unfortunately, the obtained CNT densities are typically lower on metal \nsubstrates [14]. At IMEC a process was developed for high-density growth on Ti-based \nsubstrates [15]. Growth of CNT bundles in via holes down to 150nm in diameter with shell \ndensities of 1012 cm-2 was demonstrated. Ohmic current-voltage characteristics were obtained for \nthe TiN/CNT/Ti contacts with a minimum equivalent resistivity of 1.2mΩ cm.                                       \n \n \n RESULTS and DISCUSSION \n \n \n CNT growth on blanket substrates: effect of catalyst activation  \n  \n \n  Figure 2a shows a cross-sectional SEM image of a densely packed CNT carpet grown \nfrom a 0.5nm Fe film deposited with ion-beam sputtering on top of Ti(5nm)/SiO2/Si wafers. \nSince the wafers had been exposed to air for considerable time before Fe deposition, the actual \nstack was Fe/TiO2/Ti on SiO2. Catalyst activation was done right before growth by treatment in \nhydrogen plasma (1 Torr H2, 200W high-frequency plasma) at 650C for 5 minutes. Growth was \nachieved by thermal CVD (same chamber) in 1 Torr acetylene (C2H2) at 650C. Growth of \ndensely aligned and straight CNT was observed with a length of 28um for 60min of deposition. \nFigure 2b shows a high-resolution TEM image of a single CNT plucked from the CNT mat. The  \n  \n \n   \n CNT diameter was typically between 6 and 8 nm with 7 to 10 shells per CNT. The carbon \ndensity of the CNT film was estimated at 0.43g/cm3 by simulation of the X-ray reflectivity \n(XRR) spectra. From the measured carbon density, an average CNT diameter of 7nm, and an \naverage of 8 shells per CNT, the density of tubes was estimated 9x1011 cm-2 and thus \napproaching 1013 shells per cm2.  \nPlasma activation of the catalyst was found to be a crucial factor for growth and determined both \nthe CNT density and growth rate, under similar growth conditions. In the absence of plasma \n(thermal activation in H2 only) sparse growth was observed. Conversely, extended plasma \nactivation times also degraded growth as the catalyst material was eroded away. When the \ncatalyst activation conditions were changed to 4 Torr H2, 300W low-frequency plasma for the \nsame time (5 minutes), the CNT density dropped by a factor of 10 while the growth rate \nincreased by a factor of 10 as compared with the CNT in figure 2. Hence, for each plasma-\nenhanced catalyst activation condition, an optimum time needs to be found for the plasma-\nassisted formation of nanoparticles to achieve high densities while avoiding undesired erosion of \nthe catalyst material. Note that achieving fast growth rates does not necessarily imply optimum \nconditions since it typically indicates lower density (under same growth conditions). When \nchanging the growth conditions while keeping the catalyst activation the same, the CNT density \nwas found the same while the growth rate was changing. Hence, the catalyst activation step \ndetermines the effective CNT density (and diameter) whereas the growth rate (for same density) \nis determined by the CNT growth conditions. \n \n \n   (a) \n \n XRR 0.43 g/cm\n \n 3\n \n ~10\n \n 12\n \n CNTs/cm\n \n 2\n \n 10 μm\n \n 36 μm\n \n 650C*\n \n   (b) \n \n 6.5\n \n 6.7nm\n \n 7.0\n \n HRTEM\n \n 6 walls\n \n  \n \n Figure 2. Cross-sectional SEM image of densely aligned CNT carpet (a) and high-resolution \nTEM image of single MW-CNT (b). CNT were grown from 0.5nm Fe catalyst deposited with \nion-beam sputtering on 5nm PVD Ti layer on SiO2/Si substrate: 5 minutes plasma-enhanced \ncatalyst activation at 650C in 1Torr H2 with 200W high-frequency plasma and 60 minutes \n \n growth at 650C in 1 Torr acetylene (C2H2). \n \n \n CNT growth on blanket substrates: effect of under layer \n \n \n  CNT growth with 0.5nm Fe catalyst was compared for Al, Ti, TiN and Ta/TaN layers on \nSiO2/Si wafers. The first two combinations are prone to oxidation and the metal surfaces will be \ncompletely transformed in Al2O3 and TiO2 surfaces, respectively (Al and Ti will also react with \nthe SiO2 underlayer at higher temperatures). The nitride compounds are more stable to oxidation \nand will be primarily metallic. In all cases straight aligned growth of multi-walled CNT was \nobtained, with higher tube density for the oxide surfaces (~1012 cm-2) compared to the metallic \nsurfaces (~1011 cm-2). The average diameter of the grown tubes was 6-9 nm on the oxide surfaces \ncompared to 8-12 nm on the metallic surfaces. Since surface diffusion is inhibited on oxide  \n  \n \n   \n surfaces, higher densities of smaller catalyst particles can be obtained during the plasma-\nenhanced thermal treatment during catalyst activation step. Interestingly, the CNT growth \nmechanism was found to be base growth (i.e. Fe remains on surfaces) for the Al2O3 and TiO2 \nsurfaces, while tip growth (i.e. Fe particles at the tip of the CNT) was observed for the Ta and \nTiN surfaces. Hence, the iron may also form compounds with the oxide thus being anchored on \nthe surface.  \n    \n \n CNT growth on blanket substrates: ECD versus PVD catalyst \n \n \n  Thus far we have shown that CNT density is largely affected by the conditions of catalyst \nactivation and by the underlaying substrate. Also the nature of the catalyst itself will determine \nthe density as well as growth kinetics. In general, for the same catalyst activation and growth \nconditions, the CNT growth was the fastest for Fe and the slowest for Ni, with Co in-between the \ntwo. The density (as well as growth rate) depended strongly on the amount of deposited catalyst, \nand typically less catalyst material was necessary for Fe and Co than for Ni to achieve similar \ndensities. Two methods for deposition of the catalyst have been evaluated: physical vapor \ndeposition (PVD) and electrochemical deposition (ECD). In the first case, (incomplete) thin \nfilms are deposited which are then transformed into particles by combination of thermal and \nplasma treatment. In the latter case, particles are immediately formed during the electrochemical \nnucleation and growth process: the particle density is determined by the applied potential and the \nparticle size is determined by the amount of deposited charge (corrected for the current \nefficiency) [16].   \n  \n \n   \n   \n Figure 3. Cross-sectional SEM images of CNT carpet layers deposited from Ni catalyst with \n5nm equivalent film thickness deposited with ECD ((a), (c) and (e)) and PVD ((b), (d) and (f)): \nplasma-enhanced catalyst activation in 1 Torr H2 at 200W high-frequency for 5 min + thermal \n \n growth in 1 Torr acetylene for 10 minutes at 650C ((a) and (b)), 550C ((c) and (d)) and 450C ((e) \nand (f)); the temperature for catalyst activation and growth were the same. \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  To evaluate both deposition methods CNT growth was compared for samples with same \namount of deposited catalyst material on TiN (70nm) and Ti(5nm)/TiN(70nm) substrates. Figure \n3 shows SEM images for PVD and ECD Ni catalyst samples for catalyst activation and growth at \ndifferent temperatures for the TiN substrates. In contrast to Fe catalyst, similar results were \nobtained for Ni on TiN and Ti/TiN substrates. At 650C, no significant difference between \ncatalyst deposition methods was seen: aligned growth of carpet layer of densely aligned CNT \nabout 13 to 14 um in length. At 550C, the CNT growth rate is lower resulting into 2-3 um long \nCNT carpets after 10 minutes. The ECD samples still produced aligned and dense CNT carpets. \nFor the PVD samples, the CNT density was somewhat lower, their morphology more bended \nand, moreover, large clusters were present on top of the CNT. At 450C, growth has not really \nstarted yet after 10min for the 5nm ECD sample; however a thin CNT layer was grown for 10nm \nECD Ni (not shown). For the PVD samples, a crusted layer is now clearly visible on top of the \nabout half a micron thick CNT carpet.

The agglomeration of PVD films is next to time, initial film thickness and \nambient pressure, strongly dependent on temperature [17]. SEM inspection of the samples with \nthe catalyst activation step only indeed showed clustered and connected Ni islands for the PVD \nfilms plasma treated at 550C, whereas the ECD Ni particles were similar to the as-deposited \nsamples (see also Figure 5). Since the BEOL temperature budget is limited, the room \ntemperature ECD technique has a significant industrial advantage. \n                \n \n CNT integration: selective catalyst placement and growth in via holes \n \n \n  The test structures used for integration experiments had large arrays of contact holes in \n330nm oxide dielectric landing on a 70nm TiN layer serving as a common electrode. Arrays with \nhole diameters ranging between 300nm and 150nm were available with relative pitch of 2, 3 and \n8. Figure 4 shows schematically the process flow followed for integration experiments.  \n \n \n                 \n \n Figure 4. Process flow for selective catalyst placement, CNT growth and top-contact formation \nfor test structures with via holes landing on a TiN layer which serves as common bottom \n \n electrode. For PVD deposition the catalyst particles are removed by CMP after a resist protection \nlayer is applied. For ECD the nanoparticles is deposited directly on the exposed bottom electrode \n \n without additional process steps needed. \n \n \n  Since the PVD catalyst film covers the whole wafer, the catalyst nanoparticles, formed by \ncombined thermal and plasma treatment are removed from the oxide field area by CMP. To \nprotect the catalyst nanoparticles inside the via during CMP, a protective resist layer is spin-\ncoated on top, which is removed again after the CMP step. After an additional cleaning step the \nnanoparticles are ready for CNT growth. Details of the process steps are given in [18]. Note that \nin this selective CMP approach, catalyst particles will be also present on the side walls of the via. \nThe CNT which will grow from the side-walls will not contribute the electrical conduction in \nthis case.

Note however that \nthe selective placement of the ECD catalyst is only valid in the proposed \"through-mask\" \napproach. In case of damascene liner coverage the particles will be also on the sidewalls and in \nthe field of the wafer. The advantage of ECD as low-temperature deposition technique remains \nhowever.  \n Figure 5 shows Ni nanoparticles as-deposited inside 150nm and 300nm vias with dense \nand isolated pitch. For comparison also Ni particles on blanket TiN are shown. Similar particle \ndensity and size were obtained independent of hole diameter and pitch and deposition conditions \nobtained for blanket substrates are directly transferable to patterned substrates. Due to the very \nshort deposition times (only nucleation), diffusion fields for Ni2+ ions are still small and not \naffected by its neighbors yet, which explains the absence of pattern density effects.   \n  \n \n            \n \n Figure 5.

The square pads were 50um or 100um in size and contacted \nseveral hundred vias in parallel. In all cases, Ohmic current-voltage characteristics were obtained \nfor the TiN/CNT/Ti contacts. For a quantitative measurement of the CNT via resistance, an \nelectrical test structure with Kelvin probe was used. 300nm vias in 650nm thick oxide were build \non top of M1 Cu level. Ta/TiN/Ni  was deposited with PVD and the top surface was removed by \nCMP using the selective protection procedure shown in Fig. 4 [18]. After CNT growth (thermal \ncatalyst activation + thermal growth) Ti pads were formed by PVD and lift-off for 4-point probe \nmeasurements. Contact with the bottom electrode (M1-Cu) was made through about 10,000 CNT \nvia landing on the contact pad. Two other Ti pads were connected to a Ti line crossing a single \nvia (Kelvin structure). The best measurement was obtained for 4nm Ni catalyst film with a via \nresistance of 0.1kΩ, which corresponds to about 1.2mΩ.cm when converted into an equivalent \nvia resisitivity. Y. Awano et al measured a resistance of 0.6Ω for a via with 2um in diameter and \n350nm high, which corresponds to an equivalent via resistivity of 0.6mΩ.cm [19, 20].   \n  \n \n CONCLUSIONS \n \n \n CNT interconnects at the via level could improve heat dissipation of the BEOL stack and \nas such reduce line resistance and electromigration issues, provided CNT-shell densities higher \nthan 5x1013 cm-2 can be achieved. Growth of densely aligned CNT carpets with tube density \n~1012cm-2 and shell density approaching ~1013cm-2 was demonstrated on Ti layers. Process steps \nfor selective growth of CNT into via holes with high yield and shell densities ~ 1012cm-2 were \ndeveloped. Electrical characteristics for TiN/CNT/Ti contacts were Ohmic and via resistivities \ndown to 1.2 mΩ cm were achieved. Additional work is needed to increase carbon shell density in \nvias and to implement the integration scheme to a (dual) damascene approach. Low resistance \nmetal contacts are needed to reduce contact resistance. \n \n 10 μm\n \n 1:2\n \n trench\n \n 1:3\n \n 300nm\n \n (a) (b)\n \n 10 μm\n \n 1:2\n \n trench\n \n 1:3\n \n 300nm300nm\n \n (a) (b) \n  \n \n   \n   \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n \n This work was partly supported by the EU projects CARBonCHIP (NMP4-CT-2006-\n016475) and SEA-NET Pro-Nano (IST-027982) and by METACEL project (IWT-SBO project \n060031) funded by IWT-Vlaanderen.

Optimized dispersion procedure was set up to obtain improved mechanical and electrical properties. Apparent modulus and electrical contact resistivity for CNT-epoxy composites were correlated with different dispersion solvents for CNT. CNT-epoxy composites using good dispersion solvent showed higher apparent modulus because of better stress transferring effect due to relatively uniform dispersion of CNT in epoxy and enhanced interfacial adhesion between CNT and epoxy matrix. However, good solvent showed high apparent modulus but low thermodynamic work of adhesion, Wa for single carbon microfiber/CNT-epoxy composite. It is because hydrophobic high advanced contact angle was shown in good solvent, which can not be compatible with carbon microfiber well. Damage sensing was also detected simultaneously by AE combined with electrical resistance measurement. Electrical resistivity increased stepwise with progressing fiber fracture due to the maintaining numerous electrical contact by CNT. \n (Received June 15 2008) \n (Accepted July 10 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t sensor;  \n\t microelectro-mechanical (MEMS);  \n\t electrical properties \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t \t  How to Cite This Article \n\t\t\t\t \n\t  Link to This Abstract \n\t\t \n\t  Blog This Article \n\t\t \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCopy and paste this link  Highlight all \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\thttp://dx.doi.org/10.1557/PROC-1075-J05-04\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tCitation is provided in standard text and BibTeX formats below.\n\t\t\t\t\t Highlight all \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBibTeX Format\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t@inproceedings{OPL:7990188,\nauthor = {Park,Joung-Man and Jang,Jung-Hoon and Wang,Zuojia and Kim,Pyung-Gee and Lee,Woo-Il and Park,Jong-Kyoo and DeVries,Lawrence K.},\ntitle = {Dispersive Evaluation and Self-Sensing of Single Carbon Fiber/CNT-Epoxy Composites using Electro-Micromechanical Techniques},\nbooktitle = {Symposium J \u2013 Passive and Electromechanical Materials and Integration},\nseries = {MRS Proceedings},\nvolume = {1075},\nyear = {2008},\ndoi = {10.1557/PROC-1075-J05-04},\nURL = {http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1946427400031043},\n}\n\n\t\t\t\tClick  here  for full citation export options.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBlog This Article\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\tBlog This Article\n\t\t\t\t\t:\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t Highlight all \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div style=\"background: #FFFFFF; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; padding: 0 10px 0 0; text-align: left; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 1em;\"><div style=\"font-size: 11px; padding: 0px 0px 10px 0px; font-weight:bold; color: #045989;\">Dispersive Evaluation and Self-Sensing of Single Carbon Fiber/CNT-Epoxy Composites using Electro-Micromechanical Techniques<\/div><div style=\"font-size: 11px;\"><b>Joung-Man Park,Jung-Hoon Jang,Zuojia Wang,Pyung-Gee Kim,Woo-Il Lee,Jong-Kyoo Park and Lawrence K.

The creep behaviour of the different micro-phases was also studied as function of temperature. The hardness and elastic modulus of Cu6Sn5, Cu3Sn had a weak dependence on temperature, while primary Sn, eutectic regions and electroplated Cu hardness and modulus were sensitive to temperature. Creep studies indicated that intermetallic were more creep resistant than softer phases that readily underwent creep, the type and rate of which was shown to be strongly temperature dependent. \n

X-ray diffraction shows that the Ga-doped samples have longer lattice constants and transmission electron microscopy data show that each sample consists of nanocrystallites which have agglomerated in micron-sized particles. Photoluminescence data reveal that the addition of gallium into the YAG:Ce matrix induces a red shift in the absorption spectra and a blue-shift in the emission spectra. The laser-induced fluorescent lifetime was determined as a function of temperature over the range of 0-125°C using two different emission filters. Increasing the amount of dopant ultimately results in a decrease of the fluorescent lifetime. The quenching temperatures for the Ga-doped samples were lower than the samples without gallium. The results of this work show that combustion synthesis is viable method for making highly luminescent, nanocrystalline TGPs. In addition, these results show that the quenching temperature of YAG:Ce can be altered by substituting ions which alter the location of the charge transfer state and by changing the morphology of the sample. \n (Received March 17 2008) \n (Accepted July 28 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t crystalline;  \n\t sensor;  \n\t dopant \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t \t  How to Cite This Article \n\t\t\t\t \n\t  Link to

E. \nBrown Engineering Bldg., MS 3122, College Station, TX, 77843-3122 \n \nABSTRACT \n \n \n The electromigration performance of Cu lines patterned by a Cl2 plasma-based etch \nprocess has been studied with the accelerated isothermal lifetime test. An electromigration \nactivation energy of 0.6 eV and a current density acceleration exponent of 2.7 were obtained. \nBoth the copper-silicon nitride cap layer interface and the copper grain boundary were active \ndiffusion paths. The applied mechanical bending stress changed the electromigration void \ndistribution in the film, which leaded to the shorter lifetime and lower activation energy.   \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n \n Electromigration (EM) is one of the most critical reliability issues for modern ultra large \nscale integrated (ULSI) circuits due to the aggressive decrease of interconnect dimension and the \nsubsequent very large current density [1]. Copper (Cu) interconnects are typically patterned by a \ndamascene process, using the chemical mechanical polishing method to remove the Cu film \noutside of the dielectric trench. Recently, Kuo and Lee reported a new plasma-based Cu etch \nprocess [2, 3]. Instead of vaporizing the plasma/Cu reaction product formed in Cl- or Br-based \nplasma exposure, a dilute hydrogen chloride solution was used to dissolve the reaction product of \nCuClx or CuBrx. EM studies on the damascene Cu line showed that it had a lifetime one or two \norders of magnitude longer than that of the aluminum (Al) line.[1] However, the EM \nperformance of the Cu lines patterned by the plasma-based etch process has not been explored.  \n \n The EM induced failure occurs due to the flux divergence. Microscopic divergence can \nhappen at a triple junction point of the grain-boundary network or any other location where the \ninhomogenous mass transport occurs [4]. Macroscopic divergence may occur at the bottom of \nvia for the two-level testing structure where the via or the barrier layer blocks the EM flux, or the \ninterface between Cu and the cap layer where the interfacial diffusion is the primary transport \nmechanism [5]. It is necessary to identify the diffusion path and to determine the activation \nenergy (Ea) of the EM failure process before the Cu line\u0092s reliability can be understood. \nPreviously, a wide range of Ea values were reported due to different diffusion mechanisms. For \nexample, the lattice diffusion corresponded to an Ea value of 2.1 eV and the grain boundary \ndiffusion showed an Ea value of 1.2 eV [6]. For Cu metallization, the surface or interface \ndiffusion is often the primary failure mechanism. Proost reported the Ea value of 1.06 eV for the \nCu-metal interface diffusion [7]. An Ea value between 0.6 and 0.88 eV was reported on the Cu-\ndielectric interface diffusion mechanism [8].  \n \n The EM performance depends not only on the film structure, but also the patterning \nprocess. Fillipi et al. compared the EM tests of the AlCu lines fabricated by damascene process \nand the reactive ion etching (RIE) process. The damascene lines showed a longer lifetime than \nthe RIE lines. Although both processes showed a similar value of Ea, the current density \nacceleration exponent was close to 2 for the damascene structure and close to 1 for the RIE\u0092d \nstructure [9]. Most Cu lines reported in literature were fabricated by the damascene process. In \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1079 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1079-N09-02 \n  \n \n   \n this paper, authors reported the EM performance of the Cu lines patterned by the Cl2 plasma-\nbased etch process.  \n \nEXPERIMENTAL \n \n \n Single level test lines were prepared on the multilayer Cu (800 nm)/Ta (10 nm)/SiNx/Si \nfilm, using a Cl2 plasma-based etch process. The Ta layer was used as a diffusion barrier for the \nCu film. The EM line was 800 um long and 7 um wide resembling NIST straight line with 4 \nKelvin contact pads. The Cu film was patterned the photoresist, followed by a Cl2-based plasma \netch process. The detailed Cu film etch process was described in [2]. A silicon nitride layer was \ndeposited by a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process at 300°C to cover \nthe patterned Cu lines and prevent Cu oxidation during the EM tests. The silicon nitride layer at \nthe probe contact pad area was etched off with a dilute buffered oxide etch solution. \n \n The EM test system was built around a probe station (Signatone s-1160) with a hot chuck \nwith the temperature control capability. The isothermal EM test was conducted with a feedback \ncontrol loop that adjusted the current to the Cu line so that the effective temperature of the test \nline was kept within a narrow error band of the test temperature, Ttest. The algorithm followed the \nprinciples of JESD61. The temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), obtained prior to the EM \ntest, was used to estimate the temperature of the test line. The current was applied from a \nprogrammable power source and the voltage drop along the test line was measured by a digital \nmultimeter. The EM test stopped when the resistance increased more than 5%. The Cu line after \nEM was pictured with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Planar views were obtained after \nthe passivation SiNx cap layer was removed by a dilute HF solution. The SEM observations \nprovided qualitative information on the microstructure of the tested lines. \n  \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS \n \nStatistical EM Performance \n \n The activation energy ( aE ) and the current density acceleration factor ( n ) are usually \nexpressed by the Black equation.  \n \n  )exp(\nkT\n \n E\n \n J\n \n A\nMTTF a\n \n n\n=       (1) \n \n where MTTF, J, and k are median time to failure, current density and Boltzmann\u0092s constant, \nrespectively. A  is a normalization time depending on the geometry and microstructure of the test \nline. From equation (1), we obtain  \n kTEJnAMTTF a /)ln()ln()ln( +−=    (2) \nThe value of n  can be obtained by the linear regression of ln(MTTF) vs. ln(J) at the same test \ntemperature. The value of aE  can be obtained by the linear regression of [ln(MTTF)+nln(J)] vs. \n \n 1/kT once the value of n is known. \nSince the temperature and the current density were coupled in the isothermal EM test, the \n \n EM tests could be conducted at the same Cu temperature of 350ºC but different chuck \ntemperatures, e.g., 20ºC, 46ºC, and 74ºC, respectively. In such cases, the current density varied \nfor the same Ttest. The n value of 2.7 was obtained. It is generally considered that the n value \nshould lie between 1 and 2. For void-growth limited failure, the n value was reported to be close \nto 1 while for nucleation limited failure it should be close to 2 [1]. For an n value greater than 2,  \n  \n \n   \n it may exist a thermal gradient during the EM test. For the Cu lines in this test, the SEM \nobservations showed that the voids were randomly distributed along the length. However, during \nvoid growth, the temperature increases locally in the vicinity of the void. From the Black \nequation, the underestimated temperature leads to an overestimation of the n value. Similarly, the \nn value increased with the current density due to the increase of Joule heating [10]. Therefore, \nthe isothermal EM here resulted in a larger n value than the conventional EM test. \n \n Figure 1 shows the cumulative failure distribution of Cu lines at the test temperatures \nfrom 320°C to 380°C. The times to failure (TTF) follow a log-normal distribution with the \nstandard deviation σ  between 0.19 and 0.30. Although these σ  values are larger than those \nobtained from two-level test structure [11], they are comparable to the value obtained from the \nsingle level damascene test lines [12]. For the two-level structures, failure occurs in or adjacent \nto vias which are the weakest regions. For the single level structure, failure is more sensitive to \nCu film microstructure and interface. The value of σ  becomes large when more than one failure \nmechanisms exist in the test structure.  \n \n ATTF (s)\n103 104 105\n \n %\n F\n \n ai\nlu\n \n re\n \n 1.0\n \n 10.0\n \n 30.0\n \n 50.0\n \n 70.0\n \n 90.0\n \n 99.0\n \n 15.8\n16\n \n 16.2\n16.4\n16.6\n16.8\n \n 17\n17.2\n \n 17.5 18 18.5 19 19.5 20\n \n 1/kT\n \n ln\n(M\n \n T\nT\n \n F\n)+\n \n n*\nln\n \n (J\n)\n \n Ea = 0.60 eV\n \n Ttest= 320ºC\nσ = 0.19\n \n Ttest= 350ºC\nσ = 0.30\n \n Ttest= 380ºC\nσ = 0.28\n \n ATTF (s)\n103 104 105\n \n %\n F\n \n ai\nlu\n \n re\n \n 1.0\n \n 10.0\n \n 30.0\n \n 50.0\n \n 70.0\n \n 90.0\n \n 99.0\n \n 15.8\n16\n \n 16.2\n16.4\n16.6\n16.8\n \n 17\n17.2\n \n 17.5 18 18.5 19 19.5 20\n \n 1/kT\n \n ln\n(M\n \n T\nT\n \n F\n)+\n \n n*\nln\n \n (J\n)\n \n Ea = 0.60 eV\n \n Ttest= 320ºC\nσ = 0.19\n \n Ttest= 350ºC\nσ = 0.30\n \n Ttest= 380ºC\nσ = 0.28\n \n  \nFigure 1. Cumulative failure distribution of Cu lines.

The aE value of 0.6 eV was obtained. There are four possible diffusion paths in the Cu \n \n structure: lattice, grain boundary, Cu/Ta interface, and Cu/SiNx interface. As discussed in the \nIntroduction section, the lattice and the grain boundary diffusion generally show a high aE  \n \n value, i.e., larger than 1.2 eV. The Cu-barrier metal interface diffusion shows a higher aE value \nthan that of the Cu-dielectric interface diffusion because the former has a stronger adhesion force \nthan the latter. The strength of adhesion affects the void nucleation and growth rate induced by \nEM. The PECVD SiNx cap layer usually adheres weakly to the Cu layer. In addition, the large \ndifference of the thermal expansion coefficients between Cu and the dielectric film weakens the \ninterface in the EM test at high temperature [13]. Ea value of 0.65 eV was reported for Cu line \nwith PECVD SiNx cap layer [14]. The aE  value of 0.6 eV in this study indicated the Cu-SiNx \ncap layer interfacial diffusion may be the primary transport mechanism. \n \nFailure analysis \n \n It is well established that the basic requirement for EM to occur in an interconnect  \n  \n \n   \n structure is the existence of flux divergence of metal atoms due to the electronic driving force.  \nThe atomic flux Γ at i-grain boundary can be expressed as follow. \n \n i\ni\n \n ii\ni qEZkT\n \n DN φcos*=Γ      (3) \n \n where N, D, qZ *  are the atomic concentration, diffusion coefficient, and effective charge of the \n \n ions, iφ  is the inclination angle of the i-th grain boundary with respect to the electron flow. The \nflux divergence at a triple junction point is ∑Γi , which is zero only when the relative angle \nbetween two adjacent grain boundaries is 120° [15]. However, due to the variation of the grain \nsize, this particular condition is hardly met. A non-zero divergence at the triple junction point \nleads to an accumulation or void. As illustrated in Figure 2(a), if 321 Γ+Γ<Γ , the void is formed \nby the divergent flux along the grain boundaries. In such a case, the void at the early stage should \nhave a triangle shape. Fig. 2(b) and (c) show the typical voids formed on the Cu line after EM at \n350°C for 150 and 350 seconds, respectively. The voids were not due to the removal of the \npassivation layer, because no similar voids on the adjacent dummy lines were observed. \nAlthough Fig. 2(b) and (c) were from different lines, the voids presented at the similar location, \ni.e., the triple junction point of grain boundaries. Therefore, the void initiated from the grain \nboundary junction point and grew larger as the EM continued.  \n \n \n  \nFigure 2. Illustration (a) and SEM images of void formation after EM at 350ºC for (b) 150 \nseconds; (c)350 seconds. \n \n \n Mass transport occurs not only along the grain boundary, but also along the interface. Cu \natoms that are migrating along the upper Cu surface or Cu/dielectric interface are fed by two \nmechanisms: the Cu diffusion from inside of the metal line to the top surface along the grain \nboundaries or the grain thinning, as illustrated in Fig. 3(a). When the Cu atoms are depleted from \nthe grain boundary or the inner free surface of the void that intersects the top Cu surface, the \nvoid tends to grow in a \u0093v\u0094 shape. In such a case, the void grows wider and deeper with EM \ntime. For grain thinning, the surface atoms on the upstream grain diffuse to the void boundary, \nand then move up the step to feed the atoms that flow at the Cu/dielectric interface [4]. In this \ncase the void leads to the flat upstream surface. Fig. 3(b) shows the top view of the Cu line after \nEM at 350°C for 2400 seconds and the removal of SiNx. The recess areas in Fig. 3(b) correspond \nto the voids at the Cu-SiNx interface, which were due to the interfacial diffusion. Both grain \nboundary depletion voids and grain thinning voids were observed. The voids caused by grain \nthinning should have less impact on the line resistance change than the voids caused by grain \nboundary depletion because the lower-stream grains are still connected in the former situation. \nHowever, since both kinds of voids exist at the same time, it is hard to differentiate them from \nthe resistance-time plot.  \n \n   \n  \n \n   \n Cu\n \n void\n \n Grain thinning\n \n Top surface/ interface\n \n 2 um\n \n (a)\n \n (b)\n \n Cu\n \n void\n \n Grain thinning\n \n Top surface/ interface\n \n Cu\n \n void\n \n Grain thinning\n \n Top surface/ interface\n \n 2 um\n \n (a)\n \n (b)\n \n Grain thinning\n \n Grain boundary depletion\n \n  \nFigure 3. Illustration and SEM image of voids by grain thinning and grain boundary depletion\n \n  \nExternal bending stress effect on EM \n \n To investigate the mechanical stress effect on EM, a series of EM tests were performed \non the mechanically bended Cu lines. The patterned Cu sample was cut into a 2 x 2 cm plate, \nwhich was placed on the three-point bending Al holder on the hot chuck. The stress was caused \nby the mechanical bending and could be roughly estimated. Here, it is bout 85MPa, which is far \nmore than the internal stress without mechanical bending. The MTTFs of the bended lines are \nshorter than those of the non-bended lines at 320ºC and 350ºC, i.e., 8852s and 4944s vs. 11711s \nand 6000s, respectively. At 380ºC, the MTTFs of the bended and non-bended lines are \ncomparable, i.e., 3320s vs. 3278, because the initial bending stress effect is less significant due to \nthe increased thermal stress. Using n= 2.7, the Ea value of 0.5 eV was obtained, which is smaller \nthan the Ea without bending stress, i.e., 0.6 eV. Similar activation energy shift was reported on \nCu damascene lines with compressive stress being applied [16]. In the EM test, the resistance \nchange is a complex collective behavior of the void growth and nucleation. After EM test, \nnumerous voids were observed along the length. There is noticeable difference in the voids \ndistribution between the bended and non-bended lines. For example, in the non-bended line, the \nconsecutive voids tended to line up along the current flow, as shown in Figure 4 (a). However, in \nthe bended lines, the consecutive voids tended to line up perpendicular to the current flow, as \nshown in Fig. 4(b). \n \n   \n \n  \nFigure 4. Typical void distribution in (a) non-bended line, (b) bended line of EM at 350ºC.  \n \nIn a simplified mode, assuming the total volume of the voids are comparable for the bended and \nnon-bended lines, the resistance change in a conductor of overall length L and width W is given \nby the following equation:  \n \n  \n \n )1\n)(\n \n (\n)(\n \n 0\n \n −\n−\n \n ×=∆\ntwW\n \n W\n \n L\n \n tl\n \n R\n \n R\n    (4) \n \n at 350ºC.  \n  \n \n   \n )(tl  and )(tw are equivalent overall void length and width, respectively. From equation (4), the \nvoids aligned perpendicular to the current flow play a larger impact on the resistance change than \nthe equaxied voids do. Therefore, the line with the void distribution in Fig. 4(b) would have a \nshorter lifetime. Although equation (4) was based on a simplified model, more detail study and \nsimulation on the void morphology showed the similar result [17]. Therefore, the applied \nbending stress affected the void distribution and shortened the EM lifetime.  \n \n  \nCONCLUSION \n \n The isothermal electromigration tests were performed on the single level Cu interconnect \nlines prepared from a Cl2 plasma based etch process. An activation energy of 0.6 eV and a \ncurrent density exponent of 2.7 were obtained. The SEM pictures showed that voids were \ninitiated from the grain boundary junction points and grew preferentially along grain boundaries. \nBoth the Cu-SiNx interface and the Cu grain boundary diffusion were critical to the EM failure. \nThe Cu lines with the bended compressive stress showed a shorter lifetime and lower activation \nenergy than the unbended lines due to the change of void distribution.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \n \n The authors would like to thank Helinda Nominanda for the SiNx cap layer deposition \nand Yu Lei for the technical discussion during the photolithography mask design.  \n \n \n REFERENCES: \n[1] C.

It is shown that the most probable mechanism of SiOCH modification in He plasma is removal of hydrogen atoms from CH3 groups. The change of Si\u2013O\u2013Si bond angles depends on the amount of the formed \u2013CH2* (CHx) groups. During the followed exposure in NH3 plasma, NH2* radicals bind CHx groups with Si forming a \u2013CH2\u2013 Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2013 chain. The end of this chain gets bound to its beginning through NH2. This process is the reason of pore sealing. \n (Received September 03 2008) \n (Accepted October 09 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t dielectric;  \n\t plasma deposition;  \n\t infrared (IR) spectroscopy \n

However, D.C. characterization techniques might not reflect the actual reliability of interconnects that are carrying pulsed D.C. or A.C. (alternating current) signals during operation. This study investigates the effects of unipolar and bipolar pulsed current on the electromigration lifetime of copper (Cu) interconnects. A series of long period pulsed current (i.e. 2, 16, 32 and 48 hours) were applied to Cu interconnects. Lifetime enhancement is observed when the half-period of pulsed current is shorter than the medium-time-to-failure (t50) of D.C. stressed samples. Minor increase in resistance occurring in-between pulses for unipolar pulsed current stressed samples, and occurrence of damage healing in bipolar pulsed current stressed samples are reasons attributed for the observed enhanced lifetime. We obtained longer MTF when the period of the pulsed current is shorter. \n (Received March 18 2008) \n (Accepted April 29 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t electromigration;  \n\t Cu;  \n\t microelectronics

This technique was called \u201cself-formation of the diffusion barrier,\u201d which is attractive for fabrication of ultra-large scale integrated (ULSI) interconnects. In the present study, we investigated the applicability of this technique to Cu(Ti) alloy films which were deposited on the four low dielectric constant (low-k) dielectric layers which are potential dielectric layers of future ULSI-Si devices. The microstructures were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and correlated with the electrical properties of the Cu(Ti) films. It was concluded that the Ti-rich interface layers were formed in all the Cu(Ti)/dielectric-layer samples. The primary factor to control composition of the self-formed Ti-rich interface layers was the C concentration in the dielectric layers rather than the formation enthalpy of the Ti compounds (TiC and TiSi). Crystalline TiC was formed on the dielectric layers with a C concentration higher than 17 at.%. \n (Received May 01 2008) \n (Accepted May 01 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t barrier layer;  \n\t annealing;

The thickness of the Mn oxide layer could be \nvaried 2.6 to 10 nm depending on deposition temperature. Heat-treated samples of PVD Cu / \nCVD Mn oxide /SiO2 indicated no interdiffusion. The CVD Mn oxide was found to be a good \ndiffusion barrier layer. \n \nIntroduction \n With the increase in packing density of ultra-large scale integrated circuits, geometrical \ndimensions continue to decrease. As a width of Cu line becomes narrow, a thickness of a barrier \nlayer should be reduced to prevent the increase of the effective resistivity of the interconnect \nlines [1]. Ta and TaN have been widely used as conventional barrier materials to prevent \ninterdiffusion between Cu line and dielectric insulating layer. Physical vapor deposition (PVD) \nhave been employed as a their deposition method. The barrier layer formation with a PVD \ntechnique has become difficult as the technology node is reduced to 45 nm \n \n Without using Ta and TaN, Koike and his colleagues reported the self-formation of a diffusion \nbarrier by direct deposition of a Cu-Mn seed layer on a TEOS oxide substrate. The Mn oxide \nlayer was self-formed at the interface by annealing at elevated temperatures and acted as an \nexcellent barrier layer [2-4]. However, as in the case of the conventional Ta barrier, PVD \ndeposition of the Cu-Mn seed layer will eventually encounter the difficulty in deposition in \nnarrow trenches and vias. \n \n Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been known for its good step coverage, and is a \ncandidate technique for the formation of a barrier layer, a Cu seed layer and entire Cu line. In \norder to take advantage of the excellent reliability of Mn oxide, Mn deposition with CVD as a \nbarrier layer is expected to be very attractive process. Up to date, only a few works have been \nreported for CVD-Mn layer. Wen-bin et al. reported that the deposition of a metallic Mn layer \noccurs above the temperature of 410ºC [5]. Maruyama and Osaki reported that a Mn oxide layer \nforms above 250ºC [6]. However, it is desirable to form the Mn barrier layer with CVD at lower \ntemperatures. \n \n In this work, as a first approach of Manganese-based barrier layer formation by CVD, we \ndeposited Mn oxide films using a metal organic precursor by thermal CVD at low temperatures \nand investigated the formation behavior and diffusion barrier property of the Mn oxide films. \n \n \n Experimental procedures \nSubstrates were p-type Si wafers having a plasma TEOS oxides of 100nm in thickness. \n \n Bisethylcylopentadienyl manganese (EtCp)2Mn was used as a metal organic manganese \nprecursor. The Mn precursor was vaporized and introduced into the hot- wall reaction chamber \nwith Ar or H2 carrier gas in the thermal-CVD process. The detailed process \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1079 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1079-N03-11 \n  \n \n   \n  parameter is shown in Table I. Following the Mn CVD, the sample was transferred to a \n PVD chamber with keeping vacuum to deposit a Cu overlayer using a DC sputtering system. \nTwo types of the samples were prepared in this study.

A thin \ncontinuous layer is observed at the interface between Cu and SiO2 layer. The CVD-Mn layer \ndoes not show a characteristic diffraction contrast of a crystalline structure. Therefore, the CVD-\nMn layer is considered to be an amorphous structure. The CVD-Mn layer has a thickness of 3.9 \nnm. The EDX result of Fig.1 indicates that Cu, Mn, Si, O and C are detected from the CVD-Mn \nlayer. Among these elements, Cu and Si peaks are originated from the neighboring layers of Cu \nand SiO2. This is because a nominal electron beam size used for TEM-EDX analysis was 2 nm \nand is nearly the same size as the thickness of the CVD-Mn layer. Beam spread within the \nsample had lead to the overlap of the Cu and Si peaks. Thus, the CVD-Mn layer is consisted \nmainly of Mn, O and C. \n \n  \n \n     \n \nFigure 1.

The peak position indicates that the \nCVD-Mn layer is not metallic states but in oxide states. This result is in agreement with the \nresults of TEM and EDX.

It is \nalso found that the thickness is slightly thinner with H2 carrier gas than with Ar carrier gas. It \nshould be noted that the thickness of the Mn oxide layer is in the range of 2.6 nm to 10 nm, \nincluding the thickness values required in the ITRS road map. \n \n  \nFigure 4.

Extracted diffusion coefficients for \nthe bulk were in line with literature values.  In order to simulate the experimentally derived \ndiffusion profiles at temperatures where bulk diffusion is not the dominant diffusion mechanism \n(room temperature to 350 °C), it was necessary to explicitly include the re-distribution of Al as a \nresult of Cu grain growth during anneal.  Aluminum has the tendency to segregate to the Cu/liner \nand Cu/etch stop (ES) interface.  The tendency of Al to segregate to the liner is ten times \nstronger for ruthenium (Ru) than for tantalum (Ta).  In 100 nm wide dual damascene structures \nlined with Ru, this segregation behavior was responsible for the Al depletion in bulk Cu and for \nthe Al depletion at the Cu/ES interface. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n \n To meet the increasing feature-density requirements of future technology nodes, the \ndimensions of copper (Cu) dual damascene interconnects must be continuously scaled.  Since the \ncurrent density increases with shrinking feature size, Cu lines become more and more prone to \nelectromigration-induced failure.  The electromigration resistance of Cu can be improved \nthrough doping with elements such as Ag, Sn, and Al [1-3].  Relatively little is known about the \nfundamental diffusion properties of these dopants in polycrystalline Cu thin films and about the \ndopant distribution in Cu dual damascene structures.  In the present study, we report on the \ndiffusion mechanism of aluminum (Al) in Cu thin films.  To understand the experimentally \nderived Al diffusion profile in terms of grain boundary diffusion, bulk lattice diffusion and grain \nsize evolution during anneal, secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) depth profiles of Al-\ndoped Cu thin films were complemented with continuum simulations.  Aluminum segregation to \nthe Cu/ES interface and to two technologically relevant liner materials, tantalum/tantalum nitride \n(Ta(N)) and tantalum nitride/ruthenium (TaN/Ru), were first investigated for simple planar \nstacks.  The results are then compared with the spatial distribution of Al in Cu-filled trenches. \n \n \n EXPERIMENT \n \n All samples were fabricated in state-of-the-art 300 mm barrier/seed deposition tools with \nintegrated degas and pre-clean capability, an electroplating tool and a CVD etch stop deposition \ntool.  Figure 1 (a) shows the blanket wafer film stack used in this study.  The bottom interface \nconsisted of a PVD Ta(N) based barrier or a TaN/Ru bi-layer, respectively.   \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1079 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1079-N04-06 \n  \n \n   \n A 200 Å thick PVD Cu-Al layer was sandwiched between two 1000 Å thick PVD Cu layers.  \nThe total Al dose in the stack was on the order of 7x1015 atoms/cm2.  Symmetrical diffusion \nstacks were capped either with a Ta or Ru cap, whereas non-symmetrical stacks were capped \nwith a silicon carbide/nitride ES layer.  Annealing experiments as a function of time were \nconducted in forming gas in a vertical diffusion furnace that was kept at the desired anneal \ntemperature.  Samples were introduced through a load lock.  Figure 1 (b) shows a schematic of \nthe corresponding dual damascene structures.  Dual damascene structures were prepared using \nstandard PVD Ta(N) barrier and seed deposition, and were subsequently plated with a state-of-\nthe-art EP Cu process, chemically-mechanically polished and capped with a silicon \ncarbide/nitride etch stop layer. \n \n Si\n \n SiO2\n \n X = Ta(N) or TaN/Ru\n \n PVD Cu\n \n PVD Cu-Al\n \n X = Ta(N), Ru or ES\n \n ES\n \n (a) (b)\n \n PVD Cu\n \n Cu-Al\n \n X = Ta(N) or TaN/Ru\n \n Inter Layer Dielectric\n \n Si\n \n SiO2\n \n X = Ta(N) or TaN/Ru\n \n PVD Cu\n \n PVD Cu-Al\n \n X = Ta(N), Ru or ES\n \n ES\n \n (a) (b)\n \n PVD Cu\n \n Cu-Al\n \n X = Ta(N) or TaN/Ru\n \n Inter Layer Dielectric\n \n  \nFigure 1.

(b) Dual damascene structures \ndoped with Al. \n \n \n SIMS measurements were done with a SC-Ultra SIMS instrument.  A 1.5KeV Cs+ \nprimary beam was used and positive secondary cluster ions (Cs+, Cs16O+, CsAl+ and Cs63Cu+) \nwith an energy of 5keV were collected at low mass resolution (~300) [4].  For SIMS on \npatterned structures, large 1 x 0.5 mm test fields were used that consisted of 100 nm wide Al-\ndoped Cu trenches of uniform pitch, width and orientation.  Additionally, the Al concentration in \nCu lines was measured with a field emission gun transmission electron microscope equipped \nwith a detector for energy dispersive X-ray analysis (FE TEM/EDX). The spatial resolution is \napprox. 1nm and approx. 1% Al can be detected within the analyzed volume. \n \nDISCUSSION \n \n The evolution of Al depth profiles with time of symmetrical stacks with a Ta cap is \nshown in Fig. 2 for several characteristic temperatures 20°C, 150°C, 350°C and 450°C.  At \n450°C, Fig 2 (a), the Al source layer broadens symmetrically.  When the anneal temperature is \nlowered to 350°C, Fig. 2 (b), little broadening of the source layer is observed, however, diffusion \ntails develop and saturate after approximately 5 minutes.  At 250 °C (results are not shown) \nsaturated diffusion tails form after 20 minutes of anneal, whereas at 150°C (Fig 2(c)) even after \n80 minutes of anneal no saturation of the diffusion tails is reached.  The concentration of the  \n  \n \n   \n saturated tails is essentially independent of the anneal temperature and at saturation about half of \nthe total Al dose is contained in the tail plateaus.  Even at room temperature, Fig 2 (d), the Al \nsource layer is far from being stable.  Significant formation of diffusion tails is observed after 2 \nmonths.  At all temperatures, Al segregation to the Ta liner material takes place.  While the \nsegregation of Al to the Ta liner (bottom) and Ta cap (top) is symmetrical for low anneal \ntemperatures, the extent of segregation becomes increasingly asymmetrical when the anneal \ntemperature is raised with more Al segregating to the top Ta interface than to the bottom Ta \ninterface, see Fig 2 (a) - (d).  The asymmetry of the Al segregation is not completely understood \nat this point. \n \n \n 1E+16\n \n 1E+17\n \n 1E+18\n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\nDepth (A)\n \n co\nn\n \n c.\n (\n \n at\n/c\n \n m\n3 )\n \n 450C\n5min\n \n 20min\n \n 80min\n \n 0min\n \n 1E+16\n \n 1E+17\n \n 1E+18\n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\nDepth (A)\n \n co\nn\n \n c.\n (\n \n at\n/c\n \n m\n3 )\n \n 450C\n5min\n \n 20min\n \n 80min\n \n 0min\n \n 1E+16\n \n 1E+17\n \n 1E+18\n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\nDepth (A)\n \n co\nn\n \n c.\n (\n \n at\n/c\n \n m\n3 )\n \n 350C\n \n 5min\n20min\n \n 80min\n \n 0min\n \n 1E+16\n \n 1E+17\n \n 1E+18\n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\nDepth (A)\n \n co\nn\n \n c.\n (\n \n at\n/c\n \n m\n3 )\n \n 350C\n \n 5min\n20min\n \n 80min\n \n 0min\n \n 1E+16\n \n 1E+17\n \n 1E+18\n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n \n Depth (A)\n \n co\nn\n \n c.\n (\n \n at\n/c\n \n m\n3 )\n \n 150C\n \n 5min\n20min\n \n 80min\n \n 0min\n \n 1E+16\n \n 1E+17\n \n 1E+18\n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n \n Depth (A)\n \n co\nn\n \n c.\n (\n \n at\n/c\n \n m\n3 )\n \n + 2 months\n \n as deposited\n \n + 4 months\n \n (a) (b)\n \n (c) (d)\n \n  \n \n Figure 2.

(d) PVD Cu stack at room temperature as deposited and after 2 & 4 \nmonths of ageing. \n \n \n To understand the re-distribution of Al from a source layer as a function of temperature \nand time, continuum simulations were employed that treat Al diffusion as transport inside grains \n(bulk diffusion) and along grain boundaries [5].  Values for the bulk and grain boundary \ndiffusivities were taken from the literature [6-7].  Rapidly saturating grain growth during anneal \nwas taken into account by including an empirical rate constant in the simulation.  This rate \nconstant was treated as a single exponential growth process with a characteristic time constant.  \n  \n \n   \n Simulated Al diffusion profiles at 350°C are shown in Figure 3. Since grain boundary \ndiffusivity is orders of magnitude greater than bulk diffusivity [6-7] and grain boundary volume \nincreases with decreasing grain size, the redistribution of Al is facilitated by small grain sizes.  \nFor a somewhat unrealistically small grain size of 50 Å, Fig. 3 (a), simulations predict, that the \nsource layer diminishes quickly with time.  Due to the small Cu grain size, the average diffusion \npath that Al experiences before it encounters a grain boundary is short and dopants are thus \nquickly transported away by high-diffusivity grain boundaries.  A film with grain size of 5000 Å, \nwhich is on the same order of magnitude as the total film thickness used in this report, exhibits \nno saturation of the tail concentration and little loss of Al from the source layer is observed, see \nFig 3(b).  Although the diffusion along grain boundaries is still very rapid, the process is limited \nby the long diffusion path of Al inside the Cu bulk.  Only when the grain size is allowed to \nevolve from a smaller grain size to 5000 Å in the early stages of the simulated anneal, does the \nsimulation model fit the experimental data, see Fig. 3(c).   \n \n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0.0 0.3 0.5\n \n Depth (µm)\n \n C\no\n \n n\nc.\n \n  (a\nt/c\n \n m\n3 )\n \n 1E+18\n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0 0.25 0.5\n \n Depth(µm)\n \n C\no\n \n n\nc.\n \n  (\nat\n \n /c\nm\n \n 3 )\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0.0 0.3 0.5\n \n Depth(µm)\n \n C\no\n \n n\nc.\n \n (a\nt/\n \n cm\n3 )\n \n (a) (b)\n \n (c) (d)\n \n 5 min\n \n 20 min\n \n 80 min\n \n 20 min\n \n 80 min\n \n 5 min\n \n 5 min\n \n 20 min\n \n 80 min\n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0.0 0.3 0.5\n \n Depth (µm)\n \n C\no\n \n n\nc.\n \n  (a\nt/c\n \n m\n3 )\n \n 1E+18\n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0 0.25 0.5\n \n Depth(µm)\n \n C\no\n \n n\nc.\n \n  (\nat\n \n /c\nm\n \n 3 )\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0.0 0.3 0.5\n \n Depth(µm)\n \n C\no\n \n n\nc.\n \n (a\nt/\n \n cm\n3 )\n \n (a) (b)\n \n (c) (d)\n \n 5 min\n \n 20 min\n \n 80 min\n \n 20 min\n \n 80 min\n \n 5 min\n \n 5 min\n \n 20 min\n \n 80 min\n \n  \nFigure 3.

The grain size is on the order of 5000 Å.  White dots are Al. \n \n   \n  \n \n   \n As Cu grains in the highly unstable as-deposited film grow, grain boundaries move \nthrough the Al-doped regions thus providing an effective path by which Al is captured inside the \ngrain boundaries.  The time needed to stabilize the grain size is represented by the time needed to \nreach saturation of the diffusion tails and this time decreases with temperature.  Since Cu grain-\ngrowth at room temperature is a well known phenomenon [8], grain-growth induced re-\ndistribution of Al at temperatures as low as room temperature is expected and was indeed \nobserved, see Fig 2 (d).  An Auger scan of a polycrystalline, Al-doped Cu thin film confirms the \ngrain size is on the order of the film thickness and that more Al resides within the grains \nboundaries than in the Cu bulk, see Figure 3 (d). \n \n The bulk diffusivity was determined by fitting the experimentally observed broadening of \nthe Al source layer for 5 - 80 min of anneal.  The bulk diffusivity values obtained for 450 °C and \n350 °C were 1.8x10-15 cm2/sec and 6.3x10-17 cm2/sec, respectively. These values are in excellent \nagreement with the literature [6-7].  For 250 °C the extraction of diffusivity is complicated due to \nthe limited broadening of the source layer and roughness-induced peak broadening during SIMS \ndepth profiling.  Since the Cu films in this report are thin and the barrier layer serves as a sink for \nAl, grain boundary diffusivities could not be extracted from the gradient of the diffusion tails. \n \n  \n \n 1E+17\n \n 1E+18\n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 1000 2000 3000 4000\nDepth (A)\n \n C\no\n \n n\nce\n \n n\ntr\n \n at\nio\n \n n\n (\n \n at\n/c\n \n m\n3)\n \n TaN/Ru\n \n PVD Ta(N)\n \n 0E+00\n \n 5E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 2E+20\n \n 2E+20\n \n 3E+20\n \n 320 370 420 470\n \n Depth (A)\n \n C\no\n \n n\nc.\n \n  (\nat\n \n /c\nm\n \n 3 )\n \n PVD Ta(N)\n \n TaN/Ru\n \n (a) (b)\n \n  \n \n Figure 4. (a) Planar stack capped with ES material. According to SIMS depth profiling the Al \nsegregation to the Cu/Ru interface is an order of magnitude larger than the segregation at \nCu/Ta(N) interface. (b) Al concentration at the Cu/ES interface for a large assembly of patterned \ntrenches as measured by SIMS.  \n \n \n Diffusion profiles are further influenced by the presence of the interface material.  For a \nnon-symmetrical PVD Cu stack capped with ES material, Fig. 4 (a) depicts the segregation of Al \nto a Ta(N)-based liner material and a Ru/TaN based liner material, respectively.  For identical \nanneal conditions, we find that a stack with a Ru liner accumulates approximately two times \nmore Al during doping than the Ta(N)-based stack.  For Ru, most of the Al segregates to the \nCu/Ru interface and the Al dose is ~10 times higher than that measured at the Cu/Ta(N) \ninterface.  In Fig 4 (a), the Al conc. at depth of 1000 A represents the bulk concentration of Al in \nthe particular stack.. The bulk concentration in the Ta(N) stack is about 5 times larger than the Al \nbulk concentration in the Ru/TaN stack.  For planar stacks both liner materials exhibited similar \namounts of Al at the Cu/ES interface.  \n  \n \n   \n In order to understand the distribution of Al in real interconnect structures in the light of \nthis segregation behavior, dynamic SIMS measurements were conducted on dual damascene \nstructure which are depicted in Fig 1. (b). The diffusion profiles consist of an Al peak at the ES \ninterface that quickly reaches a plateau as the sputter front moves away from the Cu/ES interface \nand into the trench.  At the Cu/ES interface, SIMS detects the convoluted amount of Al at ES/Cu \ninterface, Al residing in the bulk of the Cu lines and Al that has segregated to the sidewalls.  \nInside the metal trench, only Al in the bulk and Al residing at the sidewalls are detected.  The Al \nconcentration at the Cu/ES interface can thus be determined by subtracting the Al plateau region \n(Al in the bulk + Al residing at the sidewalls) from the Al depth profile, the result of which is \nshown in Fig. 4 (b).  As a result of the strong segregation tendency of Al to the Ru sidewalls, see \nplanar stack results in Fig. 4 (a), the Al concentration at Cu/ES interface is strongly depleted with \nrespect to Al, while a healthy dose of Al is retained at the Cu/ES layer of trenches lined with \nTa(N).  These results have been independently confirmed by FE TEM/EDX line scans which \ndetect within the accuracy of the measurement technique no Al at the Cu/ES interface but Al \nsegregation to the Ru sidewalls.  The data supports the model that the main pathway for Al to \nreach the ES/Cu interface is Al diffusion across the Cu/liner interface. Al atoms are more mobile \nacross Cu/Ta(N) interface than Cu/Ru interface. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \n \n This report for the first time presents a model of Al diffusion in Cu thin films with \nexplicit consideration of Cu grain growth during anneal and the segregation tendency of Al to the \nCu/liner interface that is consistent with experimentally derived diffusion profiles.  Simple planar \nstacks were used to predict the distribution of Al in dual damascene structures. \n \n \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n \n The authors acknowledge Patrick Paluda for fab integration support of the experiments \ndescribed in this report, Gregory Scott & Janet Forsyth for their support of the SIMS \nmeasurements, and Milt Jaehnig & John Richards for help with Auger spectroscopy. \n \nREFERENCES \n \n \n 1.

The Ag nanoparticles employed where synthesized with various organic molecules and procedures to produce particles with a range of capping thicknesses and decomposition temperatures (Td), as measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). A baseline sample containing commercially available un-capped micrometer scale Ag was also investigated for comparison. Results indicate that all of the Sn initially present formed a liquid phase when heated through its melting point when combined with Ag particles exhibiting a comparatively thick cap of low Td. Slightly smaller fractions of Sn liquid were obtained when the Ag's cap was thin and of a high Td while particles with thin-low Td caps exhibited the highest levels of Sn consumption and similar to that observed with the un-capped micron-scale Ag particles. The reduction in the amount of Sn liquid formed is attributed to solid state reaction between the Ag and Sn particles resulting in the formation of a more refractory phase. The extent of the subsequent liquid phase reaction was also evaluated and is demonstrated to not necessarily be adversely effected by the presence of the organics. The significance of this work is the demonstration that organic molecules may be employed to prevent solid state reaction in particle compacts at elevated temperatures, yet allow the subsequent liquid phase reaction proceed uninhibited. \n (Received April 30 2008) \n (Accepted May 01 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t differential thermal analysis (DTA);  \n\t bonding;  \n\t powder processing \n

By plasma-polymerization (PP) \nprocess using ring-type siloxane precursor, a new self-organized porous SiOCH film is \ndeveloped with preserving the original hexagonal silica-backbone, so called as a molecular-pore-\nstack (MPS) SiOCH film.  The hydrocarbon-rich MPS film has high endurance to the process \ndamages.  A density-modulated MPS film with low-k cap is obtained with reinforced interfaces \nby plasma co-polymerization (PcP) process in the one-step deposition scheme using the ring-type \nand a linear-type siloxane, applicable for 32nm-nodes and beyond at a low manufacturing cost. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n \n To reduce the parasitic capacitance in scaled-down ULSI interconnects [1], a low-k \ndielectric film of SiOCH with k~3 had been introduced in 90nm-nodes.  For further scaling, \nporous low-k films have been implemented into 65nm-nodes ULSIs [9, 10] as shown in Fig. 1. \nThe porous low-k films contain tiny pores with k~1 in the SiOCH matrix, reducing the effective \nfilm density or eventually the dielectric constant (k).  But, the pores have potential issues to \ndegrade the film stability [2] and the dielectric reliability, if we don\u0092t care the pore structure as \nillustrated in Fig. 2.  Namely, the porous low-k film is easy to adsorb moisture (H2O) of k~80.  \nEspecially, in case of the pores clustered to the film surface just like tiny channels, moisture is \nimmersed easily into the film.  The moisture uptake is a serious problem to increase the effective \nk-value [3].  Secondary, the porous low-k film is very sensitive to chemical/physical attacks to \nrelease the hydrocarbon (-CHx) from the low-k matrix, increasing the k-value.  To overcome \nthese issues, physical and chemical structure of the porous films should be controlled precisely. \n \n \n Fig. 1   Structure evolution of LSI interconnects \nfrom 500nm to 65nm-nodes during 16 years. \n \n Fig. 2   Issues on the pours film integration and an ideal \nstructure desired. \n \n Porous \nLow-k\n \n High-k \nBarrier \n(SiCN)\n \n <Damages>\n・Metal PVD\n・Etching\n・O2-Ashing\n \n <Moisture\nuptake>\n \n Leakage, TDDB\n \n CuCuCu ×××\n \n Defects Ideal  Structure\n \n CuCuCu\n \n An Ideal structure;\n�No moisture uptake.\n�No process damage without any recover  processes.\n�No high-k barrie dielectrics (SiCN). \n�Simple one-step deposition without post-cure.\n⇒ Plasma polymerization and Plasma copolymerization.\n \n S\nin\n \n gl\ne \n \n st\nep\n \n Low-k \nBarrier\n \n Stable \nporous film\n \n Porous \nLow-k\n \n High-k \nBarrier \n(SiCN)\n \n <Damages>\n・Metal PVD\n・Etching\n・O2-Ashing\n \n <Moisture\nuptake>\n \n Leakage, TDDB\n \n CuCuCuCu ×××\n \n Defects Ideal  Structure\n \n CuCuCuCu\n \n An Ideal structure;\n�No moisture uptake.\n�No process damage without any recover  processes.\n�No high-k barrie dielectrics (SiCN). \n�Simple one-step deposition without post-cure.\n⇒ Plasma polymerization and Plasma copolymerization.\n \n S\nin\n \n gl\ne \n \n st\nep\n \n Low-k \nBarrier\n \n Stable \nporous film\n \n Mater.

Vol. 1079 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1079-N01-01 \n  \n \n   \n Most of the dielectric films have been deposited by plasma-CVD process, so it is better to \ncontrol the porous structure by the plasma-CVD or the modified ones.  Meanwhile, we \ndeveloped a modified plasma-CVD process, so called as \u0093plasma polymerization (PP) process\u0094 \nat 1999 as shown in Fig. 3.  The idea is quite simple that siloxane monomers with side-chains of \nunsaturated hydrocarbon (USHC) are vaporized, and introduced into He plasma to deposit a \nsiloxane film through the USHC polymerization. This idea was confirmed firstly by using \ndivinyl siloxane benzocyclobuten (DVS-BCB) to deposit the PP BCB film [4-6]. Next, we \nexpected that the PP process could be possible for deposition of a self-organized porous film \nwhen ring-type siloxane molecules with USHC side-chains was used as a precursor [7]. We also \nconsidered that the PP process could extend to a plasma copolymerization (PcP) process by \nintroducing two types of monomers with USHC to reinforce the film properties [8, 9]. \n \n In this paper, first a PP process is explained to deposit a self-organized porous SiOCH \nfilm, so-called as a \u0093Molecular Pore Stack\u0094(MPS) SiOCH film. Then, a newly-developed \nmodulated PcP process is elucidated for the density-modulation in the MPS film.  Finally, based \non the modulated PcP process with sophisticated molecular structure design [10-15], cost-\neffective full low-k Cu interconnects is described. \n \n  \nFig. 3  Physical and chemical structural control of low-k SiOCH films by \nplasma polymerization (PP) and plasma copolymerization (PcP) processes. \n \n  \n \n  \n \n EXPERIMENTAL \nSeveral types of ring-type siloxane monomers were prepared as shown in Table I [17]. \n \n The siloxane was vaporized with He carrier gas, and was introduced into RF plasma chamber \nvacuumed down to 0.1~0.5 torr as shown in Fig. 4.  The film was deposited on a silicon wafer \nheated at 350oC by 100W~400W.  For the PcP or the modulated PcP, a ring-type and a liner-type \nsiloxanes were introduced at the same time with the mixing ratio fixed or modulated, \nrespectively.  The chemical structure and the composition film was analyzed by FTIR, Raman \nspectroscopy, and RBS.  The pore size and silica-backbone-structure were examined by small-\nangle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and solid-state NMR (Si29).  \n  \n \n   \n Table I   Ring-type siloxane monomers used in this \nexperiment [17]. \n \n Si\n \n O\nSi\n \n O\n \n Si\nO\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3 CH3\n \n CH3\n \n RL\n \n RL\n \n RL\n \n H3C\n \n CH3\n \n H3C\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH2 Si\n \n O\nSi\n \n O\n \n Si\nO\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3 CH3\n \n CH3\n \n RL\n \n RL\n \n RL\n \n H3C\n \n CH3\n \n H3C\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH2Si\n \n O\nSi\n \n O\n \n Si\nO\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3 CH3\n \n CH3\n \n RL\n \n RL\n \n RLSi\nO\n \n Si\nO\n \n Si\nO\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3 CH3\n \n CH3\n \n RL\n \n RL\n \n RL\n \n RL\n \n RL\n \n RLSi\nO\n \n Si\nO\n \n Si\nO\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3 CH3\n \n CH3\n \n RS\n \n RS\n \n RSSi\nO\n \n Si\nO\n \n Si\nO\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3 CH3\n \n CH3\n \n RS\n \n RS\n \n RS\n \n SHC\nAlkyl (RL)\n \n SHC\n(Ethyl)\n \n 6\n \n 3E3RL\n \n Ring\n \n SHC\nAlkyl (RS)：\n \n -CH3\n \n USHC\n(Vinyl)\n \n 8\n \n 4V4Rs\n \n Ring RingRingType\n \n SHC\nAlkyl (RL)\n \n SHC\nAlkyl (RS)：\n \n -CH3\n \n Side-chain \n2 (R2)\n \n 66\nMember \n \n of SiO ring\n \n USHC\n(Viny)l\n \n USHC\n(Vinyl)\n \n Side-chain \n1 (R1)\n \n Monomer\nstructure\n \n 3V3RL3V3RSSymbol\n \n SHC\nAlkyl (RL)\n \n SHC\n(Ethyl)\n \n 6\n \n 3E3RL\n \n Ring\n \n SHC\nAlkyl (RS)：\n \n -CH3\n \n USHC\n(Vinyl)\n \n 8\n \n 4V4Rs\n \n Ring RingRingType\n \n SHC\nAlkyl (RL)\n \n SHC\nAlkyl (RS)：\n \n -CH3\n \n Side-chain \n2 (R2)\n \n 66\nMember \n \n of SiO ring\n \n USHC\n(Viny)l\n \n USHC\n(Vinyl)\n \n Side-chain \n1 (R1)\n \n Monomer\nstructure\n \n 3V3RL3V3RSSymbol\n \n Molecular weight : RL>RS\n \n Si\nSi\n \n O\nO\n \n Si O\nSiO\n \n Rs\n \n Rs\n \n Rs\n \n Rs\n \n Si\nSi\n \n O\nO\n \n Si O\nSiO\n \n Si\nSi\n \n O\nO\n \n Si O\nSiO\n \n Rs\n \n Rs\n \n Rs\n \n Rs\n \n Si\nSi\n \n O\nO\n \n Si O\nSiO\n \n  \n \n  \nFig. 4  Low-k deposition system for the PP and \nthe PcP processes, which is based on a \nconventional plasma-CVD system.  \n \n  \n \nRESULTS and DISCUSSION \nMPS SiOCH film by plasma-polymerization (PP) process \n \n \n Chemical and physical structure of SiOCH films depends on molecular structure of the \nprecursor monomers [7]. Namely, in case of the siloxane monomers without USHC side-chains, \nthe precursor monomers were decomposed in He plasma before the film deposition, whose \ncomposition was much different from that of the precursor.  No porous SiOCH film was obtained \nfrom linear-type siloxane monomers.  On contrast, when ring-type siloxane monomer with \nUSHC was used, porous SiOCH film was deposited.  Important finding is that the porous \nstructure was reflected to the original ring structure.  Fig. 5 shows the pore diameter distribution \nand the Raman spectroscopy of the SiOCH films from the precursors of 6-member or 8-member \nrings such as 3V3RL and 4V4Rs, which have the silica rings of 0.36nm and 0.45nm diameters, \nrespectively.  The pore diameter distribution of the SiOCH film from the 6-member ring \n(3V3RL) was smaller than that form the 8-member ring (4V4Rs).  By Raman spectroscopy, it is \nalso found that the SiOCH film from 3V3RL had hexagonal silica network while the SiOCH film \nfrom 4V4Rs composed of poly- or octahedral siloxane network.  Solid-state NMR spectroscopy \nof Si29 indicates that the SiOCH film from 3V3RL consisted of cyclic siloxane networks more \nthan a conventional plasma-CVD SiOCH film.  These experimental results indicate that the ring-\ntype siloxane molecules with USHC side-chains are polymerized in He plasma chamber to \ndeposit a self-organized porous SiOCH films on the Si-wafer.  \n \n The ring-type siloxane molecules have side-chains of saturated hydrocarbon (SHC) as well \nas USHC.  Both of the side-chains are very important for control the plasma reaction or \neventually the deposition rate and/or the chemical composition [17].  Fig. 6 shows the deposition \ncharacteristics of the SiOCH films from the 6-member hexagonal ring-type siloxanes as listed in \nTable I.  From comparison of 3V3Rs with 3E3Rs, the USHC side-chain is confirmed again to \nenhance the deposition rate keeping the k-value low in He plasma.  Comparing 3V3RL with \n3V3Rs, the larger SHC improves the deposition rate and enriches the carbon-comment in the \nfilm. By PALS analysis [16], the SiOCH film from 3V3RL had closed pores in Fig. 7. \n \n Namely, by PP process using the ring-type siloxane with USHC side-chains, self-organized \nporous SiOCH film is obtained without post-cure process such as UV or EB radiation [18].  \n  \n \n   \n Hereafter, the porous SiOCH film from 3V3RL is called as MPS SiOCH film. The MPS-SiOCH \nfilm of k~2.5 is featured as a hydrocarbon-rich SiOCH film with 0.36nm-diameter pores, while \nthe conventional PECVD SiOCH films are oxygen-rich or carbon-poor as shown in Table II. \n \n  \n \n Fig. 5  Characteristics of the SiOCH films by the PP process using 6-member (3V3RL) or 8-\nmenber (4V4Rs) ring-type siloxanes; (a) schematic illustration of the plasma reaction process, (b) \npore-diameter distribution by SAXS, (c) Raman and (d) Solid-state NMR (Si29) spectroscopes. \n \n Fig. 6  Characteristics of the SiOCH films by the PP process using 6-member ring-type siloxanes \nhaving different side-chain chemicals; (a) the deposition rate and (b) the k-vales as a function of \nthe deposition pressure, and (c) the chemical composition in the films (RBS) [17]. \n \n \n  \nTable II   Properties of SiOCH films. \n \n Fig. 7  PALS of bare and capped films of porgen-type \nand non-porogen-type porous SiOCH films. The MPS \nfilm had no difference between the bare and the capped \nfilms, indicative of closed pores in the film [16].  \n  \n \n   \n Stability of MPS SiOCH film \n  \n \n The MPS SiOCH film, which has carbon-rich hexagonal silica backbone with sub-nanometer \npores, is superior stability against moisture uptake and plasma-induced damages.  Fig. 8 shows \nthe k-value increment of the SiOCH films as a function of the pore diameter after water dipping \nand PCT test (125oC, 100%-humidity).  In case of the dipping in water, no k-value increment \nwas observed, indicative of no water immersion into the pores within 1nm-dieameters.  After \nsever PCT test, the k-value increased due to the moisture uptake into the pores over 0.6nm-\ndiameters.  No k-value increment was observed for the MPS film even though the PCT test.   \n \n Fig. 9 shows the k-value increment after PVD Ta barrier metal deposition as a function of the \nDC bias to the Ta target [19].  Note that, in this RF PVD system, lower DC bias to the target \ndecrease the substrate bias.  In case of the conventional carbon-poor SiOCH films in Table II, the \nk-values increased over -40V biases, while k-value of the MPS film was unchanged even at 0V \nbias or the maximum substrate bias.  By FTIR analysis, the conventional carbon-poor SiOCH \nfilms lost a lot of hydrocarbons by the Ta ion bombardment, resulting in alternation of Si-CH3 \nbonds to Si-H bond.  In case of the MPS film with large hydrocarbon side-chains, the \nhydrocarbon content decreased by the Ta bombardment, but the Si-CH3 bonds did not decrease \ndue to protection of the silica backbone by the long hydrocarbon chains from the direct \nbombardment of Ta ions.  Fig. 10 shows XSEM of the Cu damascene interconnects as a function \nof O2 plasma ashing time duration.  Here, the damage layer of hydrocarbon depletion was \ndetected by dipping in diluted HF solution [20]. It is found that the hydrocarbon-rich MPS film \nhad the strongest endurance to the O2 plasma. \n \n The MPS SiOCH film of k~2.5 has been implemented as inter-metal dielectric (IMD) film \nfor 45nm-node ULSI with the 140nm-pitched lines [12] as shown in Fig. 11.  The effective k-\nvalue of the interconnect module (keff) including high-k SiCN cap was 2.95, decreasing the \nsignal delay of a interconnect-loaded ring-oscillator by 15% to a 65nm-node structure with \nkeff=3.4.

The ring-type and the linear-type siloxanes are \ncopolymerized through the USHC side-chains in He plasma.  In case of the 100% injection of the \nlinear-type siloxane, a silica-amorphous carbon composite (SACC) film was deposited with \nk=3.1, detected by Raman spectroscopy in Fig. 13(b). The SACC film had extremely high \nmodulus of 26 GPa.  By mixing the monomer gas of the linear-type to the ring-type, the k-value \nand the modulus of the MPS film increased as shown in Fig. 13(c).  Conversely, this fact \nindicates us that the MPS film properties could be controlled by changing the mixing ratio such \nas 20% ⇒ 100% ⇒ 0% (100% of linear-type) of the ring-type in the one deposition scheme.  By \nthe modulated PcP process, a Cu dual damascene (DD) module with 100nm-pitched lines was \nfabricated with a density-modulated MPS film [14], in which the MPS IMD film was \nsandwiched between the copolymerized MPS via-ILD and the SACC of surface protection hard-\nmask (HM) as shown in Fig. 14.  In other words, the upper and bottom interfaces of the MPS \nfilm were reinforced by the SACC and the copolymerized MPS with SACC.  The interconnect \nmodule had keff=2.95 including high-k SiCN capping layer on the Cu lines.   \n \n Fig. 15 shows Pool-Frenkel (PF) plots of the leakage currents between the 50nm-spced \nlines in the moderated MPS film as well as the MPS films with the SiO2-HM or the SiOCH-HM \n[14]. These HM layers were deposited by multi-step process with air break.  The modulated MPS \nstructure reduced the leakage current very much. The active energies were similar between the \nthree structures, but the pre-exponential factor, which was related to the defect density, was \n1/2000 smaller than the multi-step MPS films.  The high endurance of the modulated MPS film \nmight be related to suppression of the defects at the interface by the modulated PcP process. \n \n Namely, it is confirmed that the modulated MSP structure is desirable for the scaled-\ndown interconnects to keep dielectric endurance by the modulated PcP process using ring-type \nand linear-type siloxane monomers. \n \n \n  \n \n Fig. 14  A 100nm-pitched Cu DD interconnects in the density-modified MPS SiOCH films by modified PcP \nprocess.  Here, the gas mixing ratio of the ring and linear types is changed during the deposition such as 20%, \n100% and 0% of the ring-type. As the result, the MPS IMD film is sandwiched between the copolymerized \nMPS via-ILD and the thin SACC of surface protection hard-mask (HM) layer. By RBS analysis, the \ncompositional profile of the modulated MPS film in the film thickness direction is modulated by \ncorresponding to the mixing ratio modulation [14]. \n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n RRR\n \n Cu-\nalloy\n \n Elastic modulus\n(GPa)\n \n 24.8\n \n k=2.5\n \n k=3.1\n \n k=2.8\n \n 3.0\n \n 12.6\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n RRR\n \n +\n \n 100nm-pitch\n \n SiCN\n \n Si\n \n O\nC\n \n IMD\n \n Via-ILD\n \n Composition \nprofiles\n \n H\nM\n \n SiCN-cap\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n RRRRRRR\n \n Cu-\nalloy\n \n Elastic modulus\n(GPa)\n \n 24.8\n \n k=2.5\n \n k=3.1\n \n k=2.8\n \n 3.0\n \n 12.6\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n RRRRRRR\n \n +\n \n 100nm-pitch\n \n SiCN\n \n Si\n \n O\nC\n \n IMD\n \n Via-ILD\n \n Composition \nprofiles\n \n H\nM\n \n SiCN\n \n Si\n \n O\nC\n \n IMD\n \n Via-ILD\n \n Composition \nprofiles\n \n H\nM\n \n SiCN-cap \n  \n \n   \n  \nFig. 16   Pool-Frenkel plots of the 50nm-spaced Cu lines in the modulated MPS \nfilms by the modulated PcP process as well as the multi-stepped MPS films with \nSiO2-HM and SiOCH-HM [14] \n \n  \n \n  \nUltimate Full Low-k Interconnect toward 22nm-node and beyond \n  \n We found that the SACC had excellent barrier property against the Cu diffusion even \nthough the k-value was 3.1, which could be utilized as a low-k capping layer, instead of high-k \nSiCN layer, on Cu lines [15] as shown in Fig. 17.  So, we incorporated the SACC-cap in the \nmodulated MSP deposition scheme, in which the gas mixing ration was changed as 100% ⇒ \n80%  ⇒ 0%  ⇒ 100% injection of the linear-type siloxane to the ring-type one for the capping \nlayer, the via-ILD, the IMD and the surface protection HM layer, respectively.  Fig. 18 shows \nXTEM micrograph and RBS compositional profiles of the Cu interconnects in the modulated \nMPS film with the SACC capping layer seamlessly.  Here, before the SACC deposition, the Cu \nline  surface was treated by anti-oxidation coating in the same reaction chamber. The effective k-\nvalue of the interconnect module was reduced from 2.95 with the SiCN-cap to 2.75 with the \nSACC-cap.  No degradation was observed in the dielectric endurance between the lines.  \nMoreover, the EM reliability was improved due to simplicity in the deposition process. \n  Fig. 18 summarizes the structural evaluation of the Cu interconnect modules from the \nMPS-SiOCH film to the intimate full low-k MPS SiOCH films.  All of these MPS-based SiOCH \nfilms are based on the PP or the modulated PcP processes using the hexagonal ring-type and the \nlinear-type siloxanes.  The in-situ density-modulation in the MPS SiOCH film accomplishes \nrobust low-k module to reinforce the interfaces without defect introduction under simple and \ncost-effective process. \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \n \n By the modulated PcP process, physical and chemical structures in porous SiOCH films is \nmanipulated by molecular level. The self-organized pore structure was obtained by the PP \nprocess using the hexagonal ring-type siloxane with USHC side-chains.  The MPS film with  \n  \n \n   \n hydro carbon-rich hexagonal silica matrix has high endurance to the process damage.  By in-situ \nmodulated PcP process using the ring-type and the linear-type siloxanes, a full low-k module of \nkeff=2.75 with low-k SACC cap was realized with good mechanical strength, adhesion and \nreliability, at a low manufacturing cost.  The modulated PcP process is a key technology for \nscaled-down ULSI fabrication toward 32/22nm-nodes integrations. \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n \n This research has been done in LSI Fundamental Research Laboratory, NEC ELECTRONICS \nand NEC.

We report the effects of bottom redundancy layers on \nelectrical line and via resistance and upstream electromigration performance. We studied 4 \nmetallization stacks:  (I) Ti/TiN/AlCu/Ti/TiN, (II) Ti/TiN/Ti/AlCu/Ti/TiN (annealed at 400oC \nfor 20 minutes), (III) a flash process/stack I, (IV) stack III with aluminum deposition temperature \nof 250oC. Aluminum deposition temperature in stacks I, II, and III are 200oC.  Bottom Ti/TiN, \nAlCu, and Top Ti/TiN layers have the same thickness for all these stacks. Metal line Rs and via \ncontact resistances (Rc) of stack IV are 5% and 10% lower, respectively, than stack I. Stack II \nmetal line sheet resistance is 15% higher than stack I, which is attributed to Al consumption in \nthe TiAl3 formation during 400\n \n oC/20minutes annealing. Electromigration performance is best \nwith stack IV followed by III, II, then I. \n \n  \n \n \n INTRODUCTION \n \n \n Aluminum interconnect technology is increasingly challenged at smaller technology \nnodes. While copper interconnect reliability has received much attention, most Analog/Mixed \nSignal applications are not being built in Cu due to cost [1]. Reducing thermal budgets, BEOL \nwiring/via requirements and defect density requirements have increased the manufacturing \nchallenges of building reliable aluminum wires. In particular, technologies that have thermal \nbudget constraints are limited in ways to improve electromigration resistance that do not increase \nmetal line resistances or put constraints on designers by requiring via redundancies or metal wire \nextensions. Doping of aluminum wires can improve electromigration performance, but at the \nexpense of metal line resistance. Annealing of wiring to allow for diffusion of dopant, grain \ngrowth or intermetallic formation, such as TiAl3, have all been demonstrated to improve \nelectromigration performance [2-4]. However such techniques are not practical in technologies \nthat have thermal constraints or where BEOL R-C performance requires the lowest possible wire \nand via resistances. Additionally, redundant vias and line extensions [5] can be used to extend \nEM lifetimes but at the expense of silicon area and may impart layout constraints.  \n \n In this study, we report the effects of the bottom redundancy layer on the \nelectromigration performance and wire/via resistances. \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1079 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1079-N09-01 \n  \n \n   \n   \n EXPERIMENT \n \n  Using a combined Cu and Al 180nm technology, electromigration and generic electrical \ntest macros (kerf) structures were fabricated on 200mm wafers. Wafer processing was started at \npoly-silicon (PC) through CA (W) contact, then M1 was processed with Cu damascene. A V1 \n(W) via in SiO2 connects to M1. M2 metallization experiments with the four metallization (I-IV) \nstacks were run. Table 1 provides the process descriptions for each stack. The aluminum \ncomposition is Al-0.5%wt Cu. All films were deposited by PVD in conventional DC Magnetron \nPVD equipment using planar sources. The aluminum deposition was temperature controlled \nusing an electrostatic chuck. All other metal films have no temperature control. The wafers were \ninitially degassed using lamp heating in a vacuum for water desorption. Stack III, IV used a 5 nm \noxide equivalent preclean prior to W deposition. Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of stacks \nI, II, and III, IV. \n \n                                                                              \n \n   \nTable 1, Process Description                                          Fig. 1, Schematic of M2 stacks I-IV \n \nWafers were exposed to ambient atmosphere between the W PVD deposition in stacks III, IV \nand the balance of the stack (air break). The top Ti/TiN was deposited in the same PVD chamber \nwith no target conditioning between wafers. The bottom Ti and TiN were deposited in separate \nPVD chambers. After M2 definition, a V2-M3 and final via/bond pad were built to replicate \nmanufacturing process flow. For stack II, the M2 was annealed post M2 etch. \n \n M2 Rs and V1 Rc were measured on kerf structures using M2 serpentines and M2-V1-\nM1 via chains, respectively. TEM analysis was conducted on structures to examine the wire to \nvia and wire to insulator interfaces. \n \n Electromigration was measured at M2 on minimum dimension, single via structures with \nno metal extensions over the vias [6]. The nominal M2 line is 0.28 μm wide and 200 μm long. \n \n  \nStack \n \n Process Description \n \n I \n150c degas, 15nm Ti, 20nm TiN, \n370nm Al @200c, 5nm Ti/70nm TiN \n \n II \n150c degas, 15nm Ti, 20nm TiN, \n10nm Ti, 370nm Al @200c, 5nm \nTi/70nm TiN \n \n III \n \n 250c degas, 5nm preclean, 10nm W, \n+ air break + \n250c degas, 15nm Ti, 20nm TiN, \n370nm Al @200c, 5nm Ti/70nm TiN \n \n IV \n \n 250c degas, 5nm preclean, 10nm W, \n+ air break + \n250c degas, 15nm Ti, 20nm TiN, \n370nm Al @250c, 5nm Ti/70nm TiN  \n  \n \n   \n The V1 diameter is 0.24 μm. Electromigration evaluations were carried out on all four stacks at \n250oC stress temperature and stress current densities between 10 to 15 mA/μm 2. Current flow is \nM1-V1-M2. Using 20% resistance increase (dR/R) as the failure criterion, the lifetime \ndistributions of all four stacks exhibit bi-modal behavior. The normalized lifetimes of the early \nmodes of three liner stacks are about 1X for stack I, 1.5X for stack II, 2X stack III and 3X for \nstack IV. \n \n \n RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \n \n  \n \n Metal Wire and Via Resistances \n \n Metal 2 Rs was measured on kerf structures. Figure 2 shows the effect of the stack \ncomposition on metal 2 wire resistance.  \n      \n \n            \n \n                  Fig. 2, Metal 2 Rs of Stacks I-IV                          Fig. 3, Via 1 Chain Rc of Stacks I-IV    \n \n  \nClearly, adding the Ti in Stack II increases the Metal 2 Rs. This is due to TiAl3 formation in the \nAl layer. The 5% improvement in Metal 2 Rs in Stack IV is due to the increased deposition \ntemperature of the Al from 200oC to 250oC .  \n Fig. 3 shows the V1 chain Rc by stack. A significant reduction in via 1 chain Rc is \nobserved when the top connection to the via is made with a W redundant layer (stacks III and \nIV). Usually, Ti is used to getter oxides from the top via surface to reduce via Rc, however our \ndata shows that a via exposed to an Ar preclean then capped with W has 10% lower via Rc than \nwhen using Ti. The W layer also provides a low resistance shunt. Stack IV produces the lowest \nvia Rc and lowest Al metal Rs. \n \n \n Electromigration Performance \n \n Electromigration lifetimes were evaluated on all four metal stacks at 250oC stress \ntemperature and stress current densities between 10 and 15 mA/μm 2. For a 20% resistance  \n  \n \n   \n increase as the failure criterion, the lifetime distributions of all four stacks exhibit bi-modal \nbehavior (Fig. 4a) since the fail distribution does not lie on a straight line. Stack II allows for a \nsingle mode and is due to continued reaction of Ti with Al forming TiAl3 driving resistance \nhigher. However, the t50 time for stack II is below the 2.0mA/μm 2. Failure analysis (Fig. 4b) \nsuggests that the two modes are differentiated by the void locations. For the early mode, the \nelectromigration voids are located immediately at the cathode end of the test line. In this case, \nonly the bottom redundant liner is left to carry current when the voids grow big enough to pass \nthe edge of the bottom W via. In contrast, the voids of the late mode fails are located somewhat \naway from the cathode end of the line beyond the via such that both the bottom and the top liners \nare able to shunt the electrical current after voids of late mode fails have grown to extend over \nthe entire AlCu cross sectional area. An inspection of Table 2 shows that the t50 times are \nimproved by ~1.5x and the sigma reduced by 50% using stack IV compared to stack I. The \nresistance versus time curves, R(t), Fig. 5, of stack I have more abrupt resistance increases at \nshorter electromigration stress durations than those of either stack II or stack III/IV. The R(t) \ncurve of stack II shows very good behavior, but, there is a resistance penalty of allowing titanium \nto react with aluminum. More accurately the stack II plot represents in part a resistance change \ndue to Ti reacting with Al resulting in shorter t50 times. The anneal conditions during processing \nfor stack II are not sufficient to convert all the Ti into TiAl3. The anneal limitation is imposed by \nthe presence of Cu wiring at M1. The R(t) plots of stack III/IV show very good stability, and \nperhaps some benefit to running at 250oC. Failure analysis of a fail with an abrupt resistance \nincrease (Fig. 6) after the 20% fail criteria has been reached shows a thermal runaway signature \nat the bottom redundant layer of stack I. This type of failure will cause a catastrophic failure in \nthe circuit. \n \n      \n            Fig. 4a EM lifetimes of Stacks I-IV                        Fig. 4b, Early and Late mode fail \n \n \nThe void characteristics and resistance time behavior of electromigration imply that the bottom \nliner plays the most critical role.  \n  \n  \n \n   \n      \n Fig. 5 Resistance vs time of Stacks I-IV                                  Table 2, t50, sigma \n  (all y axis 100-350 ohms, all x-axis 0-60 hours) \n  \n \n \n  \n \n Physical Analysis \n \nThere are no M2 extensions over V1 vias by design and the M2 wire is landed on a single \n \n via (Fig. 4b). Since the early mode fail is associated with the cathode end (void over the via) and \nthe bottom redundant layer carries all the current, improving the bottom redundant layer will \nimprove the early mode fail. Fig 4b shows the late mode fail with the void occurring away from \nthe via. Fig. 6 shows melting of the redundant layer. It is noted that the metal wire is \nforeshortened on the via by observing the chamfering of the via. Since the design calls for a \nsingle via contacted by a minimum dimension wire, and no extensions, foreshortening over the \nvia can occur. Clearly, the wire has failed. This suggests that the bottom Ti layer in Stack I is less \nconductive than designed for. Contamination of the bottom Ti with the V1 oxide is possible.  \nFig. 7 shows that the W redundant layer in an early mode fail is robust. Here too, the line is \nforeshortened on the via, meaning no connection is possible with the top redundant layer when \nthe void exposes the via.               \n \n                                \n       Fig. 6, Early Mode fail,     Fig. 7, W redundant layer intact \n          ruptured redundancy \n \n   \n  \n \n   \n EDX analysis of samples submitted for TEM show that the bottom titanium layer reacts \nwith the SiO2 insulator and in the early fail mode this results in earlier fail times. The reaction of \nthe Ti with the SiO2 results in a higher resistance redundant layer leaving less Ti cross section to \ncarry current. Fig. 8, 9 shows elemental analysis for the bottom layers of stack I and III, \nrespectively. It can be seen in Fig. 8 that oxygen is incorporated into the titanium, raising its \nresistance, while the tungsten, in Fig. 9 prevents reaction of titanium with the SiO2 interface.  \n \n \n  \n            Fig. 8, EDX analysis of stack I                            Fig. 9, EDX analysis of stack III \n \nThe Ti signal in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 includes both Ti and TiN from the bottom layers. Limiting the \nTi reaction with the oxide and providing a low resistance shunt to the via will improve the early \nmode fail time and improve the t50 time for EM resistance.  Fig. 9 shows Ti and Al in the W and \nis due to beam interference caused by the W layer. Fig. 10 shows a TEM with EDX scan of a \nfailed line over the stud using Stack I. The TEM shows TiAl mixing over the W stud. In \naddition, the TEM in Fig. 10 clearly shows the ruptured bottom redundancy adjacent to the stud. \nJoule heating results in a thermal runaway as void size increases. The resistance of the bottom \nredundancy is increasing as the void progresses away from the stud. As the void length increases, \nheat conduction is only through the bottom insulator resulting in thermal runaway [7]. This is \nseen as an electrical fail as in Fig. 5, Stack I, as shown by a near digital increase in wire \nresistance. \n \n \n  \n \n                              Fig 10, TEM/EDX of failure area, Stack I  \n  \n \n   \n CONCLUSIONS \n \n \n We have shown that in high performance aluminum interconnect structures the bottom \nredundant layer is the most critical factor in improving early mode electromigration failure. \nSpecifically, where thermal budget constraints exist, a \u2018No Anneal\u2019 metallurgy stack must be \nutilized, such as Ti/TiN/Al/TiN. This structure is common in the industry, but fails to meet EM \nrequirements where minimum ground rules exist. We have shown the benefit of using W as a \nfirst redundant layer to improve the electromigration lifetimes and to eliminate the possibility of \ncatastrophic circuit failure. The requirements, therefore, of a bottom redundant layer are to be \nchemically inert, and have a high melting temperature and low resistivity. \n \n  \n \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \nThe authors would like to thank Carl Farris for support in wafer fabrication, Chuck Cox for SEM \nand Phil Pokrinchak for TEM/EDX analysis and Chad M Burke, Kevin Lindstam and Randy \nAustin for EM testing support. \n \n  \n \n \n REFERENCES \n \n \n 1. http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=QH2WVHB4JSY2SQSNDLRSK\nH0CJUNN2JVN?articleID=205602370 \n \n 2.

The barium-content dependence indicates the tradeoff between tunability and dielectric loss, and the notable field-induced loss in SrTiO3 is confirmed as an intrinsic quasi-Debye contribution. The Mg dopant incorporated into a perovskite lattice shows almost no effectiveness on tunable device performance, except for enhanced insulation as an electron acceptor, while the low bias-field dependence of the dielectric loss suggests the possibility of the partial occupation of the alkaline-earth-ion site by Mg. The reduction of in-plane thermal stress controlled by the pressure during sputtering deposition leads to higher permittivity and tunability while degrading the film crystallinity by ion bombardment. The low-frequency loss tends to increase with crystal damage; however, the microwave loss remains unchanged, revealing the applicability of sputtering stress control to real microwave devices. In addition, we demonstrate the operation of an analog phase shifter using parallel-plate ferroelectric tunable capacitors and its application to a phased array antenna monolithically integrated on a

The effects of various surface treatments were investigated in the sample having a pore size of 0.9 nm and a porosity of 25%. Before and after annealing, samples were analyzed in cross section with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Concentration profile was also analyzed with time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS). The results indicated the penetration of Cu into the low-k interior during deposition, followed by the segregation of Cu at the low-k/Si interface during subsequent annealing. Although a diffusion barrier layer was formed and no further Cu penetration was not observed during annealing, initial Cu penetration in the deposition process was detrimental and should be prevented by restoring the plasma damage on the low-k surface. \n (Received May 01 2008) \n (Accepted May 01 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t barrier layer;  \n\t dielectric properties;  \n\t diffusion \n
