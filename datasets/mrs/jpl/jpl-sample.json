Whelan3, Mansour Moinpour4, and Karen Maex5 \n1ESAT, KULeuven, Leuven, 3001, Belgium \n2IMEC, Kapeldreef 75, Leuven, 3001, Belgium \n3IMEC, Leuven, 3001, Belgium \n4INTEL, Santa Clara, CA, 95052 \n5KULeuven, Leuven, 3001, Belgium \n \nABSTRACT \n \n \n The results of copper Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) experiments with a model slurry \nchemistry based on the combination of Glycine-water-Benzotriazole (Gly-H2O2-BTA), and different types \nof composite A  (silane coupling agents between the polymer core and the silica shell) and B (electrostatic \nattraction between the polymer core and the silica shell) abrasives, are presented. While the presence of \nBTA allows a ten-fold reduction in the static etch rate from 95 nm/min. to 10 nm/min., combining \noxidizer and complexing agent leads to removal rates higher than 400 nm/min. Different surface \nmorphology and RMS roughness are observed after polishing with composite abrasives and different \nperoxide concentrations. Oxidizer concentrations as low as 0.1 vol.% lead to high non-uniformity and \ndefectivity values. In particular, composite B performs better than pure colloidal/fumed silica during \ncopper CMP using the IC-1000 pad, giving comparable Material Removal Rate (MRR), but a better \nsurface finish due to the contribution of the elasticity of the polymer in gently transferring the applied \nload to the wafer surface. Cu CMP with pure polymer particles is a promising alternative to the hard \ninorganic material especially if combined with suitable surfactants that act from both particle stabilization \nand friction reduction / lubrication improvement perspectives. \n \n The use of the medium/high-hardness pad IC-1000 is compared to the use of a soft Politex pad. In the \nformer case, differences in terms of MRR, MRS roughness, and total defects are observed between the \ncomposite abrasives A and B; in the latter case, the behaviour of the two composites is similar. In the case \nof a soft pad in combination with composite abrasives, there is a remarkable improvement in the \ndefectivity without any loss in MRR.  \n \n As revealed by SEM inspection of the composite particles collected in the slurry drain after CMP, for \nall the composites, the silica shell coverage is not disrupted by the shear forces and chemistry during the 1 \nmin. polishing. Consequently, the stability and agglomeration properties of the particles in the complex \nCu CMP chemistry can be helpful in explaining the experimental results in terms of MRR and surface \nfinishing.  \n \n  \nINTRODUCTION \n \n \n In the copper deposition sequence, there are three main areas where defects can be introduced and \nhave an impact on yield: i) during barrier/seed deposition; ii) during electrofill; and iii) during CMP. The \nmost important yield limiting defect types after copper CMP are scratches, voids and pitting since they \ncan create shorts in dense metal lines and long-term reliability failures. Choice of abrasive and chemistry \nin the slurry is considered as one of the main contributing root causes. A bad combination of abrasive and \nchemistry and hard foreign matters from the slurry or environment, are the root causes. Furthermore, Cu \nis known to easily corrode. A Cu film with very large grain size may be easier to corrode along the grain \nboundaries, where the grain size is dependent mainly on the annealing conditions. Corrosion activity is \nenhanced under high mechanical stress (stress-induced corrosion). Usually, a corrosion inhibitor is \nnecessary in the slurry. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate if the composite abrasives \nalready extensively evaluated through oxide CMP experiments [1], can constitute a useful alternative to \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1079 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1079-N11-04 \n  \n \n   \n replace the standard silica and alumina particles, in order to improve defectivity, without loosing their \nbeneficial properties, e.g. MRR and Non-Uniformity (NU). While the effect of the chemical component in \nthe CMP process has been studied extensively [2-5], the role of the mechanical component, that has a \nstrong impact on defect formation, remains unclear. Despite a high number of theoretical models \navailable in literature [6-13], based on different kinds of interaction between pad, particle and wafer, \nexperimental data is scarce. The sheer number of variables associated with the abrasives complicates our \nunderstanding of how particles contribute to the MRR, defectivity and surface finishing. Furthermore, \ndespite the volume of patent literature and commercial slurries available, due to the proprietary nature of \nmost CMP compositions, the information that can be gleaned from these sources relevant for the \ndevelopment of next-generation slurries is limited.  \n \n Our research focuses on entirely novel composite structures comprising polymer particles coated by \nsmaller silica colloids, achieved by either creating chemical bonds by silane-coupling agents (composite \nA) or tuning the pH in order to form electrostatic attractive interactions between the core and the shell \n(composite B). In this way, it is possible to combine several advantageous properties in the same \nstructure. The polymer core shows mechanical properties that are highly tunable by variation of its \nsynthesis parameters [14, 15], while the major advantage of the silica coating is that it can be easily \nmodified, in terms of its surface chemistry and morphology.  \n \n In particular, our composite particles are aimed at improving the CMP process of easily damaged \nmaterials such as copper, due to the spring-like effect coming from the elastic properties of the core, \nwhich allows the composites to easily adapt to the pad asperities. \n \n The main advantage of our bottom-up approach to particle synthesis is the predetermined control of \nthe chemical composition of the system and physical properties of the individual components. Post-\nsynthesis characterization of our particles includes bulk properties, such as the elastic compressive \nmodulus [16], size, morphology, and surface properties, such as surface charge, functional groups. In \nparticular, the ζ potential of the particles vs. changes in ionic strength and pH gives essential information \non the stability and agglomeration behaviour of the particles in the polishing solution, which is expected \nto correlate closely with scratch formation during CMP [17].  \n \n  \nEXPERIMENT \n \nMaterials and set-ups. For all the copper CMP experiments, 200 mm copper wafers were obtained by \ndepositing a 25 nm Ta (15 nm)/TaN (10 nm) diffusion barrier, and a 100 nm Cu seed layer deposited in a \nphysical vapor deposition (PVD) chamber (ElectraTM, AMAT) on a standard dielectric stack (500 nm \nSiO2 on 50 nm Si3N4). 1 µm Cu film is deposited by electrochemical deposition (Electra-ECP-Cu, \nAMAT) using Shipley Nanoplate plating bath chemistry. To allow post-CMP characterization in Cu-\nshared tools, some of the wafers received a backside 50 nm nitride layer. The polishing tool was a rotary \npolisher (E 460 Mecapol polisher, Alpsitec). The details of the materials used are summarized in Table 1. \nThe particles used as abrasives in the slurry are presented in Table 2. For the preparation of the slurry, a \nmechanical shaker was applied for 10 min. before the CMP experiments. During the polishing, the slurry \nwas stirred by a magnetic bar at a speed of 400 rpm. \n \n  \nTable 1.

After CMP the copper wafers were kept wet in a DI water tank in order \nto avoid that the particles and polishing residues irreversibly stick to the wafer surface. After a constant \nwaiting time of longer than 1 h, to avoid serious corrosion of the copper surface, the wafers were \nprocessed in the cleaning station of the AMAT Mirra-Mesa polisher through the wet que. The wafers \nfrom the input station passed through the Megasonic cleaning station, two brush stations, the spin-rinse \ndry (SRD) station, and finally they reached the output station. The recipe used was Marathon and only DI \nwater was used for the rinsing.  \n \n  \nDefectivity and surface morphology investigation. The defectivity on non-patterned full copper wafers \nwas determined by a light scattering method. For the experiments made in the first part of this work with \na Politex pad, silica, polymer and composite particles, the SP1DLS tool was used and a recipe was \nspecifically optimized for copper wafers after polishing (IP: s; CP_W: s; CP_N:s; Aperture: 20 degree, \ncalibrated). This recipe allowed a minimum defect size of 254 nm. For the defectivity measurements after \ncopper CMP with the harder pad IC 1000 and a range of chemistry/abrasives we used the Surfscan 6400 \nbut, since the number of defects in this case was much higher leading to the overload of the detector, we \nhad to lower the minimum defect size threshold to 700 nm. This should be constantly considered when \ncomparing the defectivity data. \n \n To investigate the surface morphology we used the AFM technique. WSxM software [18] assisted the \nextraction of cross-sectional data and facilitated 3D elaboration of the images. \n \n  \nCopper layer Rs measurement. Sheet Resistance (Rs) measurements on copper unpatterned wafers were \nperformed using the Prometrix OmniMap RS75 four probe system (conditions: 49 points measured \u0096 10 \nmm edge exclusion). The Rs of a layer with resisitivity ρ, and thickness t, is given by their ratio: Rs=ρ/t  \n \n  \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \n \n \n Model copper slurry chemical composition. Compared to CMP for silicon dioxide, the metal \n(particularly copper) CMP process is poorly understood, due mainly to electrochemical interactions \nbetween the slurry and the metal film during polishing, and the coupled effect of these on the mechanical \nproperties of the surface. Optimization of the slurry chemistry for Cu is beyond the scope of this work. \nNevertheless, a meaningful interpretation of the experimental results in terms of MRR and surface \nfinishing can only arise from the understanding of the slurry system and the awareness of the complex \ninteractions between all the slurry components. \n \n  \nCopper CMP mechanism in the model slurry chemistry. The most commonly accepted planarization \nmechanism in metal CMP is Kaufman\u0092s tungsten CMP model [19]. In this model, the slurry chemistry is  \n  \n \n   \n such that it induces formation of a protective passivating film on the metal surface. Passivation could be \ncaused by formation of native metal oxides on the surface using oxidizers such as H2O2. Chemically \nadsorbed layers can also be formed using organic inhibitors. For example, benzotriazole (BTA), a \ncommon corrosion inhibitor for copper, could be utilized in copper CMP slurries [20]. In an ideal CMP \nprocess, the protective film is removed by the mechanical action of the abrasive slurry only at the \nprotruding regions where the wet etch of unprotected metal occurs until metal repassivates. Oxidizers are \nchemical reagents that change the oxidation state of the metal. They have a dual function in the slurry. \nThey can form oxides which protects the recessed regions from the wet etch as well as induce dissolution \nof metal at the protruding regions. Continuous cycles of formation, removal and reformation of the \npassive layer continue until the desired final thickness of planar metal surface is attained. In copper \nchemical mechanical planarization, in addition to wet etching of the unprotected metal surface, the \nchemical reagents in the slurry should also be able to completely dissolve all the abraded material [21]. \nThis is necessary to prevent precipitation of abraded copper particles as well as to avoid redeposition of \ncopper ions back to the wafer. In order to preserve the desired passivation and dissolution behaviour, the \nslurry pH should be always controlled. Copper CMP in a highly acidic pH regime leads to corrosion \nproblems, while Cu CMP in alkaline conditions is faced with an unfavorable polish rate selectivity with \nrespect to SiO2, leading to interlayer dielectric (ILD) erosion. Thus, an intermediate pH range 4-7 appears \nto be a better choice for Cu CMP [22-24]. One of the more attractive slurries in this intermediate pH \nrange consists of hydrogen peroxide, glycine (an amino acid), and an abrasive.  \n \n We measured the MRR and defectivity after each CMP experiment with colloidal silica 90 nm 5wt.% \nand only one of the three chemicals (oxidizer, complexing agent, and corrosion inhibitor) or with a \ncombination of two by two of them.  \n \n Our results plotted in Figure 1a show that although the MRR of copper in a pure H2O2 solution is as \nsmall as 7 nm/min., it increases dramatically (by a factor of 60) in the presence of glycine.  Interestingly, \nall the other combinations of chemicals give lower MRR. The combination of the three chemicals without \nany abrasive leads to a MRR of ca. 150 nm/min.  \n \n The effectiveness of glycine is attributed to hydroxyl radicals, which are responsible for the removal \nof copper from the surface through intermediate oxidation steps, generated copiously through the catalytic \naction of a complex formed by the glycine with the copper ions in solution. The static etch rate for copper \nin the presence of the chemical composition of the model slurry (1vol.% H2O2, 1wt.% Gly, and \n0.018wt.% BTA) in the same pH 5-6 was ca. 10 nm/min., while in the absence of BTA it dramatically \nincreases until 95 nm/min.  Benzotriazole (BTAH-C5H4N3H) has one replaceable H atom attached to the \nN1 atom in the triazole group. The BTA\n \n - ion forms a solid cuprous complex. This complex is known to be \nresponsible for the corrosion inhibiting properties of BTAH [25, 26]. \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 1. a) Thickness removed, b) Non-Uniformity, and c) Sum of defects vs. slurry abrasive type and chemical \ncomposition. \n \n \n It is now worth discussing the role of the hydrogen peroxide as oxidizer during copper CMP.

We experimentally found that very \nlow oxidizer concentrations lead to high NU and defectivity values. Particularly interesting is the AFM \nanalysis of the copper surface after CMP with 5wt.% composite B abrasive in the presence of 0.1 and \n10vol.% H2O2 shown in Figure 2 a and b, respectively. The different morphology of the two surfaces is \nimmediately evident.  The former exhibits higher RMS roughness and copper rip-out kind of defects very \nsimilar to the defects appearing on the copper surface after etching for 1 min. in pure chemicals, Figure 2 \nc. The depth of the voids created is more than double the value of the scratches observed in the presence \nof 10wt.% oxidizer. The plot of the RMS and Ra roughness versus oxidizer concentration shown in \nFigure 3 highlights the increase in the surface roughness with decreasing oxidizer concentration.   From \nthe shape of the defects shown in Figure 2 a and c we can formulate the hypothesis that there is a \npreferential attack and penetration of the chemicals along the copper grain boundaries. This effect sums \nup to the frictional forces acting during CMP (i.e. stick-slip) [25, 26].   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 2.

Nevertheless, the total number of defects is below 2200 defects. \n \n As we already found for oxide CMP defectivity vs. composite core/shell size ratio [27], the use of the \nlargest size polymer as a core in composite A leads to the lowest amount of defectivity and lowest \nmaximum scratch depth. When used in the composite shell, the small 15 nm silica particles remain on the \nwafer after the post-CMP cleaning step. They affect both the total defect number and the RMS roughness. \nMoreover, smallest particles are more prone to agglomeration and larger agglomerates cause an increase \nin pit and scratch counts. \n \n Improvement in the NU and RMS roughness (Figure 6) is achieved by using electrostatic interactions \nto create a bond between the polymer core and the silica shell (composite B). A MRR higher than 300 \nnm/min. is achieved using composite B with 5wt.% 300 nm polymer core - 90 nm silica shell, 5 wt% 300 \nnm polymer core - 15 nm silica shell, and 5wt% 300 nm polymer particles in the presence of 10-4 M \nCTAHS. The use of surfactants during copper CMP is particularly attractive due to the effect of MRR \nenhancement that allows polishing with softer abrasives such as polymer particles. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6. a) Thickness removed, b) Sum of defects, and c) RMS Roughness vs. composite B/pmma abrasive type. \n \n \n 520\n \n 459\n \n 128 115\n \n 0\n \n 100\n \n 200\n \n 300\n \n 400\n \n 500\n \n 600\n \n Sil 600 5% Coll 90 5% Coll 30 5% Coll 15 5%\n \n Slurry\n \n T\nh\n \n ic\nk\n \n n\ne\n \n ss\n r\n \n e\nm\n \n o\nve\n \n d\n (n\n \n m\n)\n \n 405\n \n 354\n \n 126\n \n 532\n \n 0\n \n 100\n \n 200\n \n 300\n \n 400\n \n 500\n \n 600\n \n Sil 600 5% Coll 90 5% Coll 30 5% Coll 15 5%\n \n Slurry\n \n S\nu\n \n m\n o\n \n f d\nef\n \n e\nct\n \n s\n \n a 5.8\n \n 2 1.9 1.7\n \n 0\n \n 1\n \n 2\n \n 3\n \n 4\n \n 5\n \n 6\n \n 7\n \n Sil 600 5% Coll 90 5% Coll 30 5% Coll 15 5%\n \n Slurry\n \n R\nM\n \n S\n R\n \n o\nu\n \n g\nh\n \n n\nes\n \n s \n(n\n \n m\n)b              c \n \n  \n \n 0\n \n 5\n \n 10\n \n 15\n \n 20\n \n 25\n \n 30\n \n 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000\n \n x (nm)\n \n z \n(n\n \n m\n)\n \n a \n \n 161\n203 222\n \n 480\n \n 220\n \n 309\n \n 54\n \n 469\n \n 0\n \n 100\n \n 200\n \n 300\n \n 400\n \n 500\n \n 600\n \n B\n 6\n \n 00\n/9\n \n 0 \n5%\n \n B\n 6\n \n 00\n/3\n \n 0 \n5%\n \n B\n 6\n \n 00\n/1\n \n 5 \n5%\n \n B\n 3\n \n 00\n/9\n \n 0 \n5%\n \n B\n 3\n \n 00\n/3\n \n 0 \n5%\n \n B\n 3\n \n 00\n/1\n \n 5 \n5%\n \n pm\nm\n \n a3\n00\n \n pm\nm\n \n a3\n00\n \n +C\nT\n \n A\nH\n \n S\n \n Slurry\n \n T\nh\n \n ic\nkn\n \n e\nss\n \n  R\nem\n \n o\nve\n \n d\n (n\n \n m\n)\n \n 812 262 481\n \n 29056\n \n 723 1223 252\n \n 21095\n \n 0\n \n 5000\n \n 10000\n \n 15000\n \n 20000\n \n 25000\n \n 30000\n \n 35000\n \n B\n 6\n \n 00\n/9\n \n 0 \n5%\n \n B\n 6\n \n 00\n/3\n \n 0 \n5%\n \n B\n 6\n \n 00\n/1\n \n 5 \n5%\n \n B\n 3\n \n 00\n/9\n \n 0 \n5%\n \n B\n 3\n \n 00\n/3\n \n 0 \n5%\n \n B\n 3\n \n 00\n/1\n \n 5 \n5%\n \n pm\nm\n \n a3\n00\n \n pm\nm\n \n a3\n00\n \n +C\nT\n \n A\nH\n \n S\n \n Slurry\n \n S\nu\n \n m\n o\n \n f d\nef\n \n ec\nts\n \n 0.9\n \n 0.6\n \n 0.8 0.8\n \n 1\n \n 1.2\n \n 0\n \n 0.2\n \n 0.4\n \n 0.6\n \n 0.8\n \n 1\n \n 1.2\n \n 1.4\n \n B\n 6\n \n 00\n/9\n \n 0\n5%\n \n B\n 6\n \n 00\n/3\n \n 0\n5%\n \n B\n 6\n \n 00\n/1\n \n 5\n5%\n \n B\n 3\n \n 00\n/9\n \n 0\n5%\n \n B\n 3\n \n 00\n/3\n \n 0\n5%\n \n B\n 3\n \n 00\n/1\n \n 5\n5%\n \n Slurry\n \n R\nM\n \n S\n R\n \n o\nu\n \n g\nh\n \n n\nes\n \n s \n(n\n \n m\n)\n \n a b              c  \n  \n \n   \n The cationic surfactant CTAHS acts in synergy with the chemicals in the slurry composition \nimproving the material removal mechanism with increased lubrication. This leads to better NU after \npolishing (< 4%). Unfortunately the presence of particles sticking to the wafer surface after the post-CMP \ncleaning step increases the defect number to ca. 21000. In addition, the RMS roughness and the AFM \nimages of the copper surface after polishing with the polymers in the presence of CTAHS reveal a surface \ncompletely covered by polymer particles. \n \n As already said for composite A, larger polymer cores lead to a low defect count, while the presence \nof the largest 90 nm colloidal silica at the shell increases the defect number.  In Figure 7 a, b , and c the \n3D AFM images of the copper surface after polishing with composite B abrasives for decreasing \ndiameters of the colloidal silica in the shells are shown. The surface damage and scratch/pit depths are \nlower for the smaller size silica particles.   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7. 3D AFM images of the copper surface after CMP with the model slurry chemical composition and a) B \n600-90 5wt%, b) B 600-30 5wt%, and c) B 600-15 5wt% \n \n \n Copper CMP with a soft pad. The effect of the soft Politex pad using the same model slurry chemistry \nalready described for the CMP experiments done with the harder IC-1000 pad and the composite \nabrasives, has been investigated.  \n \n While for the IC-1000 pad a 2 min. diamond conditioning step was foreseen before each polishing run, \nthe Politex pad was rinsed for 1 min. with DI water coming from a high pressure spray gun.  In this case, \nto validate the effectiveness of this procedure, 10 wafers were processed with 5wt.% composite B \nabrasives in the model slurry chemistry and the MRR monitored. A drop in the MRR would indicate pad \nsurface deterioration as a consequence of a non-optimal conditioning step and the presence of polishing \nresidues in the pad asperities. No drop in the MRR (ca. 450 nm/min.) was observed, the NU was also \nconstant and below 6%, and the defect level maintained below 6000 counts.   \n \n Three different polymer core sizes (277, 365, and 432 nm) were investigated and combined with 30 \nnm colloidal silica to form the composites A and B. 360 nm polymer particles and 30 nm silica colloids \nwere compared to the composites in terms of MRR and defectivity. The MRR values of both composites \nA and B are comparable (Figure 8 a).  In both cases an increase in the MRR is observed for the largest \npolymer core size. The surprisingly small MRR reported for the composite A with intermediate core size \nis explained by a non-systematic experimental error due to an inefficient stirring of the slurry \n \n   \n \n 0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n \n 10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n \n 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000\n \n x (nm)\n \n z \n(n\n \n m\n)\n \n a \n \n  \n \n 0\n \n 1\n \n 2\n \n 3\n \n 4\n \n 5\n \n 6\n \n 7\n \n 8\n \n 9\n \n 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000\n \n x (nm)\n \n z \n(n\n \n m\n)\n \n b \n \n  \n \n 0\n \n 0.5\n \n 1\n \n 1.5\n \n 2\n \n 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n \n x (nm)\n \n z \n(n\n \n m\n)\n \n c  \n  \n \n   \n composition. As a consequence, after polishing the three wafers, we noted the presence of a dense \nabrasive mass deposited on the bottom of the slurry container. Therefore, the effective abrasive solid \ncontent in the slurry was much smaller than the claimed 5wt.% leading to a MRR more than 4 times \nsmaller with respect to the expected MRR. In addition, using a soft pad, the MRR observed for \ncomposites A and B with a larger core size almost doubles the MRR value found for the 30 nm colloidal \nsilica.  \n \n Figure 8 b presents the total defect counts after CMP with composites A and B with increasing \npolymer core size. For composite B the defectivity is halved going from the smallest polymer core size to \nthe maximum latex diameter. For composite A with the largest core size the photodetector of the SP1DLS \nwent into overload due to the high defect number. This unexpected result has been justified in terms of \nthe very broad size distribution of the composite particles, as revealed by SEM investigation on samples \ncollected after CMP (insert in Figure 8.26 c).  A map of the defects after polishing with composite B is \nshown as insert in Figure 8.26 c. The defects are mainly localized at the wafer edge and a pattern can be \nrecognized especially in one half of the wafer area. This pattern can be attributed to the Mirra-Mesa brush \ngeometry. \n \n To test the stability of the coverage of the composites in the slurry chemistry during the CMP process, \nSEM investigation was performed before and after CMP. The results are shown in Table 5.  For all the \ncomposites, the coverage is not disrupted by the shear forces and chemistry during the 1 min. polishing \nand the particles show stability during the CMP process.  \n \n In summary, using a soft pad in combination with the composite abrasives allows the achievement of \nMRR that can reach 600 nm/min. MRR enhancements can be obtained using larger polymer cores for \nboth composites A and B.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 8. a) MRR, and b) sum of defects for: D02-D04 polished with composite A core 278 nm, D05-D07 polished \nwith composite A core 365 nm, D08-D010 polished with composite A core 432 nm, D11-D13 polished with \ncomposite B core 278 nm, D14-D16 polished with composite B core 365 nm, D17-D19 polished with composite B \ncore 432 nm, D20-D22 polished with colloidal silica 30 nm. \n \n  \n \n 381\n400 414\n \n 96 98 86\n \n 561 575\n608\n \n 437 423 416 404 418 413\n \n 525 538 519\n \n 331 331 327\n \n 0\n \n 100\n \n 200\n \n 300\n \n 400\n \n 500\n \n 600\n \n 700\n \n D02 D03 D04 D05 D06 D07 D08 D09 D10 D11 D12 D13 D14 D15 D16 D17 D18 D19 D20 D21 D22\n \n R\nR\n \n C\nM\n \n  (n\nm\n \n /m\nin\n \n )\n \n 10151\n \n 13633\n \n 7377\n5388\n \n 9399\n \n 12047\n9767\n \n 11006\n \n 4058\n \n 12750\n \n 4735527342283323\n \n 12899\n \n 26068\n \n 27240\n \n 23799\n \n 0\n \n 5000\n \n 10000\n \n 15000\n \n 20000\n \n 25000\n \n 30000\n \n 35000\n \n D02 D03 D04 D05 D06 D07 D08 D09 D10 D11 D12 D13 D14 D15 D16 D17 D18 D19 D20 D21 D22\n \n Wfr #\n \n S\nu\n \n m\n o\n \n f d\ne\n \n fe\nct\n \n s\n \n a \n \n b  \n  \n \n   \n Table 5.

The average size of \nthe core is also indicated. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \nCONCLUSIONS  \n \n \n In this work the role of abrasive particles properties during the copper CMP process was investigated. \nIn particular, the final purpose was to assess if the composite polymer core \u0096 inorganic shell system could \nbe a promising direction for copper/low-κ slurry development and design. A model slurry chemistry \nbased on the synergy between a complexing agent (Gly), an oxidizer (H2O2), and a corrosion inhibitor \n(BTA) has been used in combination with composite polymer core \u0096 silica/ceria shell abrasives of various \nsizes. The effect of an increasing oxidizer concentration (from 0.1vol.% to 10vol.%) on the polishing \nperformances of the composite abrasives was also investigated. Copper rip-out types of defects similar to \nthe ones detected on the wafer surface after CMP in pure model slurry chemistry, were observed for low \noxidizer concentration, while shallow scratches and cracks develop for higher oxide layer thicknesses. \n \n Experimental data for copper CMP experiments using two kinds of pad of different hardness have \nbeen also presented. When a medium-high hardness pad is used, for the colloidal silica particles the MRR \nincreases with abrasive size. Copper polishing with polymer colloids is very promising in improving the \nsurface finish, if an optimized chemistry is combined in the slurry formulation. In particular, the addition \nof surfactants such as CTAHS is helpful in increasing the MRR. Unfortunately, in this case the presence \nof a huge amount of polishing debris, polymer particles and surfactant residues on the copper surface after \nthe post-CMP cleaning in DI water made it impossible to draw any conclusions in terms of the impact of \nthe surfactant on defectivity and surface finish.  \n \n Remarkably superior surface quality was observed after polishing with composite B with respect to \npure silica and composite A. The most frequent defect type associated with composite A is pitting and the \nmeasured depth of the holes reaches 80 nm. In addition, a substantial RMS roughness reduction was \nnoted after polishing with composite B and a maximum scratch depth of 20 nm was measured for the \nlargest diameter silica particles in the shell.  \n \n A soft pad interacts with the soft composite particles in a completely different mode compared with a \nmedium/high hardness pad. First of all, after polishing with a soft pad the overall number of defects is \nmuch lower than the total defects counted in the case of a harder pad.  Furthermore, in the former case, \nthe difference between the two composites both in terms of MRR and defectivity is less marked. An \nincrease in the defect count is registered for smaller polymer cores with respect to the larger ones.  \n \n  \n \n BEFORE CMP AFTER CMP \nCore \nsize \n(nm) \n± St. \nDev. \n(nm) \n \n COMPOSITE A \nCOMPOSITE B COMPOSITE A COMPOSITE B \n \n 277.5 \n± 9.0 \n \n     \n \n 364.6 \n± \n \n 15.4 \n \n     \n \n 431.9 \n± \n \n 31.8 \n \n     \nS\n \n IZ\nE\n \n   \n  \n \n   \n   \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n \n The authors wish to thank J.

    {"values":"Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to evaluate the extent of liquid phase formation in particle compacts (compressed dry powders) comprised of organically capped nano-scale Ag particles and Sn. The Ag nanoparticles employed where synthesized with various organic molecules and procedures to produce particles with a range of capping thicknesses and decomposition temperatures (Td), as measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). A baseline sample containing commercially available un-capped micrometer scale Ag was also investigated for comparison. Results indicate that all of the Sn initially present formed a liquid phase when heated through its melting point when combined with Ag particles exhibiting a comparatively thick cap of low Td. Slightly smaller fractions of Sn liquid were obtained when the Ag's cap was thin and of a high Td while particles with thin-low Td caps exhibited the highest levels of Sn consumption and similar to that observed with the un-capped micron-scale Ag particles. The reduction in the amount of Sn liquid formed is attributed to solid state reaction between the Ag and Sn particles resulting in the formation of a more refractory phase. The extent of the subsequent liquid phase reaction was also evaluated and is demonstrated to not necessarily be adversely effected by the presence of the organics. The significance of this work is the demonstration that organic molecules may be employed to prevent solid state reaction in particle compacts at elevated temperatures, yet allow the subsequent liquid phase reaction proceed uninhibited."    },

The Ag nanoparticles employed where synthesized with various organic molecules and procedures to produce particles with a range of capping thicknesses and decomposition temperatures (Td), as measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). A baseline sample containing commercially available un-capped micrometer scale Ag was also investigated for comparison. Results indicate that all of the Sn initially present formed a liquid phase when heated through its melting point when combined with Ag particles exhibiting a comparatively thick cap of low Td. Slightly smaller fractions of Sn liquid were obtained when the Ag's cap was thin and of a high Td while particles with thin-low Td caps exhibited the highest levels of Sn consumption and similar to that observed with the un-capped micron-scale Ag particles. The reduction in the amount of Sn liquid formed is attributed to solid state reaction between the Ag and Sn particles resulting in the formation of a more refractory phase. The extent of the subsequent liquid phase reaction was also evaluated and is demonstrated to not necessarily be adversely effected by the presence of the organics. The significance of this work is the demonstration that organic molecules may be employed to prevent solid state reaction in particle compacts at elevated temperatures, yet allow the subsequent liquid phase reaction proceed uninhibited. \n (Received April 30 2008) \n (Accepted May 01 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t differential thermal analysis (DTA);  \n\t bonding;  \n\t powder processing \n

,"description":"Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to evaluate the extent of liquid phase formation in particle compacts (compressed dry powders) comprised of organically capped nano-scale Ag particles and Sn. The Ag nanoparticles employed where synthesized with various organic molecules and procedures to produce particles with a range of capping thicknesses and decomposition temperatures (Td), as measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). A baseline sample containing commercially available un-capped micrometer scale Ag was also investigated for comparison. Results indicate that all of the Sn initially present formed a liquid phase when heated through its melting point when combined with Ag particles exhibiting a comparatively thick cap of low Td. Slightly smaller fractions of Sn liquid were obtained when the Ag's cap was thin and of a high Td while particles with thin-low Td caps exhibited the highest levels of Sn consumption and similar to that observed with the un-capped micron-scale Ag particles. The reduction in the amount of Sn liquid formed is attributed to solid state reaction between the Ag and Sn particles resulting in the formation of a more refractory phase. The extent of the subsequent liquid phase reaction was also evaluated and is demonstrated to not necessarily be adversely effected by the presence of the organics. The significance of this work is the demonstration that organic molecules may be employed to prevent solid state reaction in particle compacts at elevated temperatures, yet allow the subsequent liquid phase reaction proceed uninhibited.","coins":   [

    {"values":"In our previous studies, thin Ti-rich diffusion barrier layers were found to be formed at the interface between Cu(Ti) films and SiO2/Si substrates after annealing at elevated temperatures. This technique was called  which is attractive for fabrication of ultra-large scale integrated (ULSI) interconnects. In the present study, we investigated the applicability of this technique to Cu(Ti) alloy films which were deposited on the four low dielectric constant (low-k) dielectric layers which are potential dielectric layers of future ULSI-Si devices. The microstructures were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and correlated with the electrical properties of the Cu(Ti) films. It was concluded that the Ti-rich interface layers were formed in all the Cu(Ti)/dielectric-layer samples. The primary factor to control composition of the self-formed Ti-rich interface layers was the C concentration in the dielectric layers rather than the formation enthalpy of the Ti compounds (TiC and TiSi). Crystalline TiC was formed on the dielectric layers with a C concentration higher than 17 at.%."    },

This technique was called \u201cself-formation of the diffusion barrier,\u201d which is attractive for fabrication of ultra-large scale integrated (ULSI) interconnects. In the present study, we investigated the applicability of this technique to Cu(Ti) alloy films which were deposited on the four low dielectric constant (low-k) dielectric layers which are potential dielectric layers of future ULSI-Si devices. The microstructures were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and correlated with the electrical properties of the Cu(Ti) films. It was concluded that the Ti-rich interface layers were formed in all the Cu(Ti)/dielectric-layer samples. The primary factor to control composition of the self-formed Ti-rich interface layers was the C concentration in the dielectric layers rather than the formation enthalpy of the Ti compounds (TiC and TiSi). Crystalline TiC was formed on the dielectric layers with a C concentration higher than 17 at.%. \n (Received May 01 2008) \n (Accepted May 01 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t barrier layer;  \n\t annealing;

,"description":"In our previous studies, thin Ti-rich diffusion barrier layers were found to be formed at the interface between Cu(Ti) films and SiO2/Si substrates after annealing at elevated temperatures. This technique was called  which is attractive for fabrication of ultra-large scale integrated (ULSI) interconnects. In the present study, we investigated the applicability of this technique to Cu(Ti) alloy films which were deposited on the four low dielectric constant (low-k) dielectric layers which are potential dielectric layers of future ULSI-Si devices. The microstructures were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and correlated with the electrical properties of the Cu(Ti) films. It was concluded that the Ti-rich interface layers were formed in all the Cu(Ti)/dielectric-layer samples. The primary factor to control composition of the self-formed Ti-rich interface layers was the C concentration in the dielectric layers rather than the formation enthalpy of the Ti compounds (TiC and TiSi). Crystalline TiC was formed on the dielectric layers with a C concentration higher than 17 at.%.","coins":   [

    {"values":"Direct current (D.C.) is usually employed to characterize the electromigration reliability of interconnects. However, D.C. characterization techniques might not reflect the actual reliability of interconnects that are carrying pulsed D.C. or A.C. (alternating current) signals during operation. This study investigates the effects of unipolar and bipolar pulsed current on the electromigration lifetime of copper (Cu) interconnects. A series of long period pulsed current (i.e. 2, 16, 32 and 48 hours) were applied to Cu interconnects. Lifetime enhancement is observed when the half-period of pulsed current is shorter than the medium-time-to-failure (t50) of D.C. stressed samples. Minor increase in resistance occurring in-between pulses for unipolar pulsed current stressed samples, and occurrence of damage healing in bipolar pulsed current stressed samples are reasons attributed for the observed enhanced lifetime. We obtained longer MTF when the period of the pulsed current is shorter."    },

However, D.C. characterization techniques might not reflect the actual reliability of interconnects that are carrying pulsed D.C. or A.C. (alternating current) signals during operation. This study investigates the effects of unipolar and bipolar pulsed current on the electromigration lifetime of copper (Cu) interconnects. A series of long period pulsed current (i.e. 2, 16, 32 and 48 hours) were applied to Cu interconnects. Lifetime enhancement is observed when the half-period of pulsed current is shorter than the medium-time-to-failure (t50) of D.C. stressed samples. Minor increase in resistance occurring in-between pulses for unipolar pulsed current stressed samples, and occurrence of damage healing in bipolar pulsed current stressed samples are reasons attributed for the observed enhanced lifetime. We obtained longer MTF when the period of the pulsed current is shorter. \n (Received March 18 2008) \n (Accepted April 29 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t electromigration;  \n\t Cu;  \n\t microelectronics

,"description":"Direct current (D.C.) is usually employed to characterize the electromigration reliability of interconnects. However, D.C. characterization techniques might not reflect the actual reliability of interconnects that are carrying pulsed D.C. or A.C. (alternating current) signals during operation. This study investigates the effects of unipolar and bipolar pulsed current on the electromigration lifetime of copper (Cu) interconnects. A series of long period pulsed current (i.e. 2, 16, 32 and 48 hours) were applied to Cu interconnects. Lifetime enhancement is observed when the half-period of pulsed current is shorter than the medium-time-to-failure (t50) of D.C. stressed samples. Minor increase in resistance occurring in-between pulses for unipolar pulsed current stressed samples, and occurrence of damage healing in bipolar pulsed current stressed samples are reasons attributed for the observed enhanced lifetime. We obtained longer MTF when the period of the pulsed current is shorter.","coins":   [

It connects various process assumptions directly to electrical \nparameters including resistance.  The resistance of narrow copper lines is becoming a \nchallenging parameter, not only in terms of controlling its value but also understanding the \nunderlying mechanisms.  The resistance was measured for 45nm-node interconnects and \ncompared to the theory of electron scattering.  This work will demonstrate how valuable it is to \ndirectly link the electrical models to the physical on-wafer dimensions and in turn to the process \nassumptions.  For example, one can generate a tolerance pareto for physical and or electrical \nparameters that immediately identifies those process sectors that have the largest contribution to \nthe overall tolerance.  It also can be used to easily generate resistance versus capacitance plots \nwhich provide a good BEOL performance gauge.  Several examples for 45nm BEOL will be \ngiven to demonstrate the value of these tools. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n \n When a new technology node gets introduced to its development phase there is typically \nlittle or no silicon data.  In this concept stage most of the technology definition and elements are \ntherefore based on assumptions.  One considers the learning from prior technologies as well as \nnew material and process candidates that are presented by the research community.  The result is \na set of assumptions that best describes what is expected to happen on wafer for each of the \nprocessing steps.  This set is commonly referred to as the process assumptions.  As real silicon \ndata becomes available it can be used to update and refine the process assumptions. \n \n This work describes how to set up the process assumptions and directly link it to \nelectrical models.  The result is a valuable tool that can be used to evaluate various BEOL \noptions and to validate a BEOL technology. \n \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1079 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1079-N02-01 \n  \n \n   \n SETTING UP BEOL PROCESS ASSUMPTIONS \n \nCapturing processing details \n  \n Each processing step on the wafer can be captured by a schematic and a simple set of \nequations.  Figure 1 shows an example for metal 1 where the contact module is followed by a \ndielectric deposition, lithography and etch. \n \n \n D\n \n resist\n \n OE H\n \n  \nFigure 1:  Schematic of how metal 1 could be formed.  In this case metal 1 is formed by the \ndeposition of single dielectric film and patterning using lithography and etch. \n \nThe metal 1 dielectric deposition thickness is indicated by D.  To build in adequate overetch the \nRIE team targets a thicker film: E. Assuming the etch selectivity to the dielectric in the contact \nmodule is s, the following expressions are obtained for the overetch OE and the line height H \nafter metal 1 etch: \n \n  ( )DEOE s −= 1        (1) \n ( ) EDH ss 111 +−=        (2) \n \n \n It is tempting to write the line height as H=D+OE which is of course correct, but D and OE are \nnot independent parameters. Hence, one cannot use this equation to calculate the tolerances.  \nEquation 2 has independent process parameters (D and E) and can be RSSed (Root of the Sum of \nthe Squares) to compute the tolerances in H. \n Although the deposition and etch processes are independent in this example, their target \nvalues have to be set consistently of course.  Not only with respect to each other, but also \nconsistent with the technology targets that need to be achieved.  One can continue to capture the \nnext set of processes (and modules) and write the various line and via dimensions as function of \nthe independent process parameters.  With these equations it is then possible to solve for some or \neven all of the process targets by using the technology (final on-wafer) targets and constraints.  \nFor example, one constraint could be to set the worst-case metal 1 overetch to 20%.  Figure 2 \nshows the process flow schematically.  \n  \n \n   \n Other process targets \n(not part of input)\n \n Final (on-wafer) \ntolerances\n \n Electrical targets and \ntolerances\n \n Calculate:\n \n Other process targets \n(not part of input)\n \n Final (on-wafer) \ntolerances\n \n Electrical targets and \ntolerances\n \n Calculate:\n \n Target Dimensions\n \n Process Tolerances\n \n Minimum set of \nprocess targets / \n \n constraints\n \n Input:\n \n Target Dimensions\n \n Process Tolerances\n \n Minimum set of \nprocess targets / \n \n constraints\n \n Input:\n \n  \nFigure 2:  Schematic of how the process assumptions can be setup. The left box indicates the \ninput which includes the target (or final on-wafer) dimensions.  The right side indicates the \ninstantaneous feedback from simple calculations \n \nThis setup is very powerful and can easily be implemented in a spreadsheet such as Excel.  It \nautomatically adjusts the various process targets when a change is made in target dimensions and \nor/tolerances.  The whole set of process assumptions is self-consistent. \n \nIncluding electrical models \n  \n Electrical models can also be incorporated in the flow that is shown in Figure 2.  Perhaps \nthe most difficult parameter is the resistance of narrow Cu lines.  The Cu resistivity starts to \nincrease as the interconnect dimensions approach the electron mean free path in Cu.  This \nphenomena has been studie since the 1940s [1-3].  The most conventional and elegant approach \nis to solve the Boltzmann transport equation. Although detailed knowledge of the scattering \ninteractions is not required in this case, the values of certain scattering parameters still have to be \ndetermined by experimental data. We follow the work of Steve Rossnagel who has looked in \ndetail at these scattering parameters. The electron mean free path in Cu is assumed to be 39nm. \nThe  other two scattering parameters are p=0.1-0.3 and R=0.3 for surface and grain boundary \nscattering, respectively.  We will discuss the choice of scattering parameters and experimental \ndata in a separate publication [4]. \n Figure 3a shows a cross-sectional TEM of a 45nm BEOL Cu wire of known resistance.  \nThe Boltzmann equation can be solved for this particular geometry and results in a Cu \nconductivity profile which is shown in Figure 3b.  The resistance is then obtained as the \nreciprocal value of the conductivity integral and is in good agreement with the measured \nresistance.  These rather complicated profiles are of course hard to work with in the process \nassumptions.  A profile as drawn in Figure 3c) is more desirable.  Fortunately, the modeled \nresistance of the rectangular profile is very similar to one in Figure 3b).  Please note that the \nprofiles in Figure 3 have the same Cu area and width at half-height.  \n \n Before resistance can be included in the process assumptions flow (Figure 2), one more \nsimplification is required.  Instead of solving the Boltzmann equation which is rather time-\nconsuming, a closed expression is required. For extreme cases (wire dimensions much larger \nthan the electron mean free path) the following expression can be derived [3]  \n \n \n ⎥\n \n ⎦\n \n ⎤\n \n ⎢\n \n ⎣\n \n ⎡\n \n −+⎟\n⎠\n \n ⎞\n \n ⎜\n \n ⎝\n \n ⎛ +−+≈\ngR\n \n R\n \n wh\n \n w\np\n \n λλρρ\n1\n \n 4.11)1(1 830     (3)  \n  \n \n   \n   \n a) b)                      c)\n \n \n Figure 3:  Cross-sectional TEM of a 45nm BEOL wire (a), modeled conductivity profile (b), \nmodeled conductivity profile for rectangular cross section with same Cu area and width at half-\nheight (c). \n \nwhere ρ is the Cu resistivity, ρ0 the bulk resistivity, λ the electron mean free path and g the \naverage Cu grain size. \n Figure 4 shows Cu resistivity data as function of the Cu width at half-height.  The data \nwas obtained by measuring the resistance of various wires (different levels/wafers/lots). The Cu \nresistivity was then calculated by multiplying it with the Cu cross-sectional area as determined \nby TEM.  The solid green line shows the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation.  The \ngrain size g is assumed to be proportional to the linewidth w.  The agreement between the two is \nvery good.  At the smaller Cu dimensions (~50nm), the deviation is 3-4%.  This is still small \ncompared to the spread in the experimental data (appr. ±5%). Note that this data is also \nconsistent with a bulk Cu resistivity of 1.71 µΩ-cm. \n \n Capacitance of BEOL wiring levels is typically obtained by using a field solver and is \nrather time consuming.  In order to include capacitance calculations into the process assumptions \nflow, the parameter space was mapped with a field solver and fit by a simple function.  This is \nvery similar to what is for done extraction decks and accuracy within 1-2% is easily obtained. \n \nTolerance Pareto \n  \n The first section explained how the final on-wafer dimensions can be expressed as \nfunction of the individual process parameters.  The resistance and capacitance can be expressed \nas function of these process parameters as well.

The assumptions for the significant unit process sectors are listed next \nto the bars.  The etch rate of the metal trench is 15%.  Litho control the metal CD within 8.5%.  \nThe removal by CMP has a relatively large tolerance of 60%.  The sidewall angle of the trench \nhas a tolerance of 0.5° and the dielectric deposition has a tolerance of 10%.  In this example, the \netch depth is the largest contributor to the variation in capacitance and an effort to reduce this \nvariation should therefore focus on improving the etch depth control.  The reason that CMP \nranks lower in the pareto despite having the largest (relative) tolerance is that total thickness \nremoved by CMP is smaller than the etched depth in this example. \n    \n  \n \n   \n 0%\n \n 10%\n \n 20%\n \n 30%\n \n 40%\n \n 50%\n \n RIE (15%)\n \n Litho CD\n(8.5%)\n \n CMP\n(60%)\n \n Sidewall \nangle \n(0.5°)\n \n ILD\n(10%)\n \n  \nFigure 5:  Capacitance tolerance pareto for a metal 2 wire at 45nm node. The numbers in \nparentheses indicate the unit process tolerances which were made up for this example. \n \n \n One last note for the resistance tolerance pareto. Resistance is a non-linear parameter as it \nis inversely proportional to the Cu area and RSS is therefore not appropriate to calculate the \nresistance tolerances.  The Cu area is the the product of the Cu height and width and therefore \nnon-linear as well.  However, compared to resistance the area is better behaved and more \nnormally distributed then the resistance as will be shown later.  It is therefore a fair assumption \nto assume that the Cu area and reciprocal resistance is normally distributed.  Instead of RSS-ing \nthe resistance and calculating the resistance pareto this way, it is better to calculate the Cu area \ntolerance pareto (which is identical to the resistance tolerance pareto). \n \n   \n \n DISCUSSION  \n \nUsing the process assumptions as a tool to compare integration schemes \n  \n The tolerance pareto is a useful tool when comparing different integration schemes.  To \nillustrate this, the examples in Figure 6a) and b) were made up.  The stack highlighted in a) \nrepresents a conventional metal 2 stack in an ILD that does not have a hardmask when it enters \nthe CMP sector.  The stack in b) integrates a lower dielectric constant film that does require a \nhardmask and the assumption is made that it needs to be polished off to obtain the lowest keff \npossible.  The additional hardmask in the second stack requires a larger etch depth and a larger \nCMP removal.  The assumption was made that tolerances for litho CD, etch depth and CMP \nremoval are the same for both integration schemes: 7%,  8% and 30%, respectively.  For this \nexample, we further assumed that the hardmask required is quite thick: ~40nm.  The final target \ndimensions are assumed to be 150nm tall and 70nm wide.  By following the flow outlined in \nFigure 2, the tolerances are immediately obtained for the two stacks. The metal 2 resistance has a \ntolerance of ~15% without hardmask, but a ~30% with hardmask.  As the paretos indicate, \nvariation in the CMP sector has become the dominant contributor to the resistance tolerances \nwhereas the RIE and litho CD tolerances have fallen to second and third place.   \n \n Again, the stacks and tolerances in Figure 6a) and b) were made up to illustrate the use of \nthe tolerance pareto.  The increased resistance tolerances with the hardmask can of course be \naddressed by minimizing the hardmask thickness as well as increasing the polish selectivity \nbetween the hardmask and the ILD.  \n  \n \n   \n   \n 0%\n \n 10%\n \n 20%\n \n 30%\n \n 40%\n \n 50%\n \n 60%\n \n 70%\n \n Litho RIE CMP Other\n \n 0%\n \n 10%\n \n 20%\n \n 30%\n \n 40%\n \n 50%\n \n 60%\n \n 70%\n \n CMP RIE Litho Other\n \n Hardmask\n \n Resistance Tolerance Pareto Resistance Tolerance Pareto\n \n Removed by CMP\n \n a)                                         b)\n \n \n Figure 6:  Comparison of two integration schemes:  a) ILD without hardmask,  b) ILD with \nhardmask. \n \nResistance versus capacitance \n  \n Resistance is often plotted versus capacitance.  In this section it will be shown that the \nlocation of the RvsC curve is quite \u2018universal\u2019 and provides a good measure  whether or not the \ndielectric constants and Cu volume of the wires are on target. \n When a random generator is added to the process flow in Figure 2 it is very easy to \nproduce an expected RvsC curve as is demonstrated in Figure 7.  The shape and location of this \ncurve can now be instantaneously be verified by changing the input assumptions. Changes in line \nheight and width move the datapoints along the curve.  Changes in liner thickness do not impact \nthe capacitance and the RvsC cloud is expected to move to lower or higher resistance values.  In \ncontrast, changes in via height and dielectric constants do not impact resistance and the RvsC \ncloud now moves to higher or lower capacitance values.  Since only a third of the capacitance \nconsists of vertical coupling, large changes in viaheight are required to significantly move the \nRvsC cloud to different capacitance values. \n  \n  \n \n   \n Resistance\n \n C\nap\n \n ac\nita\n \n nc\ne\n \n Line width \n& height\n \n Dielectric constant \n& via height\n \n Liner volume \nfraction\n \n  \n \n Figure 7:  Resistance vs capacitance plots and dependency on various parameters. \n \n Figure 7 was generated by assuming a trapezoidal shape for the metal wires. In reality, \nhowever, the profiles can be a lot more complicated as is shown in Figure 3a). To verify the \nimpact of a more complicated shape, wires were considered where the bottom of the wire has an \nincreased taper angle.  A few random cases were generated which nominally had the same width \nat half-height and liner volume fraction as the wires in Figure 7.  The capacitance was calculated \nby using a field solver and the resistance was obtained by solving the Boltzmann transport \nequation.  The results are shown in red and compared to the trapezoidal shapes in Figure 8. \n \n \n Resistance\n \n C\nap\n \n ac\nita\n \n nc\ne\n \n  \n \n Figure 8:  Resistance vs capacitance plots for two different profiles. \n  \n  \n \n   \n This simulated data confirms the earlier statement where the location of the RvsC curve \ndepends mostly on the dielectric constants of the various films in the stack and the Cu volume \nand resistivity.  This property is quite useful.  Early silicon data is typically off target for both \nphysical dimensions as well as electrical properties.  However, when the resistance is plotted \nversus resistance, the RC cloud should intersect or approach the technology target, at least within \na few percent. \n \n Figure 9 shows a RvsC comparison of experimental data for a 45nm interconnect in an \nultra-low k dielectric [5] and simulated data for a dielectric constant of 2.4 and 3.0. The location \nof the RvsC clouds validate that the assumptions of k=2.4 and Cu volume and resistivity were \nmet. The shape of the RvsC cloud (thickness and width) are determined by the process \ntolerances.  One cannot validate each process tolerance, but the shape of the cloud should be \nconsistent with the whole set of tolerances.  \n \n  \n \n Resistance\n \n C\nap\n \n ac\nita\n \n nc\ne\n \n 45nm ULK data\nRC simulation (k=2.4)\nRC simulation (k=3.0)\n \n ~15%\n \n  \n \n \n Figure 9:  45nm ULK RvsC data compared to process assumptions for k=2.4 and k=3.0.   \n \nFigure 10 shows experimental RvsC data for two 45nm populations which differ in liner \n \n thickness as can be seen from the two TEMs. The thinner liner shifts the RvsC cloud to lower \nresistances as indicated by the solid black arrow.  The wire dimensions for the blue population , \nhowever, were adjusted to maintain similar resistance values compared to the red population.  \nThe adjustment in cross sectional area is indicated by the dashed black arrow.  The net change is \na drop of 8% in capacitance.  This data demonstrates that the liner thickness is an important \nparameter for the interconnect performance.  Care must be taken that new dielectrics are not \nintroduced at the expense of a thicker liner.  \n  \n  \n \n   \n Resistance\n \n C\nap\n \n ac\nita\n \n nc\ne\n \n ~8%\n \n ~13%\n \n  \nFigure 10:  45nm ULK RvsC data for two different liner thicknesses and line dimensions. \n \nIncluding reliability considerations \n  \n As the dimensions continue to shrink it has become a real challenge to meet reliability \nrequirements for interconnects.  Reliability considerations therefore have to be included when \nsetting up process assumptions. This section demonstrates how time-dependent dielectric \nbreakdown (TDDB) and electro-migration (EM) have competing demands that cannot be ignored \nduring the definition phase of a BEOL interconnect technology. \n Figure 11 shows EM data for the via-depletion mode for two populations that have 70nm \nwide wires with different via sizes.  Each of the distributions is clearly bimodal, but this is \nbeyond the scope of this discussion. Focusing simply on the t50, a reduction of 37% is observed \nwhen the via size is reduced from 80 down to 70nm. \n \n \n 1\n \n 5\n \n 10\n \n 25\n \n 50\n \n 75\n \n 90\n \n 95\n \n 99\n \n 99.9\n \n e\nlitn\n \n ecr\neP\n \n Log Normal Probability Plot\n \n C\n \n Time to fail\n \n 1\n \n 5\n \n 10\n \n 25\n \n 50\n \n 75\n \n 90\n \n 95\n \n 99\n \n 99.9\n \n e\nlitn\n \n ecr\neP\n \n Log Normal Probability Plot\n \n C\n \n Time to fail\n \n ~70nm ~80nm\n \n e-e-\n \n  \n \n Figure 11:  Electro-migration data for 45nm interconnects with 70 and 80nm via sizes.  \n  \n \n   \n  \nWhile EM favors a larger via, TDDB stressing of large dense viachains shows that an \n \n increase in via CD results in a significant reduction in the projected lifetimes (~100-1000x !).  \nThis effect is illustrated by the diagrams in Figure 12.  The diagram in Figure 12a) represents the \n70nm vias. As the bottom CD is increased from 70 to 80nm, Figure 12b, the top of the vias \nincrease accordingly and increases the electric field and the chance for catastrophic breakdown. \nThe operating voltages have not been keeping pace with the shrink factors between technology \nnodes.  This increases the burden on process integration to improve the spacing control between \ndifferent nets and keep the worst-case electric field at an acceptable level. \n \n  \n \n topv\n \n topvtopv\n \n botv\n \n topv'\n \n Post-CMP \nplane\n \n topv' topv'\n \n a)                                  b) c)\n \n botv botv botv botvbotv'botv'\n \n topv'\n \n  \nFigure 12:  Schematics illustrating how the top CD increases due to larger bottom CDs (b) or \nnew dielectric films that may be more prone to strip damage or RIE challenges at the via \n \n  \nFigure 12c) shows what could happen as a lower-k dielectric material is introduced. \n \n These films may be more prone to sidewall damage due various plasma exposures. Higher \ncarbon-content in the film may also result in different etch characteristics that alter the profile \nnear the via bottom. Assuming we want to keep the bottom on target, these two effects would \nresult in larger top CDs and may therefore compromise TDDB performance. \n \n  \nProcess Capability \n \n Many chip fabrication plants have been raising their standards when it comes to process \ncapability. Typically Cp/Cpk calculations assume normal distributions. However, non-linear \nparameters such as resistance should be approached carefully.  Figure 13a) shows the resistance \nhistogram and a normal fit for 45nm resistance data. It does not look so bad at first glance, but \nFigure 13b) shows otherwise. The solid red line is a fit to the blue datapoints assuming the \nresistance is normally distributed and a poor match is obtained at the tails of the distribution.  \nSince the resistance is inversely proportional to the Cu area, one can get a better fit by assuming \nthe area and, in turn, 1/resistance is normally distributed.  As the solid green line shows a much \nbetter fit is obtained.  \n \n To highlight the importance for process capability, a hypothetical reliability spec limit is \nplaced as indicated by the red dashed line. This spec limit could, for example, correspond to a Cu \narea which is too small to support the currents used in the designs. The process capability as \nextracted from a single sided Cpk would be significantly different for the two different fits (R \nnormal and 1/R normal): 1.5 versus 1.1. \n \n bottom (c).   \n  \n \n   \n   \n -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4\n \n z\n \n R\ne\n \n si\nst\n \n a\nnc\n \n e\n \n R normal\n \n Target\n \n Spec limit\n \n 1/R normal\n \n Target Spec limitTarget Spec limit\n \n a)                                                              b)  \n  \nFigure 13: 45nm resistance data: a) histogram, b) distribution with a normal and non-normal fit. \n \n \n CONCLUSIONS \n \n \n It has been shown how the process assumptions can directly link the unit processes to the \nelectrical targets and tolerances.  The process assumptions can be made self-consistent by \nimplementing proper constraints. The result is a tool where one can change final on-wafer target \ndimensions and unit process tolerances and get immediate feedback on physical tolerances and \nelectrical parameters. A tolerance pareto calculation was added to identify those processes that \nhave the largest impact on the overall tolerance. The tool can also be used to generate resistance \nversus capacitance curves. It has been shown that the location of these curves are rather \ninsensitive to the wire dimensions and therefore a good performance gauge for the dielectric \nconstants in the BEOL stack as well as the Cu area and resistivity. The Cu resistivity is a \ncomplex parameter and depends on electron scattering at surface and grain boundaries. \nExperimental data from 45nm and simple models were found to be in good agreement. \n \n \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n \n This work has been supported by the independent Bulk CMOS and SOI technology \ndevelopment projects at the IBM Microelectronics, Div.

Mn was selectively oxidized at the surface by annealing in Ar gas containing an impurity level of O2 (<0.01ppm). Resistivity of the film was decreased to 2.0 μΩcm after annealing. On the other hand, internal oxidation of Cu-Mn alloy was observed with no external protective surface oxide layer in Ar containing more than 10 ppm of O2. An optimum oxygen concentration is found to be in between 0.01 and 10 ppm in 1atm of Ar gas at 350 °C. \n (Received March 13 2008) \n (Accepted April 29 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t barrier layer;  \n\t

,"description":"Optimum conditions of annealing atmosphere and temperature for the reduction of Mn content from the Cu-Mn alloy layer in Cu-Mn self-forming barrier process were investigated. Mn was selectively oxidized at the surface by annealing in Ar gas containing an impurity level of O2 (<0.01ppm). Resistivity of the film was decreased to 2.0 cm after annealing. On the other hand, internal oxidation of Cu-Mn alloy was observed with no external protective surface oxide layer in Ar containing more than 10 ppm of O2. An optimum oxygen concentration is found to be in between 0.01 and 10 ppm in 1atm of Ar gas at 350 °C.","coins":   [

    {"values":"Plasma modification of SiOCH low-k films is analyzed by means of Molecular Mechanics. It is shown that the most probable mechanism of SiOCH modification in He plasma is removal of hydrogen atoms from CH3 groups. The change of SiSi bond angles depends on the amount of the formed CH2OOO chain. The end of this chain gets bound to its beginning through NH2. This process is the reason of pore sealing."    },

It is shown that the most probable mechanism of SiOCH modification in He plasma is removal of hydrogen atoms from CH3 groups. The change of Si\u2013O\u2013Si bond angles depends on the amount of the formed \u2013CH2* (CHx) groups. During the followed exposure in NH3 plasma, NH2* radicals bind CHx groups with Si forming a \u2013CH2\u2013 Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2013 chain. The end of this chain gets bound to its beginning through NH2. This process is the reason of pore sealing. \n (Received September 03 2008) \n (Accepted October 09 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t dielectric;  \n\t plasma deposition;  \n\t infrared (IR) spectroscopy \n

,"description":"Plasma modification of SiOCH low-k films is analyzed by means of Molecular Mechanics. It is shown that the most probable mechanism of SiOCH modification in He plasma is removal of hydrogen atoms from CH3 groups. The change of SiSi bond angles depends on the amount of the formed CH2OOO chain. The end of this chain gets bound to its beginning through NH2. This process is the reason of pore sealing.","coins":   [

E. \nBrown Engineering Bldg., MS 3122, College Station, TX, 77843-3122 \n \nABSTRACT \n \n \n The electromigration performance of Cu lines patterned by a Cl2 plasma-based etch \nprocess has been studied with the accelerated isothermal lifetime test. An electromigration \nactivation energy of 0.6 eV and a current density acceleration exponent of 2.7 were obtained. \nBoth the copper-silicon nitride cap layer interface and the copper grain boundary were active \ndiffusion paths. The applied mechanical bending stress changed the electromigration void \ndistribution in the film, which leaded to the shorter lifetime and lower activation energy.   \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n \n Electromigration (EM) is one of the most critical reliability issues for modern ultra large \nscale integrated (ULSI) circuits due to the aggressive decrease of interconnect dimension and the \nsubsequent very large current density [1]. Copper (Cu) interconnects are typically patterned by a \ndamascene process, using the chemical mechanical polishing method to remove the Cu film \noutside of the dielectric trench. Recently, Kuo and Lee reported a new plasma-based Cu etch \nprocess [2, 3]. Instead of vaporizing the plasma/Cu reaction product formed in Cl- or Br-based \nplasma exposure, a dilute hydrogen chloride solution was used to dissolve the reaction product of \nCuClx or CuBrx. EM studies on the damascene Cu line showed that it had a lifetime one or two \norders of magnitude longer than that of the aluminum (Al) line.[1] However, the EM \nperformance of the Cu lines patterned by the plasma-based etch process has not been explored.  \n \n The EM induced failure occurs due to the flux divergence. Microscopic divergence can \nhappen at a triple junction point of the grain-boundary network or any other location where the \ninhomogenous mass transport occurs [4]. Macroscopic divergence may occur at the bottom of \nvia for the two-level testing structure where the via or the barrier layer blocks the EM flux, or the \ninterface between Cu and the cap layer where the interfacial diffusion is the primary transport \nmechanism [5]. It is necessary to identify the diffusion path and to determine the activation \nenergy (Ea) of the EM failure process before the Cu line\u0092s reliability can be understood. \nPreviously, a wide range of Ea values were reported due to different diffusion mechanisms. For \nexample, the lattice diffusion corresponded to an Ea value of 2.1 eV and the grain boundary \ndiffusion showed an Ea value of 1.2 eV [6]. For Cu metallization, the surface or interface \ndiffusion is often the primary failure mechanism. Proost reported the Ea value of 1.06 eV for the \nCu-metal interface diffusion [7]. An Ea value between 0.6 and 0.88 eV was reported on the Cu-\ndielectric interface diffusion mechanism [8].  \n \n The EM performance depends not only on the film structure, but also the patterning \nprocess. Fillipi et al. compared the EM tests of the AlCu lines fabricated by damascene process \nand the reactive ion etching (RIE) process. The damascene lines showed a longer lifetime than \nthe RIE lines. Although both processes showed a similar value of Ea, the current density \nacceleration exponent was close to 2 for the damascene structure and close to 1 for the RIE\u0092d \nstructure [9]. Most Cu lines reported in literature were fabricated by the damascene process. In \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1079 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1079-N09-02 \n  \n \n   \n this paper, authors reported the EM performance of the Cu lines patterned by the Cl2 plasma-\nbased etch process.  \n \nEXPERIMENTAL \n \n \n Single level test lines were prepared on the multilayer Cu (800 nm)/Ta (10 nm)/SiNx/Si \nfilm, using a Cl2 plasma-based etch process. The Ta layer was used as a diffusion barrier for the \nCu film. The EM line was 800 um long and 7 um wide resembling NIST straight line with 4 \nKelvin contact pads. The Cu film was patterned the photoresist, followed by a Cl2-based plasma \netch process. The detailed Cu film etch process was described in [2]. A silicon nitride layer was \ndeposited by a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process at 300°C to cover \nthe patterned Cu lines and prevent Cu oxidation during the EM tests. The silicon nitride layer at \nthe probe contact pad area was etched off with a dilute buffered oxide etch solution. \n \n The EM test system was built around a probe station (Signatone s-1160) with a hot chuck \nwith the temperature control capability. The isothermal EM test was conducted with a feedback \ncontrol loop that adjusted the current to the Cu line so that the effective temperature of the test \nline was kept within a narrow error band of the test temperature, Ttest. The algorithm followed the \nprinciples of JESD61. The temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), obtained prior to the EM \ntest, was used to estimate the temperature of the test line. The current was applied from a \nprogrammable power source and the voltage drop along the test line was measured by a digital \nmultimeter. The EM test stopped when the resistance increased more than 5%. The Cu line after \nEM was pictured with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Planar views were obtained after \nthe passivation SiNx cap layer was removed by a dilute HF solution. The SEM observations \nprovided qualitative information on the microstructure of the tested lines. \n  \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS \n \nStatistical EM Performance \n \n The activation energy ( aE ) and the current density acceleration factor ( n ) are usually \nexpressed by the Black equation.  \n \n  )exp(\nkT\n \n E\n \n J\n \n A\nMTTF a\n \n n\n=       (1) \n \n where MTTF, J, and k are median time to failure, current density and Boltzmann\u0092s constant, \nrespectively. A  is a normalization time depending on the geometry and microstructure of the test \nline. From equation (1), we obtain  \n kTEJnAMTTF a /)ln()ln()ln( +−=    (2) \nThe value of n  can be obtained by the linear regression of ln(MTTF) vs. ln(J) at the same test \ntemperature. The value of aE  can be obtained by the linear regression of [ln(MTTF)+nln(J)] vs. \n \n 1/kT once the value of n is known. \nSince the temperature and the current density were coupled in the isothermal EM test, the \n \n EM tests could be conducted at the same Cu temperature of 350ºC but different chuck \ntemperatures, e.g., 20ºC, 46ºC, and 74ºC, respectively. In such cases, the current density varied \nfor the same Ttest. The n value of 2.7 was obtained. It is generally considered that the n value \nshould lie between 1 and 2. For void-growth limited failure, the n value was reported to be close \nto 1 while for nucleation limited failure it should be close to 2 [1]. For an n value greater than 2,  \n  \n \n   \n it may exist a thermal gradient during the EM test. For the Cu lines in this test, the SEM \nobservations showed that the voids were randomly distributed along the length. However, during \nvoid growth, the temperature increases locally in the vicinity of the void. From the Black \nequation, the underestimated temperature leads to an overestimation of the n value. Similarly, the \nn value increased with the current density due to the increase of Joule heating [10]. Therefore, \nthe isothermal EM here resulted in a larger n value than the conventional EM test. \n \n Figure 1 shows the cumulative failure distribution of Cu lines at the test temperatures \nfrom 320°C to 380°C. The times to failure (TTF) follow a log-normal distribution with the \nstandard deviation σ  between 0.19 and 0.30. Although these σ  values are larger than those \nobtained from two-level test structure [11], they are comparable to the value obtained from the \nsingle level damascene test lines [12]. For the two-level structures, failure occurs in or adjacent \nto vias which are the weakest regions. For the single level structure, failure is more sensitive to \nCu film microstructure and interface. The value of σ  becomes large when more than one failure \nmechanisms exist in the test structure.  \n \n ATTF (s)\n103 104 105\n \n %\n F\n \n ai\nlu\n \n re\n \n 1.0\n \n 10.0\n \n 30.0\n \n 50.0\n \n 70.0\n \n 90.0\n \n 99.0\n \n 15.8\n16\n \n 16.2\n16.4\n16.6\n16.8\n \n 17\n17.2\n \n 17.5 18 18.5 19 19.5 20\n \n 1/kT\n \n ln\n(M\n \n T\nT\n \n F\n)+\n \n n*\nln\n \n (J\n)\n \n Ea = 0.60 eV\n \n Ttest= 320ºC\nσ = 0.19\n \n Ttest= 350ºC\nσ = 0.30\n \n Ttest= 380ºC\nσ = 0.28\n \n ATTF (s)\n103 104 105\n \n %\n F\n \n ai\nlu\n \n re\n \n 1.0\n \n 10.0\n \n 30.0\n \n 50.0\n \n 70.0\n \n 90.0\n \n 99.0\n \n 15.8\n16\n \n 16.2\n16.4\n16.6\n16.8\n \n 17\n17.2\n \n 17.5 18 18.5 19 19.5 20\n \n 1/kT\n \n ln\n(M\n \n T\nT\n \n F\n)+\n \n n*\nln\n \n (J\n)\n \n Ea = 0.60 eV\n \n Ttest= 320ºC\nσ = 0.19\n \n Ttest= 350ºC\nσ = 0.30\n \n Ttest= 380ºC\nσ = 0.28\n \n  \nFigure 1. Cumulative failure distribution of Cu lines. The inlet is the linear regression of \n[ln(MTTF) + n*ln(J)] vs. 1/kT, using n =2.7. \n \n \n The inset of Fig. 1 shows the linear regression of [ln(MTTF) + n ln(J)] vs. 1/kT using \n7.2=n . The aE value of 0.6 eV was obtained. There are four possible diffusion paths in the Cu \n \n structure: lattice, grain boundary, Cu/Ta interface, and Cu/SiNx interface. As discussed in the \nIntroduction section, the lattice and the grain boundary diffusion generally show a high aE  \n \n value, i.e., larger than 1.2 eV. The Cu-barrier metal interface diffusion shows a higher aE value \nthan that of the Cu-dielectric interface diffusion because the former has a stronger adhesion force \nthan the latter. The strength of adhesion affects the void nucleation and growth rate induced by \nEM. The PECVD SiNx cap layer usually adheres weakly to the Cu layer. In addition, the large \ndifference of the thermal expansion coefficients between Cu and the dielectric film weakens the \ninterface in the EM test at high temperature [13]. Ea value of 0.65 eV was reported for Cu line \nwith PECVD SiNx cap layer [14]. The aE  value of 0.6 eV in this study indicated the Cu-SiNx \ncap layer interfacial diffusion may be the primary transport mechanism. \n \nFailure analysis \n \n It is well established that the basic requirement for EM to occur in an interconnect  \n  \n \n   \n structure is the existence of flux divergence of metal atoms due to the electronic driving force.  \nThe atomic flux Γ at i-grain boundary can be expressed as follow. \n \n i\ni\n \n ii\ni qEZkT\n \n DN φcos*=Γ      (3) \n \n where N, D, qZ *  are the atomic concentration, diffusion coefficient, and effective charge of the \n \n ions, iφ  is the inclination angle of the i-th grain boundary with respect to the electron flow. The \nflux divergence at a triple junction point is ∑Γi , which is zero only when the relative angle \nbetween two adjacent grain boundaries is 120° [15]. However, due to the variation of the grain \nsize, this particular condition is hardly met. A non-zero divergence at the triple junction point \nleads to an accumulation or void. As illustrated in Figure 2(a), if 321 Γ+Γ<Γ , the void is formed \nby the divergent flux along the grain boundaries. In such a case, the void at the early stage should \nhave a triangle shape. Fig. 2(b) and (c) show the typical voids formed on the Cu line after EM at \n350°C for 150 and 350 seconds, respectively. The voids were not due to the removal of the \npassivation layer, because no similar voids on the adjacent dummy lines were observed. \nAlthough Fig. 2(b) and (c) were from different lines, the voids presented at the similar location, \ni.e., the triple junction point of grain boundaries. Therefore, the void initiated from the grain \nboundary junction point and grew larger as the EM continued.  \n \n \n  \nFigure 2. Illustration (a) and SEM images of void formation after EM at 350ºC for (b) 150 \nseconds; (c)350 seconds. \n \n \n Mass transport occurs not only along the grain boundary, but also along the interface. Cu \natoms that are migrating along the upper Cu surface or Cu/dielectric interface are fed by two \nmechanisms: the Cu diffusion from inside of the metal line to the top surface along the grain \nboundaries or the grain thinning, as illustrated in Fig. 3(a). When the Cu atoms are depleted from \nthe grain boundary or the inner free surface of the void that intersects the top Cu surface, the \nvoid tends to grow in a \u0093v\u0094 shape. In such a case, the void grows wider and deeper with EM \ntime. For grain thinning, the surface atoms on the upstream grain diffuse to the void boundary, \nand then move up the step to feed the atoms that flow at the Cu/dielectric interface [4]. In this \ncase the void leads to the flat upstream surface. Fig. 3(b) shows the top view of the Cu line after \nEM at 350°C for 2400 seconds and the removal of SiNx. The recess areas in Fig. 3(b) correspond \nto the voids at the Cu-SiNx interface, which were due to the interfacial diffusion. Both grain \nboundary depletion voids and grain thinning voids were observed. The voids caused by grain \nthinning should have less impact on the line resistance change than the voids caused by grain \nboundary depletion because the lower-stream grains are still connected in the former situation. \nHowever, since both kinds of voids exist at the same time, it is hard to differentiate them from \nthe resistance-time plot.  \n \n   \n  \n \n   \n Cu\n \n void\n \n Grain thinning\n \n Top surface/ interface\n \n 2 um\n \n (a)\n \n (b)\n \n Cu\n \n void\n \n Grain thinning\n \n Top surface/ interface\n \n Cu\n \n void\n \n Grain thinning\n \n Top surface/ interface\n \n 2 um\n \n (a)\n \n (b)\n \n Grain thinning\n \n Grain boundary depletion\n \n  \nFigure 3. Illustration and SEM image of voids by grain thinning and grain boundary depletion\n \n  \nExternal bending stress effect on EM \n \n To investigate the mechanical stress effect on EM, a series of EM tests were performed \non the mechanically bended Cu lines. The patterned Cu sample was cut into a 2 x 2 cm plate, \nwhich was placed on the three-point bending Al holder on the hot chuck. The stress was caused \nby the mechanical bending and could be roughly estimated. Here, it is bout 85MPa, which is far \nmore than the internal stress without mechanical bending. The MTTFs of the bended lines are \nshorter than those of the non-bended lines at 320ºC and 350ºC, i.e., 8852s and 4944s vs. 11711s \nand 6000s, respectively. At 380ºC, the MTTFs of the bended and non-bended lines are \ncomparable, i.e., 3320s vs. 3278, because the initial bending stress effect is less significant due to \nthe increased thermal stress. Using n= 2.7, the Ea value of 0.5 eV was obtained, which is smaller \nthan the Ea without bending stress, i.e., 0.6 eV. Similar activation energy shift was reported on \nCu damascene lines with compressive stress being applied [16]. In the EM test, the resistance \nchange is a complex collective behavior of the void growth and nucleation. After EM test, \nnumerous voids were observed along the length. There is noticeable difference in the voids \ndistribution between the bended and non-bended lines. For example, in the non-bended line, the \nconsecutive voids tended to line up along the current flow, as shown in Figure 4 (a). However, in \nthe bended lines, the consecutive voids tended to line up perpendicular to the current flow, as \nshown in Fig. 4(b). \n \n   \n \n  \nFigure 4. Typical void distribution in (a) non-bended line, (b) bended line of EM at 350ºC.  \n \nIn a simplified mode, assuming the total volume of the voids are comparable for the bended and \nnon-bended lines, the resistance change in a conductor of overall length L and width W is given \nby the following equation:  \n \n  \n \n )1\n)(\n \n (\n)(\n \n 0\n \n −\n−\n \n ×=∆\ntwW\n \n W\n \n L\n \n tl\n \n R\n \n R\n    (4) \n \n at 350ºC.  \n  \n \n   \n )(tl  and )(tw are equivalent overall void length and width, respectively. From equation (4), the \nvoids aligned perpendicular to the current flow play a larger impact on the resistance change than \nthe equaxied voids do. Therefore, the line with the void distribution in Fig. 4(b) would have a \nshorter lifetime. Although equation (4) was based on a simplified model, more detail study and \nsimulation on the void morphology showed the similar result [17]. Therefore, the applied \nbending stress affected the void distribution and shortened the EM lifetime.  \n \n  \nCONCLUSION \n \n The isothermal electromigration tests were performed on the single level Cu interconnect \nlines prepared from a Cl2 plasma based etch process. An activation energy of 0.6 eV and a \ncurrent density exponent of 2.7 were obtained. The SEM pictures showed that voids were \ninitiated from the grain boundary junction points and grew preferentially along grain boundaries. \nBoth the Cu-SiNx interface and the Cu grain boundary diffusion were critical to the EM failure. \nThe Cu lines with the bended compressive stress showed a shorter lifetime and lower activation \nenergy than the unbended lines due to the change of void distribution.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \n \n The authors would like to thank Helinda Nominanda for the SiNx cap layer deposition \nand Yu Lei for the technical discussion during the photolithography mask design.  \n \n \n REFERENCES: \n[1] C.

Extracted diffusion coefficients for \nthe bulk were in line with literature values.  In order to simulate the experimentally derived \ndiffusion profiles at temperatures where bulk diffusion is not the dominant diffusion mechanism \n(room temperature to 350 °C), it was necessary to explicitly include the re-distribution of Al as a \nresult of Cu grain growth during anneal.  Aluminum has the tendency to segregate to the Cu/liner \nand Cu/etch stop (ES) interface.  The tendency of Al to segregate to the liner is ten times \nstronger for ruthenium (Ru) than for tantalum (Ta).  In 100 nm wide dual damascene structures \nlined with Ru, this segregation behavior was responsible for the Al depletion in bulk Cu and for \nthe Al depletion at the Cu/ES interface. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n \n To meet the increasing feature-density requirements of future technology nodes, the \ndimensions of copper (Cu) dual damascene interconnects must be continuously scaled.  Since the \ncurrent density increases with shrinking feature size, Cu lines become more and more prone to \nelectromigration-induced failure.  The electromigration resistance of Cu can be improved \nthrough doping with elements such as Ag, Sn, and Al [1-3].  Relatively little is known about the \nfundamental diffusion properties of these dopants in polycrystalline Cu thin films and about the \ndopant distribution in Cu dual damascene structures.  In the present study, we report on the \ndiffusion mechanism of aluminum (Al) in Cu thin films.  To understand the experimentally \nderived Al diffusion profile in terms of grain boundary diffusion, bulk lattice diffusion and grain \nsize evolution during anneal, secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) depth profiles of Al-\ndoped Cu thin films were complemented with continuum simulations.  Aluminum segregation to \nthe Cu/ES interface and to two technologically relevant liner materials, tantalum/tantalum nitride \n(Ta(N)) and tantalum nitride/ruthenium (TaN/Ru), were first investigated for simple planar \nstacks.  The results are then compared with the spatial distribution of Al in Cu-filled trenches. \n \n \n EXPERIMENT \n \n All samples were fabricated in state-of-the-art 300 mm barrier/seed deposition tools with \nintegrated degas and pre-clean capability, an electroplating tool and a CVD etch stop deposition \ntool.  Figure 1 (a) shows the blanket wafer film stack used in this study.  The bottom interface \nconsisted of a PVD Ta(N) based barrier or a TaN/Ru bi-layer, respectively.   \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1079 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1079-N04-06 \n  \n \n   \n A 200 Å thick PVD Cu-Al layer was sandwiched between two 1000 Å thick PVD Cu layers.  \nThe total Al dose in the stack was on the order of 7x1015 atoms/cm2.  Symmetrical diffusion \nstacks were capped either with a Ta or Ru cap, whereas non-symmetrical stacks were capped \nwith a silicon carbide/nitride ES layer.  Annealing experiments as a function of time were \nconducted in forming gas in a vertical diffusion furnace that was kept at the desired anneal \ntemperature.  Samples were introduced through a load lock.  Figure 1 (b) shows a schematic of \nthe corresponding dual damascene structures.  Dual damascene structures were prepared using \nstandard PVD Ta(N) barrier and seed deposition, and were subsequently plated with a state-of-\nthe-art EP Cu process, chemically-mechanically polished and capped with a silicon \ncarbide/nitride etch stop layer. \n \n Si\n \n SiO2\n \n X = Ta(N) or TaN/Ru\n \n PVD Cu\n \n PVD Cu-Al\n \n X = Ta(N), Ru or ES\n \n ES\n \n (a) (b)\n \n PVD Cu\n \n Cu-Al\n \n X = Ta(N) or TaN/Ru\n \n Inter Layer Dielectric\n \n Si\n \n SiO2\n \n X = Ta(N) or TaN/Ru\n \n PVD Cu\n \n PVD Cu-Al\n \n X = Ta(N), Ru or ES\n \n ES\n \n (a) (b)\n \n PVD Cu\n \n Cu-Al\n \n X = Ta(N) or TaN/Ru\n \n Inter Layer Dielectric\n \n  \nFigure 1.

(b) Dual damascene structures \ndoped with Al. \n \n \n SIMS measurements were done with a SC-Ultra SIMS instrument.  A 1.5KeV Cs+ \nprimary beam was used and positive secondary cluster ions (Cs+, Cs16O+, CsAl+ and Cs63Cu+) \nwith an energy of 5keV were collected at low mass resolution (~300) [4].  For SIMS on \npatterned structures, large 1 x 0.5 mm test fields were used that consisted of 100 nm wide Al-\ndoped Cu trenches of uniform pitch, width and orientation.  Additionally, the Al concentration in \nCu lines was measured with a field emission gun transmission electron microscope equipped \nwith a detector for energy dispersive X-ray analysis (FE TEM/EDX). The spatial resolution is \napprox. 1nm and approx. 1% Al can be detected within the analyzed volume. \n \nDISCUSSION \n \n The evolution of Al depth profiles with time of symmetrical stacks with a Ta cap is \nshown in Fig. 2 for several characteristic temperatures 20°C, 150°C, 350°C and 450°C.  At \n450°C, Fig 2 (a), the Al source layer broadens symmetrically.  When the anneal temperature is \nlowered to 350°C, Fig. 2 (b), little broadening of the source layer is observed, however, diffusion \ntails develop and saturate after approximately 5 minutes.  At 250 °C (results are not shown) \nsaturated diffusion tails form after 20 minutes of anneal, whereas at 150°C (Fig 2(c)) even after \n80 minutes of anneal no saturation of the diffusion tails is reached.  The concentration of the  \n  \n \n   \n saturated tails is essentially independent of the anneal temperature and at saturation about half of \nthe total Al dose is contained in the tail plateaus.  Even at room temperature, Fig 2 (d), the Al \nsource layer is far from being stable.  Significant formation of diffusion tails is observed after 2 \nmonths.  At all temperatures, Al segregation to the Ta liner material takes place.  While the \nsegregation of Al to the Ta liner (bottom) and Ta cap (top) is symmetrical for low anneal \ntemperatures, the extent of segregation becomes increasingly asymmetrical when the anneal \ntemperature is raised with more Al segregating to the top Ta interface than to the bottom Ta \ninterface, see Fig 2 (a) - (d).  The asymmetry of the Al segregation is not completely understood \nat this point. \n \n \n 1E+16\n \n 1E+17\n \n 1E+18\n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\nDepth (A)\n \n co\nn\n \n c.\n (\n \n at\n/c\n \n m\n3 )\n \n 450C\n5min\n \n 20min\n \n 80min\n \n 0min\n \n 1E+16\n \n 1E+17\n \n 1E+18\n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\nDepth (A)\n \n co\nn\n \n c.\n (\n \n at\n/c\n \n m\n3 )\n \n 450C\n5min\n \n 20min\n \n 80min\n \n 0min\n \n 1E+16\n \n 1E+17\n \n 1E+18\n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\nDepth (A)\n \n co\nn\n \n c.\n (\n \n at\n/c\n \n m\n3 )\n \n 350C\n \n 5min\n20min\n \n 80min\n \n 0min\n \n 1E+16\n \n 1E+17\n \n 1E+18\n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\nDepth (A)\n \n co\nn\n \n c.\n (\n \n at\n/c\n \n m\n3 )\n \n 350C\n \n 5min\n20min\n \n 80min\n \n 0min\n \n 1E+16\n \n 1E+17\n \n 1E+18\n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n \n Depth (A)\n \n co\nn\n \n c.\n (\n \n at\n/c\n \n m\n3 )\n \n 150C\n \n 5min\n20min\n \n 80min\n \n 0min\n \n 1E+16\n \n 1E+17\n \n 1E+18\n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n \n Depth (A)\n \n co\nn\n \n c.\n (\n \n at\n/c\n \n m\n3 )\n \n + 2 months\n \n as deposited\n \n + 4 months\n \n (a) (b)\n \n (c) (d)\n \n  \n \n Figure 2.  Evolution of SIMS depth profiles of Al in PVD Cu stack for various anneal \ntemperatures and anneal times (0, 5, 20 and 80 minutes).  The stack was annealed at (a) 450°C, \n(b) 350°C, and (c) 150 °C. (d) PVD Cu stack at room temperature as deposited and after 2 & 4 \nmonths of ageing. \n \n \n To understand the re-distribution of Al from a source layer as a function of temperature \nand time, continuum simulations were employed that treat Al diffusion as transport inside grains \n(bulk diffusion) and along grain boundaries [5].  Values for the bulk and grain boundary \ndiffusivities were taken from the literature [6-7].  Rapidly saturating grain growth during anneal \nwas taken into account by including an empirical rate constant in the simulation.  This rate \nconstant was treated as a single exponential growth process with a characteristic time constant.  \n  \n \n   \n Simulated Al diffusion profiles at 350°C are shown in Figure 3. Since grain boundary \ndiffusivity is orders of magnitude greater than bulk diffusivity [6-7] and grain boundary volume \nincreases with decreasing grain size, the redistribution of Al is facilitated by small grain sizes.  \nFor a somewhat unrealistically small grain size of 50 Å, Fig. 3 (a), simulations predict, that the \nsource layer diminishes quickly with time.  Due to the small Cu grain size, the average diffusion \npath that Al experiences before it encounters a grain boundary is short and dopants are thus \nquickly transported away by high-diffusivity grain boundaries.  A film with grain size of 5000 Å, \nwhich is on the same order of magnitude as the total film thickness used in this report, exhibits \nno saturation of the tail concentration and little loss of Al from the source layer is observed, see \nFig 3(b).  Although the diffusion along grain boundaries is still very rapid, the process is limited \nby the long diffusion path of Al inside the Cu bulk.  Only when the grain size is allowed to \nevolve from a smaller grain size to 5000 Å in the early stages of the simulated anneal, does the \nsimulation model fit the experimental data, see Fig. 3(c).   \n \n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0.0 0.3 0.5\n \n Depth (µm)\n \n C\no\n \n n\nc.\n \n  (a\nt/c\n \n m\n3 )\n \n 1E+18\n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0 0.25 0.5\n \n Depth(µm)\n \n C\no\n \n n\nc.\n \n  (\nat\n \n /c\nm\n \n 3 )\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0.0 0.3 0.5\n \n Depth(µm)\n \n C\no\n \n n\nc.\n \n (a\nt/\n \n cm\n3 )\n \n (a) (b)\n \n (c) (d)\n \n 5 min\n \n 20 min\n \n 80 min\n \n 20 min\n \n 80 min\n \n 5 min\n \n 5 min\n \n 20 min\n \n 80 min\n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0.0 0.3 0.5\n \n Depth (µm)\n \n C\no\n \n n\nc.\n \n  (a\nt/c\n \n m\n3 )\n \n 1E+18\n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0 0.25 0.5\n \n Depth(µm)\n \n C\no\n \n n\nc.\n \n  (\nat\n \n /c\nm\n \n 3 )\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 0.0 0.3 0.5\n \n Depth(µm)\n \n C\no\n \n n\nc.\n \n (a\nt/\n \n cm\n3 )\n \n (a) (b)\n \n (c) (d)\n \n 5 min\n \n 20 min\n \n 80 min\n \n 20 min\n \n 80 min\n \n 5 min\n \n 5 min\n \n 20 min\n \n 80 min\n \n  \nFigure 3.

The grain size is on the order of 5000 Å.  White dots are Al. \n \n   \n  \n \n   \n As Cu grains in the highly unstable as-deposited film grow, grain boundaries move \nthrough the Al-doped regions thus providing an effective path by which Al is captured inside the \ngrain boundaries.  The time needed to stabilize the grain size is represented by the time needed to \nreach saturation of the diffusion tails and this time decreases with temperature.  Since Cu grain-\ngrowth at room temperature is a well known phenomenon [8], grain-growth induced re-\ndistribution of Al at temperatures as low as room temperature is expected and was indeed \nobserved, see Fig 2 (d).  An Auger scan of a polycrystalline, Al-doped Cu thin film confirms the \ngrain size is on the order of the film thickness and that more Al resides within the grains \nboundaries than in the Cu bulk, see Figure 3 (d). \n \n The bulk diffusivity was determined by fitting the experimentally observed broadening of \nthe Al source layer for 5 - 80 min of anneal.  The bulk diffusivity values obtained for 450 °C and \n350 °C were 1.8x10-15 cm2/sec and 6.3x10-17 cm2/sec, respectively. These values are in excellent \nagreement with the literature [6-7].  For 250 °C the extraction of diffusivity is complicated due to \nthe limited broadening of the source layer and roughness-induced peak broadening during SIMS \ndepth profiling.  Since the Cu films in this report are thin and the barrier layer serves as a sink for \nAl, grain boundary diffusivities could not be extracted from the gradient of the diffusion tails. \n \n  \n \n 1E+17\n \n 1E+18\n \n 1E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 1E+21\n \n 1E+22\n \n 1000 2000 3000 4000\nDepth (A)\n \n C\no\n \n n\nce\n \n n\ntr\n \n at\nio\n \n n\n (\n \n at\n/c\n \n m\n3)\n \n TaN/Ru\n \n PVD Ta(N)\n \n 0E+00\n \n 5E+19\n \n 1E+20\n \n 2E+20\n \n 2E+20\n \n 3E+20\n \n 320 370 420 470\n \n Depth (A)\n \n C\no\n \n n\nc.\n \n  (\nat\n \n /c\nm\n \n 3 )\n \n PVD Ta(N)\n \n TaN/Ru\n \n (a) (b)\n \n  \n \n Figure 4. (a) Planar stack capped with ES material. According to SIMS depth profiling the Al \nsegregation to the Cu/Ru interface is an order of magnitude larger than the segregation at \nCu/Ta(N) interface. (b) Al concentration at the Cu/ES interface for a large assembly of patterned \ntrenches as measured by SIMS.  \n \n \n Diffusion profiles are further influenced by the presence of the interface material.  For a \nnon-symmetrical PVD Cu stack capped with ES material, Fig. 4 (a) depicts the segregation of Al \nto a Ta(N)-based liner material and a Ru/TaN based liner material, respectively.  For identical \nanneal conditions, we find that a stack with a Ru liner accumulates approximately two times \nmore Al during doping than the Ta(N)-based stack.  For Ru, most of the Al segregates to the \nCu/Ru interface and the Al dose is ~10 times higher than that measured at the Cu/Ta(N) \ninterface.  In Fig 4 (a), the Al conc. at depth of 1000 A represents the bulk concentration of Al in \nthe particular stack.. The bulk concentration in the Ta(N) stack is about 5 times larger than the Al \nbulk concentration in the Ru/TaN stack.  For planar stacks both liner materials exhibited similar \namounts of Al at the Cu/ES interface.  \n  \n \n   \n In order to understand the distribution of Al in real interconnect structures in the light of \nthis segregation behavior, dynamic SIMS measurements were conducted on dual damascene \nstructure which are depicted in Fig 1. (b). The diffusion profiles consist of an Al peak at the ES \ninterface that quickly reaches a plateau as the sputter front moves away from the Cu/ES interface \nand into the trench.  At the Cu/ES interface, SIMS detects the convoluted amount of Al at ES/Cu \ninterface, Al residing in the bulk of the Cu lines and Al that has segregated to the sidewalls.  \nInside the metal trench, only Al in the bulk and Al residing at the sidewalls are detected.  The Al \nconcentration at the Cu/ES interface can thus be determined by subtracting the Al plateau region \n(Al in the bulk + Al residing at the sidewalls) from the Al depth profile, the result of which is \nshown in Fig. 4 (b).  As a result of the strong segregation tendency of Al to the Ru sidewalls, see \nplanar stack results in Fig. 4 (a), the Al concentration at Cu/ES interface is strongly depleted with \nrespect to Al, while a healthy dose of Al is retained at the Cu/ES layer of trenches lined with \nTa(N).  These results have been independently confirmed by FE TEM/EDX line scans which \ndetect within the accuracy of the measurement technique no Al at the Cu/ES interface but Al \nsegregation to the Ru sidewalls.  The data supports the model that the main pathway for Al to \nreach the ES/Cu interface is Al diffusion across the Cu/liner interface. Al atoms are more mobile \nacross Cu/Ta(N) interface than Cu/Ru interface. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \n \n This report for the first time presents a model of Al diffusion in Cu thin films with \nexplicit consideration of Cu grain growth during anneal and the segregation tendency of Al to the \nCu/liner interface that is consistent with experimentally derived diffusion profiles.  Simple planar \nstacks were used to predict the distribution of Al in dual damascene structures. \n \n \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n \n The authors acknowledge Patrick Paluda for fab integration support of the experiments \ndescribed in this report, Gregory Scott & Janet Forsyth for their support of the SIMS \nmeasurements, and Milt Jaehnig & John Richards for help with Auger spectroscopy. \n \nREFERENCES \n \n \n 1.

The thickness of the Mn oxide layer could be \nvaried 2.6 to 10 nm depending on deposition temperature. Heat-treated samples of PVD Cu / \nCVD Mn oxide /SiO2 indicated no interdiffusion. The CVD Mn oxide was found to be a good \ndiffusion barrier layer. \n \nIntroduction \n With the increase in packing density of ultra-large scale integrated circuits, geometrical \ndimensions continue to decrease. As a width of Cu line becomes narrow, a thickness of a barrier \nlayer should be reduced to prevent the increase of the effective resistivity of the interconnect \nlines [1]. Ta and TaN have been widely used as conventional barrier materials to prevent \ninterdiffusion between Cu line and dielectric insulating layer. Physical vapor deposition (PVD) \nhave been employed as a their deposition method. The barrier layer formation with a PVD \ntechnique has become difficult as the technology node is reduced to 45 nm \n \n Without using Ta and TaN, Koike and his colleagues reported the self-formation of a diffusion \nbarrier by direct deposition of a Cu-Mn seed layer on a TEOS oxide substrate. The Mn oxide \nlayer was self-formed at the interface by annealing at elevated temperatures and acted as an \nexcellent barrier layer [2-4]. However, as in the case of the conventional Ta barrier, PVD \ndeposition of the Cu-Mn seed layer will eventually encounter the difficulty in deposition in \nnarrow trenches and vias. \n \n Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been known for its good step coverage, and is a \ncandidate technique for the formation of a barrier layer, a Cu seed layer and entire Cu line. In \norder to take advantage of the excellent reliability of Mn oxide, Mn deposition with CVD as a \nbarrier layer is expected to be very attractive process. Up to date, only a few works have been \nreported for CVD-Mn layer. Wen-bin et al. reported that the deposition of a metallic Mn layer \noccurs above the temperature of 410ºC [5]. Maruyama and Osaki reported that a Mn oxide layer \nforms above 250ºC [6]. However, it is desirable to form the Mn barrier layer with CVD at lower \ntemperatures. \n \n In this work, as a first approach of Manganese-based barrier layer formation by CVD, we \ndeposited Mn oxide films using a metal organic precursor by thermal CVD at low temperatures \nand investigated the formation behavior and diffusion barrier property of the Mn oxide films. \n \n \n Experimental procedures \nSubstrates were p-type Si wafers having a plasma TEOS oxides of 100nm in thickness. \n \n Bisethylcylopentadienyl manganese (EtCp)2Mn was used as a metal organic manganese \nprecursor. The Mn precursor was vaporized and introduced into the hot- wall reaction chamber \nwith Ar or H2 carrier gas in the thermal-CVD process. The detailed process \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc.

Following the Mn CVD, the sample was transferred to a \n PVD chamber with keeping vacuum to deposit a Cu overlayer using a DC sputtering system. \nTwo types of the samples were prepared in this study.  One is a sample without Cu overlayer to \nanalyze a chemical bonding state of the CVD-Mn layer.

A thin \ncontinuous layer is observed at the interface between Cu and SiO2 layer. The CVD-Mn layer \ndoes not show a characteristic diffraction contrast of a crystalline structure. Therefore, the CVD-\nMn layer is considered to be an amorphous structure. The CVD-Mn layer has a thickness of 3.9 \nnm. The EDX result of Fig.1 indicates that Cu, Mn, Si, O and C are detected from the CVD-Mn \nlayer. Among these elements, Cu and Si peaks are originated from the neighboring layers of Cu \nand SiO2. This is because a nominal electron beam size used for TEM-EDX analysis was 2 nm \nand is nearly the same size as the thickness of the CVD-Mn layer. Beam spread within the \nsample had lead to the overlap of the Cu and Si peaks. Thus, the CVD-Mn layer is consisted \nmainly of Mn, O and C. \n \n  \n \n     \n \nFigure 1.

The XPS results were obtained after brief etching of the \nCVD-Mn layer surface to remove surface contamination. The peak position indicates that the \nCVD-Mn layer is not metallic states but in oxide states. This result is in agreement with the \nresults of TEM and EDX.

It is \nalso found that the thickness is slightly thinner with H2 carrier gas than with Ar carrier gas. It \nshould be noted that the thickness of the Mn oxide layer is in the range of 2.6 nm to 10 nm, \nincluding the thickness values required in the ITRS road map. \n \n  \nFigure 4.

CNT via-conduits may greatly improve heat dissipation and as such \nlower interconnect resistance and improve electromigration resistance. Each carbon shell of the  \nnanotube contributes to electrical and thermal conduction and densities as high as 5x1013 shells \nper cm2 are estimated necessary. CNT growth processes on BEOL compatible metals are \npresented with tube densities up to 1012cm-2 and shell densities approaching 1013 cm-2 on blanket \nsubstrates. Selective growth of CNT bundles with carbon shell densities around 1012cm-2 is \ndemonstrated with high yield. Ohmic behavior of TiN/CNT/Ti contacts is shown with a CNT via \nresistivity of 1.2 mΩ cm.  \n \n \n INTRODUCTION \n \n \n Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are one-dimensional hollow nanostructures with extreme aspect \nratios and exceptional mechanical, thermal and electrical properties [1]. One could picture a \nCNT by rolled-up sheets of graphene: a single graphene layer forms a single-walled (SW-), a \ndouble-layer forms a double-walled (DW), and multiple layers form a multi-walled (MW) tube. \nA single CNT can be as narrow as 0.4nm for the smallest SW-CNT and several hundred  \nnanometer in diameter for MW-CNT [2]. Electrical conductance of ideal metallic CNT is \nballistic and thus independent of length in contrast to metal conductors such as copper where \nconductance is determined by electron scattering. In addition, CNT can carry extreme current \ndensities up to 109 A/cm2 compared to about 106-107 A/cm2 for (capped) interconnect lines. \nMaybe even more important for interconnect applications is the high thermal conductivity which \nis expected to be 5 to 10 times higher than copper. In this paper, the possibility to replace copper \nvia interconnects in the BEOL stack by bundles of densely-packed CNT will be presented.  \n \n A CNT bundle can be considered a series of conducting shells in parallel and its \nresistance is determined by the total number of shells in the bundle. For example, a bundle of \n \n two SW-CNT and two DW-CNT has a total of four CNT (N=4) and six shells ( 6\n0\n \n =∑\nN\n \n sCNTn ), \nwith nsCNT the number of shells in a particular CNT. For CNT with not too large diameter \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1079 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1079-N06-01 \n  \n \n   \n (d<20nm), the resistance of a single CNT shell (RsCNT) can be taken equal to the resistance of a \nsingle-walled CNT (diameter independent) and the total resistance is then given by: \n \n   \n \n ∑\n \n = 0,\n \n N\nsCNT\n \n sCNT\nbundleCNT\n \n n\n \n R\nR      .  (1)  \n \n The resistance of a CNT shell is given by: \n   \n \n   llRR phonoptphonacCNTmetallicSWquantumsCNT .., ρρ ++=    (2) \nwith a first term for the fixed quantum resistance (6.5kΩ), and two terms for acoustic and optical \nphonon scattering, respectively, which are both linear with length, l, of the CNT [3]. Similar \nresults were obtained by N. Srivastava et al [4, 5]. From best know literature values [6-8], a \nquantitative relation for equation (2) was derived: \n \n     \n \n mlV\n \n llR\nmsCNT μμ 01.02.0\n \n 650055006500\n+×\n \n ×Ω\n+×+Ω= Ω  .  (3)  \n \n Note that the term for optical phonon scattering is dependent on the voltage over the CNT \ninterconnect bundle. Based on equations (1) and (3) comparison can be made with copper and \nthe example of 9nm lines will be discussed.  \n \n From equation (1) it follows that the lowest resistance is obtained for the highest CNT \nshell density. Higher shell densities can be obtained by stacking many SWCNT closely together \nin one space than by having one MW-CNT in the same space. For example, in a box of 2.5nm by \n2.5nm one can fit fourteen SW-CNT of 0.4nm diameter with a minimum spacing of 0.34nm in a \nclose-packed arrangement compared with one 2.5nm MW-CNT with a maximum of four walls. \nThe former case represents the upper limit of stacking density with 2x1014 shells per cm2. Figure \n1 shows the variations in resistance with interconnect length for cylindrical 9nm Cu line and \nCNT bundles with two packing densities. The resistance of the CNT bundles is much less \ndependent on wire length due to the small scattering rate in CNT compared to Cu. Hence, CNT \nbundles could lower the resistance of longer interconnect structures especially for highest shell \ndensities. Unfortunately, CNT bundles as horizontal interconnect lines are currently \ntechnologically not possible and CNT bundles are only considered at the via or contact levels. \nFor very short lengths (the 9nm via would have a height of 20nm), however, the CNT resistance \nis worse than copper even for maximum packing density. Since both the delay and dynamic \npower, and thus the performance, are dominated by the interconnect capacitance and not by the \ninterconnect resistance (for typical resistance values), a reasonable increase in resistance is \ntolerable. Even so, what would be the benefit of CNT bundles when they can not match the \nresistance of the copper vias? Well, there is of course the much higher current-carrying capacity \n(2-3 orders of magnitude better than Cu) which will improve electromigration. More importantly, \nthere is the high thermal conductivity of the CNT vias that will significantly improve heat \ndissipation and as such have a beneficial impact on the resistance as well as on the \nelectromigration of the total Cu-CNT hybrid stack. N. Srivastava et al have calculated that the \nintegration of high- density CNT bundles at the via level would keep the temperature of the Cu-\nCNT hybrid stack below 300C for the 22nm NODE whereas a Cu-only BEOL stack would run at \ntemperatures above 600C [4, 5]. To keep the resistance of a few micron long CNT-via/Cu-\nline/CNT-via structure comparable to that of a Cu-only via-chain structure, an estimated CNT \nshell density of 5x1013 cm-2 or higher will be necessary. Such shell densities can be obtained by a \nclosed packed stacking of either SW-CNT with diameters between 0.4 and 1.2 nm, DW-CNT  \n  \n \n   \n with diameters between 1.08 and 1.8nm, triple-walled CNT with diameters between 1.76 and \n2.4nm, quadruple-walled CNT with diameter between 2.44 and 2.7nm and even quintuple-walled \nCNT with a diameter of 3.12nm.                              \n \n  \n \n 9nm diameter conduit\n \n 10\n \n 100\n \n 1000\n \n 10000\n \n 0.01 0.1 1 10\nlenght (um)\n \n R \n(oh\n \n m\n)\n \n R(1e13CNT/cm2), 1V\n \n R(1e13CNT/cm2); 0.1V\n \n R(1e13CNT/cm2),\nballistic\nRcu(9nm)\n \n R(2e14CNT/cm2); 1V\n \n R(2e14CNT/cm2); 0.1V\n \n R(2e14CNT/cm2),\nballistic\n \n 1013 CNT/cm2\n \n 2x1014 CNT/cm2\nballistic\n \n ballistic\n \n 0.1V\n \n 0.1V\n \n 1V\n \n 1V\n \n 9nm\n \n 9nm\n \n 9nm\n \n Cu\n \n 9nm diameter conduit\n \n 10\n \n 100\n \n 1000\n \n 10000\n \n 0.01 0.1 1 10\nlenght (um)\n \n R \n(oh\n \n m\n)\n \n R(1e13CNT/cm2), 1V\n \n R(1e13CNT/cm2); 0.1V\n \n R(1e13CNT/cm2),\nballistic\nRcu(9nm)\n \n R(2e14CNT/cm2); 1V\n \n R(2e14CNT/cm2); 0.1V\n \n R(2e14CNT/cm2),\nballistic\n \n 1013 CNT/cm2\n \n 2x1014 CNT/cm2\nballistic\n \n ballistic\n \n 0.1V\n \n 0.1V\n \n 1V\n \n 1V\n \n 9nm\n \n 9nm\n \n 9nm\n \n Cu\n \n 1013 CNT/cm2\n \n 2x1014 CNT/cm2\nballistic\n \n ballistic\n \n 0.1V\n \n 0.1V\n \n 1V\n \n 1V\n \n 9nm9nm\n \n 9nm\n \n 9nm\n \n Cu\n \n  \n \n Figure 1.

Also the ballistic limit for both densities is shown. \n \n \n Growth of densely-packed CNT carpets can be achieved by catalytic CVD directly on a \nsubstrate surface after formation of Fe, Co or Ni based catalyst nanoparticles [9]. Most growth \nstudies are done on SiO2 surfaces where SW and DW CNT with densities of 1012 cm-2 and higher \nare easily obtained after proper catalyst activation step [10-12]. By using sandwiched layers with \naluminum (which oxidize into alumina) very high densities were obtained [13]. For interconnect \napplications the CNT bundles need to be grown on metals and preferably liner materials such as \nTa, TaN and TiN. Unfortunately, the obtained CNT densities are typically lower on metal \nsubstrates [14]. At IMEC a process was developed for high-density growth on Ti-based \nsubstrates [15]. Growth of CNT bundles in via holes down to 150nm in diameter with shell \ndensities of 1012 cm-2 was demonstrated. Ohmic current-voltage characteristics were obtained for \nthe TiN/CNT/Ti contacts with a minimum equivalent resistivity of 1.2mΩ cm.                                       \n \n \n RESULTS and DISCUSSION \n \n \n CNT growth on blanket substrates: effect of catalyst activation  \n  \n \n  Figure 2a shows a cross-sectional SEM image of a densely packed CNT carpet grown \nfrom a 0.5nm Fe film deposited with ion-beam sputtering on top of Ti(5nm)/SiO2/Si wafers. \nSince the wafers had been exposed to air for considerable time before Fe deposition, the actual \nstack was Fe/TiO2/Ti on SiO2. Catalyst activation was done right before growth by treatment in \nhydrogen plasma (1 Torr H2, 200W high-frequency plasma) at 650C for 5 minutes. Growth was \nachieved by thermal CVD (same chamber) in 1 Torr acetylene (C2H2) at 650C. Growth of \ndensely aligned and straight CNT was observed with a length of 28um for 60min of deposition. \nFigure 2b shows a high-resolution TEM image of a single CNT plucked from the CNT mat. The  \n  \n \n   \n CNT diameter was typically between 6 and 8 nm with 7 to 10 shells per CNT. The carbon \ndensity of the CNT film was estimated at 0.43g/cm3 by simulation of the X-ray reflectivity \n(XRR) spectra. From the measured carbon density, an average CNT diameter of 7nm, and an \naverage of 8 shells per CNT, the density of tubes was estimated 9x1011 cm-2 and thus \napproaching 1013 shells per cm2.  \nPlasma activation of the catalyst was found to be a crucial factor for growth and determined both \nthe CNT density and growth rate, under similar growth conditions. In the absence of plasma \n(thermal activation in H2 only) sparse growth was observed. Conversely, extended plasma \nactivation times also degraded growth as the catalyst material was eroded away. When the \ncatalyst activation conditions were changed to 4 Torr H2, 300W low-frequency plasma for the \nsame time (5 minutes), the CNT density dropped by a factor of 10 while the growth rate \nincreased by a factor of 10 as compared with the CNT in figure 2. Hence, for each plasma-\nenhanced catalyst activation condition, an optimum time needs to be found for the plasma-\nassisted formation of nanoparticles to achieve high densities while avoiding undesired erosion of \nthe catalyst material. Note that achieving fast growth rates does not necessarily imply optimum \nconditions since it typically indicates lower density (under same growth conditions). When \nchanging the growth conditions while keeping the catalyst activation the same, the CNT density \nwas found the same while the growth rate was changing. Hence, the catalyst activation step \ndetermines the effective CNT density (and diameter) whereas the growth rate (for same density) \nis determined by the CNT growth conditions. \n \n \n   (a) \n \n XRR 0.43 g/cm\n \n 3\n \n ~10\n \n 12\n \n CNTs/cm\n \n 2\n \n 10 μm\n \n 36 μm\n \n 650C*\n \n   (b) \n \n 6.5\n \n 6.7nm\n \n 7.0\n \n HRTEM\n \n 6 walls\n \n  \n \n Figure 2. Cross-sectional SEM image of densely aligned CNT carpet (a) and high-resolution \nTEM image of single MW-CNT (b). CNT were grown from 0.5nm Fe catalyst deposited with \nion-beam sputtering on 5nm PVD Ti layer on SiO2/Si substrate: 5 minutes plasma-enhanced \ncatalyst activation at 650C in 1Torr H2 with 200W high-frequency plasma and 60 minutes \n \n growth at 650C in 1 Torr acetylene (C2H2). \n \n \n CNT growth on blanket substrates: effect of under layer \n \n \n  CNT growth with 0.5nm Fe catalyst was compared for Al, Ti, TiN and Ta/TaN layers on \nSiO2/Si wafers. The first two combinations are prone to oxidation and the metal surfaces will be \ncompletely transformed in Al2O3 and TiO2 surfaces, respectively (Al and Ti will also react with \nthe SiO2 underlayer at higher temperatures). The nitride compounds are more stable to oxidation \nand will be primarily metallic. In all cases straight aligned growth of multi-walled CNT was \nobtained, with higher tube density for the oxide surfaces (~1012 cm-2) compared to the metallic \nsurfaces (~1011 cm-2). The average diameter of the grown tubes was 6-9 nm on the oxide surfaces \ncompared to 8-12 nm on the metallic surfaces. Since surface diffusion is inhibited on oxide  \n  \n \n   \n surfaces, higher densities of smaller catalyst particles can be obtained during the plasma-\nenhanced thermal treatment during catalyst activation step. Interestingly, the CNT growth \nmechanism was found to be base growth (i.e. Fe remains on surfaces) for the Al2O3 and TiO2 \nsurfaces, while tip growth (i.e. Fe particles at the tip of the CNT) was observed for the Ta and \nTiN surfaces. Hence, the iron may also form compounds with the oxide thus being anchored on \nthe surface.  \n    \n \n CNT growth on blanket substrates: ECD versus PVD catalyst \n \n \n  Thus far we have shown that CNT density is largely affected by the conditions of catalyst \nactivation and by the underlaying substrate. Also the nature of the catalyst itself will determine \nthe density as well as growth kinetics. In general, for the same catalyst activation and growth \nconditions, the CNT growth was the fastest for Fe and the slowest for Ni, with Co in-between the \ntwo. The density (as well as growth rate) depended strongly on the amount of deposited catalyst, \nand typically less catalyst material was necessary for Fe and Co than for Ni to achieve similar \ndensities. Two methods for deposition of the catalyst have been evaluated: physical vapor \ndeposition (PVD) and electrochemical deposition (ECD). In the first case, (incomplete) thin \nfilms are deposited which are then transformed into particles by combination of thermal and \nplasma treatment. In the latter case, particles are immediately formed during the electrochemical \nnucleation and growth process: the particle density is determined by the applied potential and the \nparticle size is determined by the amount of deposited charge (corrected for the current \nefficiency) [16].   \n  \n \n   \n   \n Figure 3. Cross-sectional SEM images of CNT carpet layers deposited from Ni catalyst with \n5nm equivalent film thickness deposited with ECD ((a), (c) and (e)) and PVD ((b), (d) and (f)): \nplasma-enhanced catalyst activation in 1 Torr H2 at 200W high-frequency for 5 min + thermal \n \n growth in 1 Torr acetylene for 10 minutes at 650C ((a) and (b)), 550C ((c) and (d)) and 450C ((e) \nand (f)); the temperature for catalyst activation and growth were the same. \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  To evaluate both deposition methods CNT growth was compared for samples with same \namount of deposited catalyst material on TiN (70nm) and Ti(5nm)/TiN(70nm) substrates. Figure \n3 shows SEM images for PVD and ECD Ni catalyst samples for catalyst activation and growth at \ndifferent temperatures for the TiN substrates. In contrast to Fe catalyst, similar results were \nobtained for Ni on TiN and Ti/TiN substrates. At 650C, no significant difference between \ncatalyst deposition methods was seen: aligned growth of carpet layer of densely aligned CNT \nabout 13 to 14 um in length. At 550C, the CNT growth rate is lower resulting into 2-3 um long \nCNT carpets after 10 minutes. The ECD samples still produced aligned and dense CNT carpets. \nFor the PVD samples, the CNT density was somewhat lower, their morphology more bended \nand, moreover, large clusters were present on top of the CNT. At 450C, growth has not really \nstarted yet after 10min for the 5nm ECD sample; however a thin CNT layer was grown for 10nm \nECD Ni (not shown). For the PVD samples, a crusted layer is now clearly visible on top of the \nabout half a micron thick CNT carpet. Also for 0.8nm PVD Ni a thin crust is still distinguished \n \n ECD Ni on TiN\n \n 10μm 10μm\n \n 2.5μm\n5\n \n 5\n \n 0\n \n C\n \n PVD Ni on TiN\n \n 6\n \n 5\n \n 0\n \n C\n \n 2.5μm\n \n (a)\n \n (b)\n \n (c)\n \n (d)\n \n 0.5μm0.5μm\n4\n \n 5\n \n 0\n \n C\n \n (e)\n \n (f)\n \n ECD Ni on TiN\n \n 10μm 10μm\n \n 2.5μm\n5\n \n 5\n \n 0\n \n C\n \n PVD Ni on TiN\n \n 6\n \n 5\n \n 0\n \n C\n \n 2.5μm\n \n (a)\n \n (b)\n \n (c)\n \n (d)\n \n 0.5μm0.5μm\n4\n \n 5\n \n 0\n \n C\n \n (e)\n \n (f) \n  \n \n   \n and HRTEM revealed that in this case carbon nanofibers (CNF) were grown instead of tubes. \nThese results indicate that the PVD layer was not completely broken up into particles at \ntemperatures ≤ 550C. The agglomeration of PVD films is next to time, initial film thickness and \nambient pressure, strongly dependent on temperature [17]. SEM inspection of the samples with \nthe catalyst activation step only indeed showed clustered and connected Ni islands for the PVD \nfilms plasma treated at 550C, whereas the ECD Ni particles were similar to the as-deposited \nsamples (see also Figure 5). Since the BEOL temperature budget is limited, the room \ntemperature ECD technique has a significant industrial advantage. \n                \n \n CNT integration: selective catalyst placement and growth in via holes \n \n \n  The test structures used for integration experiments had large arrays of contact holes in \n330nm oxide dielectric landing on a 70nm TiN layer serving as a common electrode. Arrays with \nhole diameters ranging between 300nm and 150nm were available with relative pitch of 2, 3 and \n8. Figure 4 shows schematically the process flow followed for integration experiments.  \n \n \n                 \n \n Figure 4. Process flow for selective catalyst placement, CNT growth and top-contact formation \nfor test structures with via holes landing on a TiN layer which serves as common bottom \n \n electrode. For PVD deposition the catalyst particles are removed by CMP after a resist protection \nlayer is applied. For ECD the nanoparticles is deposited directly on the exposed bottom electrode \n \n without additional process steps needed. \n \n \n  Since the PVD catalyst film covers the whole wafer, the catalyst nanoparticles, formed by \ncombined thermal and plasma treatment are removed from the oxide field area by CMP. To \nprotect the catalyst nanoparticles inside the via during CMP, a protective resist layer is spin-\ncoated on top, which is removed again after the CMP step. After an additional cleaning step the \nnanoparticles are ready for CNT growth. Details of the process steps are given in [18]. Note that \nin this selective CMP approach, catalyst particles will be also present on the side walls of the via. \nThe CNT which will grow from the side-walls will not contribute the electrical conduction in \nthis case. Since ECD will only occur on the exposed TiN electrode, particles will be deposited on \n \n Catalyst \n \n deposition\n \n Annealing\n \n Particle \n \n protection\n \n Particle removal \n \n (CMP)\n \n Nanoparticles \n \n on the bottom\n \n CNT Growth\n \n Contact \n \n definition\n \n Non selective approach: Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) of catalyst\n \n Selective approach: \n \n Electrochemical deposition \n \n (ECD) of catalyst starts here\n \n Catalyst \n \n deposition\n \n Annealing\n \n Particle \n \n protection\n \n Particle removal \n \n (CMP)\n \n Nanoparticles \n \n on the bottom\n \n CNT Growth\n \n Contact \n \n definition\n \n Non selective approach: Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) of catalyst\n \n Selective approach: \n \n Electrochemical deposition \n \n (ECD) of catalyst starts here\n \n Catalyst \n \n deposition\n \n Annealing\n \n Particle \n \n protection\n \n Particle removal \n \n (CMP)\n \n Nanoparticles \n \n on the bottom\n \n CNT Growth\n \n Contact \n \n definition\n \n Non selective approach: Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) of catalyst\n \n Selective approach: \n \n Electrochemical deposition \n \n (ECD) of catalyst starts here\n \n Catalyst \n \n deposition\n \n Annealing\n \n Particle \n \n protection\n \n Particle removal \n \n (CMP)\n \n Nanoparticles \n \n on the bottom\n \n CNT Growth\n \n Contact \n \n definition\n \n Non selective approach: Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) of catalyst\n \n Selective approach: \n \n Electrochemical deposition \n \n (ECD) of catalyst starts here \n  \n \n   \n the bottom of the via only and one can proceed immediately to CNT growth. Note however that \nthe selective placement of the ECD catalyst is only valid in the proposed \"through-mask\" \napproach. In case of damascene liner coverage the particles will be also on the sidewalls and in \nthe field of the wafer. The advantage of ECD as low-temperature deposition technique remains \nhowever.  \n Figure 5 shows Ni nanoparticles as-deposited inside 150nm and 300nm vias with dense \nand isolated pitch. For comparison also Ni particles on blanket TiN are shown. Similar particle \ndensity and size were obtained independent of hole diameter and pitch and deposition conditions \nobtained for blanket substrates are directly transferable to patterned substrates. Due to the very \nshort deposition times (only nucleation), diffusion fields for Ni2+ ions are still small and not \naffected by its neighbors yet, which explains the absence of pattern density effects.   \n  \n \n            \n \n Figure 5.

The square pads were 50um or 100um in size and contacted \nseveral hundred vias in parallel. In all cases, Ohmic current-voltage characteristics were obtained \nfor the TiN/CNT/Ti contacts. For a quantitative measurement of the CNT via resistance, an \nelectrical test structure with Kelvin probe was used. 300nm vias in 650nm thick oxide were build \non top of M1 Cu level. Ta/TiN/Ni  was deposited with PVD and the top surface was removed by \nCMP using the selective protection procedure shown in Fig. 4 [18]. After CNT growth (thermal \ncatalyst activation + thermal growth) Ti pads were formed by PVD and lift-off for 4-point probe \nmeasurements. Contact with the bottom electrode (M1-Cu) was made through about 10,000 CNT \nvia landing on the contact pad. Two other Ti pads were connected to a Ti line crossing a single \nvia (Kelvin structure). The best measurement was obtained for 4nm Ni catalyst film with a via \nresistance of 0.1kΩ, which corresponds to about 1.2mΩ.cm when converted into an equivalent \nvia resisitivity. Y. Awano et al measured a resistance of 0.6Ω for a via with 2um in diameter and \n350nm high, which corresponds to an equivalent via resistivity of 0.6mΩ.cm [19, 20].   \n  \n \n CONCLUSIONS \n \n \n CNT interconnects at the via level could improve heat dissipation of the BEOL stack and \nas such reduce line resistance and electromigration issues, provided CNT-shell densities higher \nthan 5x1013 cm-2 can be achieved. Growth of densely aligned CNT carpets with tube density \n~1012cm-2 and shell density approaching ~1013cm-2 was demonstrated on Ti layers. Process steps \nfor selective growth of CNT into via holes with high yield and shell densities ~ 1012cm-2 were \ndeveloped. Electrical characteristics for TiN/CNT/Ti contacts were Ohmic and via resistivities \ndown to 1.2 mΩ cm were achieved. Additional work is needed to increase carbon shell density in \nvias and to implement the integration scheme to a (dual) damascene approach. Low resistance \nmetal contacts are needed to reduce contact resistance. \n \n 10 μm\n \n 1:2\n \n trench\n \n 1:3\n \n 300nm\n \n (a) (b)\n \n 10 μm\n \n 1:2\n \n trench\n \n 1:3\n \n 300nm300nm\n \n (a) (b) \n  \n \n   \n   \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n \n This work was partly supported by the EU projects CARBonCHIP (NMP4-CT-2006-\n016475) and SEA-NET Pro-Nano (IST-027982) and by METACEL project (IWT-SBO project \n060031) funded by IWT-Vlaanderen.

    {"values":"The microwave tunable capability and its related material optimization of (Ba,Sr)TiO3 thin films in the parallel-plate capacitor form is discussed in terms of the dependence of barium concentration, acceptor doping, and in-plane film stress, based on the present broadband microwave characterization technique under various bias fields. The barium-content dependence indicates the tradeoff between tunability and dielectric loss, and the notable field-induced loss in SrTiO3 is confirmed as an intrinsic quasi-Debye contribution. The Mg dopant incorporated into a perovskite lattice shows almost no effectiveness on tunable device performance, except for enhanced insulation as an electron acceptor, while the low bias-field dependence of the dielectric loss suggests the possibility of the partial occupation of the alkaline-earth-ion site by Mg. The reduction of in-plane thermal stress controlled by the pressure during sputtering deposition leads to higher permittivity and tunability while degrading the film crystallinity by ion bombardment. The low-frequency loss tends to increase with crystal damage; however, the microwave loss remains unchanged, revealing the applicability of sputtering stress control to real microwave devices. In addition, we demonstrate the operation of an analog phase shifter using parallel-plate ferroelectric tunable capacitors and its application to a phased array antenna monolithically integrated on a silicon substrate."    },

The barium-content dependence indicates the tradeoff between tunability and dielectric loss, and the notable field-induced loss in SrTiO3 is confirmed as an intrinsic quasi-Debye contribution. The Mg dopant incorporated into a perovskite lattice shows almost no effectiveness on tunable device performance, except for enhanced insulation as an electron acceptor, while the low bias-field dependence of the dielectric loss suggests the possibility of the partial occupation of the alkaline-earth-ion site by Mg. The reduction of in-plane thermal stress controlled by the pressure during sputtering deposition leads to higher permittivity and tunability while degrading the film crystallinity by ion bombardment. The low-frequency loss tends to increase with crystal damage; however, the microwave loss remains unchanged, revealing the applicability of sputtering stress control to real microwave devices. In addition, we demonstrate the operation of an analog phase shifter using parallel-plate ferroelectric tunable capacitors and its application to a phased array antenna monolithically integrated on a silicon substrate. \n (Received June 17 2008) \n (Accepted July 10 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t ferroelectric;  \n\t thin film;  \n\t electrical properties \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t \t  How to Cite This

,"description":"The microwave tunable capability and its related material optimization of (Ba,Sr)TiO3 thin films in the parallel-plate capacitor form is discussed in terms of the dependence of barium concentration, acceptor doping, and in-plane film stress, based on the present broadband microwave characterization technique under various bias fields. The barium-content dependence indicates the tradeoff between tunability and dielectric loss, and the notable field-induced loss in SrTiO3 is confirmed as an intrinsic quasi-Debye contribution. The Mg dopant incorporated into a perovskite lattice shows almost no effectiveness on tunable device performance, except for enhanced insulation as an electron acceptor, while the low bias-field dependence of the dielectric loss suggests the possibility of the partial occupation of the alkaline-earth-ion site by Mg. The reduction of in-plane thermal stress controlled by the pressure during sputtering deposition leads to higher permittivity and tunability while degrading the film crystallinity by ion bombardment. The low-frequency loss tends to increase with crystal damage; however, the microwave loss remains unchanged, revealing the applicability of sputtering stress control to real microwave devices. In addition, we demonstrate the operation of an analog phase shifter using parallel-plate ferroelectric tunable capacitors and its application to a phased array antenna monolithically integrated on a silicon substrate.","coins":   [

    {"values":"Self-forming barrier process was carried out on a porous low-k material with the Cu-Mn alloys. The effects of various surface treatments were investigated in the sample having a pore size of 0.9 nm and a porosity of 25%. Before and after annealing, samples were analyzed in cross section with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Concentration profile was also analyzed with time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS). The results indicated the penetration of Cu into the low-k interior during deposition, followed by the segregation of Cu at the low-k/Si interface during subsequent annealing. Although a diffusion barrier layer was formed and no further Cu penetration was not observed during annealing, initial Cu penetration in the deposition process was detrimental and should be prevented by restoring the plasma damage on the low-k surface."    },

The effects of various surface treatments were investigated in the sample having a pore size of 0.9 nm and a porosity of 25%. Before and after annealing, samples were analyzed in cross section with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Concentration profile was also analyzed with time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS). The results indicated the penetration of Cu into the low-k interior during deposition, followed by the segregation of Cu at the low-k/Si interface during subsequent annealing. Although a diffusion barrier layer was formed and no further Cu penetration was not observed during annealing, initial Cu penetration in the deposition process was detrimental and should be prevented by restoring the plasma damage on the low-k surface. \n (Received May 01 2008) \n (Accepted May 01 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t barrier layer;  \n\t dielectric properties;  \n\t diffusion \n

,"description":"Self-forming barrier process was carried out on a porous low-k material with the Cu-Mn alloys. The effects of various surface treatments were investigated in the sample having a pore size of 0.9 nm and a porosity of 25%. Before and after annealing, samples were analyzed in cross section with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Concentration profile was also analyzed with time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS). The results indicated the penetration of Cu into the low-k interior during deposition, followed by the segregation of Cu at the low-k/Si interface during subsequent annealing. Although a diffusion barrier layer was formed and no further Cu penetration was not observed during annealing, initial Cu penetration in the deposition process was detrimental and should be prevented by restoring the plasma damage on the low-k surface.","coins":   [

    {"values":"To better understand the factors governing the reliability of lead free solders during severe excursions in temperature, the hardness and elastic modulus of the micro-phases formed in a Sn-Ag-Cu/Cu solder joint were characterized using nanoindentation at temperatures from 25 to 175°C. The creep behaviour of the different micro-phases was also studied as function of temperature. The hardness and elastic modulus of Cu6Sn5, Cu3Sn had a weak dependence on temperature, while primary Sn, eutectic regions and electroplated Cu hardness and modulus were sensitive to temperature. Creep studies indicated that intermetallic were more creep resistant than softer phases that readily underwent creep, the type and rate of which was shown to be strongly temperature dependent."    },

The creep behaviour of the different micro-phases was also studied as function of temperature. The hardness and elastic modulus of Cu6Sn5, Cu3Sn had a weak dependence on temperature, while primary Sn, eutectic regions and electroplated Cu hardness and modulus were sensitive to temperature. Creep studies indicated that intermetallic were more creep resistant than softer phases that readily underwent creep, the type and rate of which was shown to be strongly temperature dependent. \n

,"description":"To better understand the factors governing the reliability of lead free solders during severe excursions in temperature, the hardness and elastic modulus of the micro-phases formed in a Sn-Ag-Cu/Cu solder joint were characterized using nanoindentation at temperatures from 25 to 175°C. The creep behaviour of the different micro-phases was also studied as function of temperature. The hardness and elastic modulus of Cu6Sn5, Cu3Sn had a weak dependence on temperature, while primary Sn, eutectic regions and electroplated Cu hardness and modulus were sensitive to temperature. Creep studies indicated that intermetallic were more creep resistant than softer phases that readily underwent creep, the type and rate of which was shown to be strongly temperature dependent.","coins":   [

By plasma-polymerization (PP) \nprocess using ring-type siloxane precursor, a new self-organized porous SiOCH film is \ndeveloped with preserving the original hexagonal silica-backbone, so called as a molecular-pore-\nstack (MPS) SiOCH film.  The hydrocarbon-rich MPS film has high endurance to the process \ndamages.  A density-modulated MPS film with low-k cap is obtained with reinforced interfaces \nby plasma co-polymerization (PcP) process in the one-step deposition scheme using the ring-type \nand a linear-type siloxane, applicable for 32nm-nodes and beyond at a low manufacturing cost. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n \n To reduce the parasitic capacitance in scaled-down ULSI interconnects [1], a low-k \ndielectric film of SiOCH with k~3 had been introduced in 90nm-nodes.  For further scaling, \nporous low-k films have been implemented into 65nm-nodes ULSIs [9, 10] as shown in Fig. 1. \nThe porous low-k films contain tiny pores with k~1 in the SiOCH matrix, reducing the effective \nfilm density or eventually the dielectric constant (k).  But, the pores have potential issues to \ndegrade the film stability [2] and the dielectric reliability, if we don\u0092t care the pore structure as \nillustrated in Fig. 2.  Namely, the porous low-k film is easy to adsorb moisture (H2O) of k~80.  \nEspecially, in case of the pores clustered to the film surface just like tiny channels, moisture is \nimmersed easily into the film.  The moisture uptake is a serious problem to increase the effective \nk-value [3].  Secondary, the porous low-k film is very sensitive to chemical/physical attacks to \nrelease the hydrocarbon (-CHx) from the low-k matrix, increasing the k-value.  To overcome \nthese issues, physical and chemical structure of the porous films should be controlled precisely. \n \n \n Fig. 1   Structure evolution of LSI interconnects \nfrom 500nm to 65nm-nodes during 16 years. \n \n Fig. 2   Issues on the pours film integration and an ideal \nstructure desired. \n \n Porous \nLow-k\n \n High-k \nBarrier \n(SiCN)\n \n <Damages>\n・Metal PVD\n・Etching\n・O2-Ashing\n \n <Moisture\nuptake>\n \n Leakage, TDDB\n \n CuCuCu ×××\n \n Defects Ideal  Structure\n \n CuCuCu\n \n An Ideal structure;\n�No moisture uptake.\n�No process damage without any recover  processes.\n�No high-k barrie dielectrics (SiCN). \n�Simple one-step deposition without post-cure.\n⇒ Plasma polymerization and Plasma copolymerization.\n \n S\nin\n \n gl\ne \n \n st\nep\n \n Low-k \nBarrier\n \n Stable \nporous film\n \n Porous \nLow-k\n \n High-k \nBarrier \n(SiCN)\n \n <Damages>\n・Metal PVD\n・Etching\n・O2-Ashing\n \n <Moisture\nuptake>\n \n Leakage, TDDB\n \n CuCuCuCu ×××\n \n Defects Ideal  Structure\n \n CuCuCuCu\n \n An Ideal structure;\n�No moisture uptake.\n�No process damage without any recover  processes.\n�No high-k barrie dielectrics (SiCN). \n�Simple one-step deposition without post-cure.\n⇒ Plasma polymerization and Plasma copolymerization.\n \n S\nin\n \n gl\ne \n \n st\nep\n \n Low-k \nBarrier\n \n Stable \nporous film\n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1079 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1079-N01-01 \n  \n \n   \n Most of the dielectric films have been deposited by plasma-CVD process, so it is better to \ncontrol the porous structure by the plasma-CVD or the modified ones.  Meanwhile, we \ndeveloped a modified plasma-CVD process, so called as \u0093plasma polymerization (PP) process\u0094 \nat 1999 as shown in Fig. 3.  The idea is quite simple that siloxane monomers with side-chains of \nunsaturated hydrocarbon (USHC) are vaporized, and introduced into He plasma to deposit a \nsiloxane film through the USHC polymerization. This idea was confirmed firstly by using \ndivinyl siloxane benzocyclobuten (DVS-BCB) to deposit the PP BCB film [4-6]. Next, we \nexpected that the PP process could be possible for deposition of a self-organized porous film \nwhen ring-type siloxane molecules with USHC side-chains was used as a precursor [7]. We also \nconsidered that the PP process could extend to a plasma copolymerization (PcP) process by \nintroducing two types of monomers with USHC to reinforce the film properties [8, 9]. \n \n In this paper, first a PP process is explained to deposit a self-organized porous SiOCH \nfilm, so-called as a \u0093Molecular Pore Stack\u0094(MPS) SiOCH film. Then, a newly-developed \nmodulated PcP process is elucidated for the density-modulation in the MPS film.  Finally, based \non the modulated PcP process with sophisticated molecular structure design [10-15], cost-\neffective full low-k Cu interconnects is described. \n \n  \nFig. 3  Physical and chemical structural control of low-k SiOCH films by \nplasma polymerization (PP) and plasma copolymerization (PcP) processes. \n \n  \n \n  \n \n EXPERIMENTAL \nSeveral types of ring-type siloxane monomers were prepared as shown in Table I [17]. \n \n The siloxane was vaporized with He carrier gas, and was introduced into RF plasma chamber \nvacuumed down to 0.1~0.5 torr as shown in Fig. 4.  The film was deposited on a silicon wafer \nheated at 350oC by 100W~400W.  For the PcP or the modulated PcP, a ring-type and a liner-type \nsiloxanes were introduced at the same time with the mixing ratio fixed or modulated, \nrespectively.  The chemical structure and the composition film was analyzed by FTIR, Raman \nspectroscopy, and RBS.  The pore size and silica-backbone-structure were examined by small-\nangle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and solid-state NMR (Si29).  \n  \n \n   \n Table I   Ring-type siloxane monomers used in this \nexperiment [17]. \n \n Si\n \n O\nSi\n \n O\n \n Si\nO\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3 CH3\n \n CH3\n \n RL\n \n RL\n \n RL\n \n H3C\n \n CH3\n \n H3C\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH2 Si\n \n O\nSi\n \n O\n \n Si\nO\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3 CH3\n \n CH3\n \n RL\n \n RL\n \n RL\n \n H3C\n \n CH3\n \n H3C\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH2Si\n \n O\nSi\n \n O\n \n Si\nO\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3 CH3\n \n CH3\n \n RL\n \n RL\n \n RLSi\nO\n \n Si\nO\n \n Si\nO\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3 CH3\n \n CH3\n \n RL\n \n RL\n \n RL\n \n RL\n \n RL\n \n RLSi\nO\n \n Si\nO\n \n Si\nO\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3 CH3\n \n CH3\n \n RS\n \n RS\n \n RSSi\nO\n \n Si\nO\n \n Si\nO\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH2\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3\n \n CH3 CH3\n \n CH3\n \n RS\n \n RS\n \n RS\n \n SHC\nAlkyl (RL)\n \n SHC\n(Ethyl)\n \n 6\n \n 3E3RL\n \n Ring\n \n SHC\nAlkyl (RS)：\n \n -CH3\n \n USHC\n(Vinyl)\n \n 8\n \n 4V4Rs\n \n Ring RingRingType\n \n SHC\nAlkyl (RL)\n \n SHC\nAlkyl (RS)：\n \n -CH3\n \n Side-chain \n2 (R2)\n \n 66\nMember \n \n of SiO ring\n \n USHC\n(Viny)l\n \n USHC\n(Vinyl)\n \n Side-chain \n1 (R1)\n \n Monomer\nstructure\n \n 3V3RL3V3RSSymbol\n \n SHC\nAlkyl (RL)\n \n SHC\n(Ethyl)\n \n 6\n \n 3E3RL\n \n Ring\n \n SHC\nAlkyl (RS)：\n \n -CH3\n \n USHC\n(Vinyl)\n \n 8\n \n 4V4Rs\n \n Ring RingRingType\n \n SHC\nAlkyl (RL)\n \n SHC\nAlkyl (RS)：\n \n -CH3\n \n Side-chain \n2 (R2)\n \n 66\nMember \n \n of SiO ring\n \n USHC\n(Viny)l\n \n USHC\n(Vinyl)\n \n Side-chain \n1 (R1)\n \n Monomer\nstructure\n \n 3V3RL3V3RSSymbol\n \n Molecular weight : RL>RS\n \n Si\nSi\n \n O\nO\n \n Si O\nSiO\n \n Rs\n \n Rs\n \n Rs\n \n Rs\n \n Si\nSi\n \n O\nO\n \n Si O\nSiO\n \n Si\nSi\n \n O\nO\n \n Si O\nSiO\n \n Rs\n \n Rs\n \n Rs\n \n Rs\n \n Si\nSi\n \n O\nO\n \n Si O\nSiO\n \n  \n \n  \nFig. 4  Low-k deposition system for the PP and \nthe PcP processes, which is based on a \nconventional plasma-CVD system.  \n \n  \n \nRESULTS and DISCUSSION \nMPS SiOCH film by plasma-polymerization (PP) process \n \n \n Chemical and physical structure of SiOCH films depends on molecular structure of the \nprecursor monomers [7]. Namely, in case of the siloxane monomers without USHC side-chains, \nthe precursor monomers were decomposed in He plasma before the film deposition, whose \ncomposition was much different from that of the precursor.  No porous SiOCH film was obtained \nfrom linear-type siloxane monomers.  On contrast, when ring-type siloxane monomer with \nUSHC was used, porous SiOCH film was deposited.  Important finding is that the porous \nstructure was reflected to the original ring structure.  Fig. 5 shows the pore diameter distribution \nand the Raman spectroscopy of the SiOCH films from the precursors of 6-member or 8-member \nrings such as 3V3RL and 4V4Rs, which have the silica rings of 0.36nm and 0.45nm diameters, \nrespectively.  The pore diameter distribution of the SiOCH film from the 6-member ring \n(3V3RL) was smaller than that form the 8-member ring (4V4Rs).  By Raman spectroscopy, it is \nalso found that the SiOCH film from 3V3RL had hexagonal silica network while the SiOCH film \nfrom 4V4Rs composed of poly- or octahedral siloxane network.  Solid-state NMR spectroscopy \nof Si29 indicates that the SiOCH film from 3V3RL consisted of cyclic siloxane networks more \nthan a conventional plasma-CVD SiOCH film.  These experimental results indicate that the ring-\ntype siloxane molecules with USHC side-chains are polymerized in He plasma chamber to \ndeposit a self-organized porous SiOCH films on the Si-wafer.  \n \n The ring-type siloxane molecules have side-chains of saturated hydrocarbon (SHC) as well \nas USHC.  Both of the side-chains are very important for control the plasma reaction or \neventually the deposition rate and/or the chemical composition [17].  Fig. 6 shows the deposition \ncharacteristics of the SiOCH films from the 6-member hexagonal ring-type siloxanes as listed in \nTable I.  From comparison of 3V3Rs with 3E3Rs, the USHC side-chain is confirmed again to \nenhance the deposition rate keeping the k-value low in He plasma.  Comparing 3V3RL with \n3V3Rs, the larger SHC improves the deposition rate and enriches the carbon-comment in the \nfilm. By PALS analysis [16], the SiOCH film from 3V3RL had closed pores in Fig. 7. \n \n Namely, by PP process using the ring-type siloxane with USHC side-chains, self-organized \nporous SiOCH film is obtained without post-cure process such as UV or EB radiation [18].  \n  \n \n   \n Hereafter, the porous SiOCH film from 3V3RL is called as MPS SiOCH film. The MPS-SiOCH \nfilm of k~2.5 is featured as a hydrocarbon-rich SiOCH film with 0.36nm-diameter pores, while \nthe conventional PECVD SiOCH films are oxygen-rich or carbon-poor as shown in Table II. \n \n  \n \n Fig. 5  Characteristics of the SiOCH films by the PP process using 6-member (3V3RL) or 8-\nmenber (4V4Rs) ring-type siloxanes; (a) schematic illustration of the plasma reaction process, (b) \npore-diameter distribution by SAXS, (c) Raman and (d) Solid-state NMR (Si29) spectroscopes. \n \n Fig. 6  Characteristics of the SiOCH films by the PP process using 6-member ring-type siloxanes \nhaving different side-chain chemicals; (a) the deposition rate and (b) the k-vales as a function of \nthe deposition pressure, and (c) the chemical composition in the films (RBS) [17]. \n \n \n  \nTable II   Properties of SiOCH films. \n \n Fig. 7  PALS of bare and capped films of porgen-type \nand non-porogen-type porous SiOCH films. The MPS \nfilm had no difference between the bare and the capped \nfilms, indicative of closed pores in the film [16].  \n  \n \n   \n Stability of MPS SiOCH film \n  \n \n The MPS SiOCH film, which has carbon-rich hexagonal silica backbone with sub-nanometer \npores, is superior stability against moisture uptake and plasma-induced damages.  Fig. 8 shows \nthe k-value increment of the SiOCH films as a function of the pore diameter after water dipping \nand PCT test (125oC, 100%-humidity).  In case of the dipping in water, no k-value increment \nwas observed, indicative of no water immersion into the pores within 1nm-dieameters.  After \nsever PCT test, the k-value increased due to the moisture uptake into the pores over 0.6nm-\ndiameters.  No k-value increment was observed for the MPS film even though the PCT test.   \n \n Fig. 9 shows the k-value increment after PVD Ta barrier metal deposition as a function of the \nDC bias to the Ta target [19].  Note that, in this RF PVD system, lower DC bias to the target \ndecrease the substrate bias.  In case of the conventional carbon-poor SiOCH films in Table II, the \nk-values increased over -40V biases, while k-value of the MPS film was unchanged even at 0V \nbias or the maximum substrate bias.  By FTIR analysis, the conventional carbon-poor SiOCH \nfilms lost a lot of hydrocarbons by the Ta ion bombardment, resulting in alternation of Si-CH3 \nbonds to Si-H bond.  In case of the MPS film with large hydrocarbon side-chains, the \nhydrocarbon content decreased by the Ta bombardment, but the Si-CH3 bonds did not decrease \ndue to protection of the silica backbone by the long hydrocarbon chains from the direct \nbombardment of Ta ions.  Fig. 10 shows XSEM of the Cu damascene interconnects as a function \nof O2 plasma ashing time duration.  Here, the damage layer of hydrocarbon depletion was \ndetected by dipping in diluted HF solution [20]. It is found that the hydrocarbon-rich MPS film \nhad the strongest endurance to the O2 plasma. \n \n The MPS SiOCH film of k~2.5 has been implemented as inter-metal dielectric (IMD) film \nfor 45nm-node ULSI with the 140nm-pitched lines [12] as shown in Fig. 11.  The effective k-\nvalue of the interconnect module (keff) including high-k SiCN cap was 2.95, decreasing the \nsignal delay of a interconnect-loaded ring-oscillator by 15% to a 65nm-node structure with \nkeff=3.4.  The stable MPS SiOCH film is a strong candidate for 45nm-node and beyond. \n \n \n Fig. 8   Effect of the pore size on the k-value \nincrement of SiOCH films after water-dipping, \npressure-cooker test of 125oC under 100% humidity. \nNo increment of the k-value was observed in the \nMPS film even after PCT. \n \n Fig. 9   Damages on the SiOCH films by Ta barrier \nPVD as a function of target DC bias.  The 0V of \ntarget bias derives the hardest ion bombardment to \nthe SiOCH films [19].  The MPS had the strongest \nendurance to the Ta ion bombardment by PVD.  \n  \n \n   \n   \n Fig. 10  Damaged thickness of the SiOCH films by \nextended O2 plasma exposure after the SiOCH etching.  \nThe damaged thickness was determined as the etched \nthickness by dipping diluted HF solution [20] \n \n Fig. 11  XTEM images of Cu dual damascene \ninterconnect in the MPS-SiOCH for 45nm-node \nULSIs.  The line pitch and the via-diameter are \n140nm and 70nm, respectively [12]. \n \n  \n \n Density-modulated MPS SiOCH film for 32nm-nodes ULSIs \n \n \n Toward 32/22nm-nodes, the interconnect pitch is scaled down while the power supply \nvoltage is kept a constant due to the lower limitation of Vth for the scaled-down MOSFETs, thus \nincreasing the electric field between the interconnects.  Under the high electric field, interface \namong the interconnect modules should be reinforced without any introduction of defects as \nshown in Fig. 12.  We have innovated a modulated plasma-copolymerization (PcP) process to \nreinforce the interface. \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n Fig. 12  Scaling issue toward \n32nm/22nm-node integration such \nas the electrical field strengthen \nbetween the narrow-pitched lines \nunder non-scaled power supply \nvoltage. \n \n Fig. 13   A modulated PcP process for a density-modulated MPS \nSiOCH film using a mixed gas of the ring-type (3V3RL) and a linear-\ntype siloxane with side-chains of USHC and SHC; (a) the PcP reaction \nscheme, (b) Raman spectroscopy of a silica-amorphous-carbon \ncomposite (SACC) film from 100% injection of the linear-type \nsiloxane as well as a conventional SiOCH film, and (c) the film \nproperties by PcP process, and.

The ring-type and the linear-type siloxanes are \ncopolymerized through the USHC side-chains in He plasma.  In case of the 100% injection of the \nlinear-type siloxane, a silica-amorphous carbon composite (SACC) film was deposited with \nk=3.1, detected by Raman spectroscopy in Fig. 13(b). The SACC film had extremely high \nmodulus of 26 GPa.  By mixing the monomer gas of the linear-type to the ring-type, the k-value \nand the modulus of the MPS film increased as shown in Fig. 13(c).  Conversely, this fact \nindicates us that the MPS film properties could be controlled by changing the mixing ratio such \nas 20% ⇒ 100% ⇒ 0% (100% of linear-type) of the ring-type in the one deposition scheme.  By \nthe modulated PcP process, a Cu dual damascene (DD) module with 100nm-pitched lines was \nfabricated with a density-modulated MPS film [14], in which the MPS IMD film was \nsandwiched between the copolymerized MPS via-ILD and the SACC of surface protection hard-\nmask (HM) as shown in Fig. 14.  In other words, the upper and bottom interfaces of the MPS \nfilm were reinforced by the SACC and the copolymerized MPS with SACC.  The interconnect \nmodule had keff=2.95 including high-k SiCN capping layer on the Cu lines.   \n \n Fig. 15 shows Pool-Frenkel (PF) plots of the leakage currents between the 50nm-spced \nlines in the moderated MPS film as well as the MPS films with the SiO2-HM or the SiOCH-HM \n[14]. These HM layers were deposited by multi-step process with air break.  The modulated MPS \nstructure reduced the leakage current very much. The active energies were similar between the \nthree structures, but the pre-exponential factor, which was related to the defect density, was \n1/2000 smaller than the multi-step MPS films.  The high endurance of the modulated MPS film \nmight be related to suppression of the defects at the interface by the modulated PcP process. \n \n Namely, it is confirmed that the modulated MSP structure is desirable for the scaled-\ndown interconnects to keep dielectric endurance by the modulated PcP process using ring-type \nand linear-type siloxane monomers. \n \n \n  \n \n Fig. 14  A 100nm-pitched Cu DD interconnects in the density-modified MPS SiOCH films by modified PcP \nprocess.  Here, the gas mixing ratio of the ring and linear types is changed during the deposition such as 20%, \n100% and 0% of the ring-type. As the result, the MPS IMD film is sandwiched between the copolymerized \nMPS via-ILD and the thin SACC of surface protection hard-mask (HM) layer. By RBS analysis, the \ncompositional profile of the modulated MPS film in the film thickness direction is modulated by \ncorresponding to the mixing ratio modulation [14]. \n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n RRR\n \n Cu-\nalloy\n \n Elastic modulus\n(GPa)\n \n 24.8\n \n k=2.5\n \n k=3.1\n \n k=2.8\n \n 3.0\n \n 12.6\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n RRR\n \n +\n \n 100nm-pitch\n \n SiCN\n \n Si\n \n O\nC\n \n IMD\n \n Via-ILD\n \n Composition \nprofiles\n \n H\nM\n \n SiCN-cap\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n RRRRRRR\n \n Cu-\nalloy\n \n Elastic modulus\n(GPa)\n \n 24.8\n \n k=2.5\n \n k=3.1\n \n k=2.8\n \n 3.0\n \n 12.6\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n R\n \n R\nR\n \n RRRRRRR\n \n +\n \n 100nm-pitch\n \n SiCN\n \n Si\n \n O\nC\n \n IMD\n \n Via-ILD\n \n Composition \nprofiles\n \n H\nM\n \n SiCN\n \n Si\n \n O\nC\n \n IMD\n \n Via-ILD\n \n Composition \nprofiles\n \n H\nM\n \n SiCN-cap \n  \n \n   \n  \nFig. 16   Pool-Frenkel plots of the 50nm-spaced Cu lines in the modulated MPS \nfilms by the modulated PcP process as well as the multi-stepped MPS films with \nSiO2-HM and SiOCH-HM [14] \n \n  \n \n  \nUltimate Full Low-k Interconnect toward 22nm-node and beyond \n  \n We found that the SACC had excellent barrier property against the Cu diffusion even \nthough the k-value was 3.1, which could be utilized as a low-k capping layer, instead of high-k \nSiCN layer, on Cu lines [15] as shown in Fig. 17.  So, we incorporated the SACC-cap in the \nmodulated MSP deposition scheme, in which the gas mixing ration was changed as 100% ⇒ \n80%  ⇒ 0%  ⇒ 100% injection of the linear-type siloxane to the ring-type one for the capping \nlayer, the via-ILD, the IMD and the surface protection HM layer, respectively.  Fig. 18 shows \nXTEM micrograph and RBS compositional profiles of the Cu interconnects in the modulated \nMPS film with the SACC capping layer seamlessly.  Here, before the SACC deposition, the Cu \nline  surface was treated by anti-oxidation coating in the same reaction chamber. The effective k-\nvalue of the interconnect module was reduced from 2.95 with the SiCN-cap to 2.75 with the \nSACC-cap.  No degradation was observed in the dielectric endurance between the lines.  \nMoreover, the EM reliability was improved due to simplicity in the deposition process. \n  Fig. 18 summarizes the structural evaluation of the Cu interconnect modules from the \nMPS-SiOCH film to the intimate full low-k MPS SiOCH films.  All of these MPS-based SiOCH \nfilms are based on the PP or the modulated PcP processes using the hexagonal ring-type and the \nlinear-type siloxanes.  The in-situ density-modulation in the MPS SiOCH film accomplishes \nrobust low-k module to reinforce the interfaces without defect introduction under simple and \ncost-effective process. \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \n \n By the modulated PcP process, physical and chemical structures in porous SiOCH films is \nmanipulated by molecular level. The self-organized pore structure was obtained by the PP \nprocess using the hexagonal ring-type siloxane with USHC side-chains.  The MPS film with  \n  \n \n   \n hydro carbon-rich hexagonal silica matrix has high endurance to the process damage.  By in-situ \nmodulated PcP process using the ring-type and the linear-type siloxanes, a full low-k module of \nkeff=2.75 with low-k SACC cap was realized with good mechanical strength, adhesion and \nreliability, at a low manufacturing cost.  The modulated PcP process is a key technology for \nscaled-down ULSI fabrication toward 32/22nm-nodes integrations. \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n \n This research has been done in LSI Fundamental Research Laboratory, NEC ELECTRONICS \nand NEC.

Tamura1, and K. N. Tu2 \n1Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 1 Cyclotron Road, Berkeley, \nCA, 94720 \n2Department of Materials Science and Engineering, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, 90095 \n \nABSTRACT   \n \n Electromigration is a phenomenon that has attracted much attention in the semiconductor \nindustry because of its deleterious effects on electronic devices (such as interconnects) as they \nbecome smaller and current density passing through them increases.  However, the effect of the \nelectric current on the microstructure of interconnect lines during the very early stage of \nelectromigration is not well documented.  In the present report, we used synchrotron radiation \nbased polychromatic X-ray microdiffraction for the in-situ study of the electromigration induced \nplasticity effects on individual grains of an Al (Cu) interconnect test structure.  Dislocation slips \nwhich are activated by the electric current stressing are analyzed by the shape change of the \ndiffraction peaks.  The study shows polygonization of the grains due to the rearrangement of \ngeometrically necessary dislocations (GND) in the direction of the current.  Consequences of \nthese findings are discussed. \n \n INTRODUCTION   \n \n Electromigration (EM) refers to the mass transport phenomenon of materials due to \nelectric current when the current density reaches high values.  This phenomenon can have \ndeleterious effects on microelectronic devices such as integrated circuits (ICs) [1].  In very-large-\nscale integration (VLSI) of circuits on a Si device, Al or Cu thin-film line can experience current \ndensity as high as 106 A/cm2, which is enough to cause the atomic motion from the cathode end \nto the anode end at the device working temperature.  Thus voids may form at the cathode end \nand extrusion may be squeezed out at the anode end, respectively [2].  Although a lot of models \nhave been proposed to understand the mechanism of EM [3-6] , the effect of the atomic transport \non the dislocation movement and local material microstructure, especially in the early stage of \nEM is still unclear.   \n \n High brilliance X-ray beam with submicron to micron beam size can be produced by \nfocusing optics such as Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) mirrors at synchrotron facilities [7, 8].  X-ray \nmicrodiffraction has been developed for the crystal microstructure study.  In this technique, since \nthe crystal grains are larger than the X-ray beam size, a single crystal Laue diffraction pattern is \nobtained when polychromatic (white beam) X-ray impinges on the sample.  By analyzing the \nLaue diffraction pattern, the orientation and strain information of the material irradiated can be \nobtained, and the spatial resolution is only limited by the size of the focused X-ray beam.   \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1079 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1079-N05-02 \n  \n \n   \n Previous works have shown the potential of Laue X-ray microdiffraction for EM study on \ninterconnect lines [9-15].  In the present report, we report a more in-depth microstructure study \nin an Al (0.5 wt % Cu) interconnect during the early stage of electromigration.  \n \n EXPERIMENTAL   \n \n  The EM test sample is a sputtered 30 μm long, 4.1 μm wide and 0.75 μm thick Al (0.5 wt \n% Cu) two-level structure.  A 450 Å thick Ti layer at the bottom of the Al line, as well as another \nlayer with 100 Å thick on the top, is used as shunt.  The Al line is constrained by a 0.7 μm \nthickness SiO2 passivation layer.  Several W vias are used for electrical connection between this \nAl line and unpassivated Al (Cu) pads at each end.  The sample is annealed at 390 oC in a rough \nvacuum for 30 min to stabilize the crystal structure before EM test.   \n The in-situ X-ray microdiffraction experiment was conducted on beamline 7.3.3 at the \nAdvanced Light Source synchrotron in Berkeley, CA [16].  The X-ray beam size is 0.7 x 0.7 \nμm2.  The wired-bonded sample and an X-ray CCD detector are mounted at 45o and 90o with \nrespect to the beam, respectively.  The CCD detector is fixed at 5 cm above the sample when \nwhite beam Laue diffractions are recorded.  \n \n The EM test is conducted at a 224 oC (heater temperature) and the current density is \nramped up to 0.98×106 A/cm2 (I=30 mA) and maintained constant for 45 hours.  Before and \nduring the EM test, Laue diffraction patterns are recorded by scanning the sample repeatedly by \nthe submicron-sized white beam.  The scanning step size is 0.5 μm, so 15 steps across the width \nof the line, 65 steps along the length, and a total of 975 CCD frames are needed to cover the \nwhole surface of the sample for each scan.  The exposure time is set as 5 seconds so that the \nintensity of the diffraction peaks is strong but not saturated.  The electronic readout time for each \nframe is about 10 seconds.  As a result, for each scan, it takes about 4 to 5 hours.  The Laue \ndiffraction data are analyzed using the custom written XMAS software [11, 17].  \n \n RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS \n \n Dislocation active slip systems   \n \n Large grains in the Al interconnect line, especially those that span across the width of the \nline (\u201cbamboo\u201d type), are subject to opposite stress moments on opposite sides across the width.  \nWhen a certain yield stress was reached, these grains would bend and ultimately polygonize [10].  \n \n This aspect of plastic deformation results in broadening of the Laue spots along certain \ndirections compatible with the bending direction due to the arrangement of excess geometrically \nnecessary dislocations (GNDs).  Different dislocation slips can result in different shapes of the \nLaue peaks.  As a result, analysis of the Laue spot broadening patterns allows for the \nidentification of the active dislocation glide system that produced the bending.   \n \n First the orientation of a given grain is known by indexing the Laue pattern.  Secondly, \nall the possible streaking directions of the Laue peaks are simulated, each of which corresponds \nto a certain dislocation slip system.  Since Al has FCC crystal structure, for each grain, there are \n12 possible slip types, all of which are {111}/<110> oriented, which means 12 possibilities for  \n  \n \n   \n both edge dislocations and screw dislocations.  Then all of these 24 simulated diffraction patterns \nare compared with the experimental result, and the best fitting will tell the real dislocation slip \ntype.  In figure 1(a), the white streaking peaks are from one of the typical Laue patterns of a \ndeformed grain after 12 hours EM test, and the yellow patterns are the best matched simulation \n \n result.  In this example, the slip plane is (111) ; the Burger\u2019s vector is along the [101] direction; \nand the dislocations are edge typed, so the dislocation line direction is perpendicular to the slip \n \n plane normal and Burger\u2019s vector, which is along [121]  for this case.  Figure 1(b) is the pole \nfigure of this grain, with all <112> directions marked and the activated direction circled.  In this \nfigure, the x direction is along the electric current flow direction and the y direction is along the \n \n width direction of the Al line.  It is found that the dislocation direction [121]  is the direction \nbelonging to the <112> family and closest to the current flow direction.   \n \n  \n \n    \nFigure 1. (a) Simulated Laue patterns comparing with the experimental results, and (b) pole \nfigure of this grain with all <112> directions marked \n \n \n The activated slip systems in 30 grains have been analyzed in this way.  All the \ndislocations are found to be edge typed and about 90 % of the dislocation lines are contained \nwithin 5o with respect to the current flow direction.  The dislocations which don\u2019t obey this rule \nare located close to the cathode end.  We propose that the alignment of the edge type dislocations \nalong the electric current flow direction is resulted from the minimization of the electrical \nresistance because the scattering between electrons and dislocations is anisotropic.  The \ndislocations at the cathode end are not aligned regularly because electrons enter the Al line here \nand the electron motion directions are more disordered.  The realignment of dislocations will \nalso influence the atomic diffusion inside the line by affecting the diffusion route.  The detailed \nkinetic study is still underway and will be the subject of a forecoming paper.   \n \n  At higher tensile stress region, in other words, closer to the cathode, a secondary slip \nsystem can be activated, and the Laue patterns are broadened in two different directions, as \nshown in figure 2(a).  This grain is located at about 6 μm away from the cathode end.  In this \nexample, the two dislocation line directions are [112]  and [112] , respectively.  The pole figure of \n \n this grain, shown as figure 2(b), shows that, as expected, [112]  is the direction that is the closest \n \n to the current flow direction in <112> family, while [112]  is located on the edge of the circle in \n \n (a) (b)  \n  \n \n   \n the pole figure, which represent the XY plane, rather than the second closest direction.  At even \nhigher stress level, multiple slip systems are activated.  Figure 2(c) is the enlarged (113) peak of \na grain locating at about 2 μm to the cathode end.  The Laue diffraction patterns become \ncomplicated since dislocations slip in different orientations, as indexed in the figure.  \nFurthermore, the diffraction peak splitting suggests the formation of subgrains.  Since all those \nsubgrains have slightly different orientations, each subpeak in the Laue pattern represents a \nsubgrain in the irradiated volume in the sample.  From figure 2(d), which shows all the <112> \ndirections in this grain, it is clearly observed that one of the several activated dislocation line \ndirections is along the current direction, while the others are all within the XY plane.     \n \n  \n \n    \n \n    \nFigure 2. (a) Simulated Laue patterns of a grain which has two slip systems activated and (b) the \npole figure of this grain, (c) enlarged (113) diffraction peaks from a grain 2 μm to the cathode \nend showing the multiple activated slip system and subgrain formation and (b) the pole figure  \n \n The secondary slip system, which is within the XY plane, can be roughly explained by \nthe activation of the slip systems of the subgrains formed by EM.  Since each of the subgrains \nhas slightly different orientation and is subjected at different local shear stress status, the slip \nsystem activated within each subgrain could be different.  In other words, the secondary system \nis activated at a different location in the grain comparing with the primary system.  However, the \ndetailed mechanism is not well understood yet.   \n \n (a) (b) \n \n (d) (c) \n \n of this grain  \n  \n \n   \n Subgrain formation \n \n As mentioned above, polygonization happens on large grains close to the cathode by \nsubgrain formations, as indicated by the observation of the subpeaks in some Laue diffraction \npatterns.  In order to study this process, we have tracked the shape evolution of the Laue peaks of \nten grains in which subgrains were formed.  Figure 3 shows a series of (022) diffraction peaks \nproduced by the same grain after different period of EM test.  Before the EM test the peak is \ninitially sharp, indicating that there are not many dislocations in the grain.  As the EM test \ncontinues for 15 hours, the peak is broadened more and more in two directions, which indicates \nthat the grain is bended gradually by the electric current in two different directions, but generally \nthere are no obvious subpeaks in this period.  In figure 3(d), the diffraction peak becomes \nbroadened after 21.5 hours current stressing, and three subpeaks are observed, though not very \nclearly separated.  Thus at this stage, the dislocations are partially aligned to form the subgrain \nboundary.  After 25 hours EM test, two subpeaks can be very clearly observed and separated.  \nThe separation of the two peaks is larger than the maximum broadening in figure 3(d).  Both of \nthe two subpeaks are much sharper than the streaking in figure 3(d), indicating that most of the \ndislocations are concentrated and aligned at the subgrain boundary.   \n \n  \n \n  \nFigure 3. (022) diffraction peaks from the same grain after (a) 0 hr, (b) 6.5hr, (c) 15hr, (d) 21.5 \nhr, and (e) 25 hr EM test \n \n Generally, subgrain forms by the realignment of the dislocations when they reach certain \ndensity.  More detailed quantitative study, both experimentally and theoretically, is required to \nunderstand the kinetics of this procedure.      \n \n CONCLUSION \n \n In this paper, using polychromatic X-ray beam microdiffraction, we have studied the \nplastic deformation of the Al interconnect line induced by EM.  The activated slip systems have \nbeen studied from the shape change of the diffraction peaks.  It is found that all the dislocations \nare edge typed.  With relative low stress, only the slip system with the dislocation line direction \nwhich is the closest to electric current flow direction is activated while under high stress above \ncertain critical value, more slip system can be activated besides the one along the current \n \n I \n \n II \n \n III \n \n I \n \n II \n \n (a) (b) (c) (d) (e)  \n  \n \n   \n direction, and the secondary ones prefer to be within the XY plane.  Furthermore, the evolution \nof the diffraction peaks has been carefully studied.  The bending of the crystal plane indicated by \nthe elongation of the diffraction peaks and resulted from the rearrangement of the geometrically \nnecessary dislocations results in the peak splitting and subgrain boundary formation by the \nrealignment of the dislocations.    \n \n ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  \n \n The Advanced light Source is supported by the Director, Office of Science, Office of \nBasic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-\n05CH11231 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory \n \n \n REFERENCES \n \n 1.

We report the effects of bottom redundancy layers on \nelectrical line and via resistance and upstream electromigration performance. We studied 4 \nmetallization stacks:  (I) Ti/TiN/AlCu/Ti/TiN, (II) Ti/TiN/Ti/AlCu/Ti/TiN (annealed at 400oC \nfor 20 minutes), (III) a flash process/stack I, (IV) stack III with aluminum deposition temperature \nof 250oC. Aluminum deposition temperature in stacks I, II, and III are 200oC.  Bottom Ti/TiN, \nAlCu, and Top Ti/TiN layers have the same thickness for all these stacks. Metal line Rs and via \ncontact resistances (Rc) of stack IV are 5% and 10% lower, respectively, than stack I. Stack II \nmetal line sheet resistance is 15% higher than stack I, which is attributed to Al consumption in \nthe TiAl3 formation during 400\n \n oC/20minutes annealing. Electromigration performance is best \nwith stack IV followed by III, II, then I. \n \n  \n \n \n INTRODUCTION \n \n \n Aluminum interconnect technology is increasingly challenged at smaller technology \nnodes. While copper interconnect reliability has received much attention, most Analog/Mixed \nSignal applications are not being built in Cu due to cost [1]. Reducing thermal budgets, BEOL \nwiring/via requirements and defect density requirements have increased the manufacturing \nchallenges of building reliable aluminum wires. In particular, technologies that have thermal \nbudget constraints are limited in ways to improve electromigration resistance that do not increase \nmetal line resistances or put constraints on designers by requiring via redundancies or metal wire \nextensions. Doping of aluminum wires can improve electromigration performance, but at the \nexpense of metal line resistance. Annealing of wiring to allow for diffusion of dopant, grain \ngrowth or intermetallic formation, such as TiAl3, have all been demonstrated to improve \nelectromigration performance [2-4]. However such techniques are not practical in technologies \nthat have thermal constraints or where BEOL R-C performance requires the lowest possible wire \nand via resistances. Additionally, redundant vias and line extensions [5] can be used to extend \nEM lifetimes but at the expense of silicon area and may impart layout constraints.  \n \n In this study, we report the effects of the bottom redundancy layer on the \nelectromigration performance and wire/via resistances. \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1079 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1079-N09-01 \n  \n \n   \n   \n EXPERIMENT \n \n  Using a combined Cu and Al 180nm technology, electromigration and generic electrical \ntest macros (kerf) structures were fabricated on 200mm wafers. Wafer processing was started at \npoly-silicon (PC) through CA (W) contact, then M1 was processed with Cu damascene. A V1 \n(W) via in SiO2 connects to M1. M2 metallization experiments with the four metallization (I-IV) \nstacks were run. Table 1 provides the process descriptions for each stack. The aluminum \ncomposition is Al-0.5%wt Cu. All films were deposited by PVD in conventional DC Magnetron \nPVD equipment using planar sources. The aluminum deposition was temperature controlled \nusing an electrostatic chuck. All other metal films have no temperature control. The wafers were \ninitially degassed using lamp heating in a vacuum for water desorption. Stack III, IV used a 5 nm \noxide equivalent preclean prior to W deposition. Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of stacks \nI, II, and III, IV. \n \n                                                                              \n \n   \nTable 1, Process Description                                          Fig. 1, Schematic of M2 stacks I-IV \n \nWafers were exposed to ambient atmosphere between the W PVD deposition in stacks III, IV \nand the balance of the stack (air break). The top Ti/TiN was deposited in the same PVD chamber \nwith no target conditioning between wafers. The bottom Ti and TiN were deposited in separate \nPVD chambers. After M2 definition, a V2-M3 and final via/bond pad were built to replicate \nmanufacturing process flow. For stack II, the M2 was annealed post M2 etch. \n \n M2 Rs and V1 Rc were measured on kerf structures using M2 serpentines and M2-V1-\nM1 via chains, respectively. TEM analysis was conducted on structures to examine the wire to \nvia and wire to insulator interfaces. \n \n Electromigration was measured at M2 on minimum dimension, single via structures with \nno metal extensions over the vias [6]. The nominal M2 line is 0.28 μm wide and 200 μm long. \n \n  \nStack \n \n Process Description \n \n I \n150c degas, 15nm Ti, 20nm TiN, \n370nm Al @200c, 5nm Ti/70nm TiN \n \n II \n150c degas, 15nm Ti, 20nm TiN, \n10nm Ti, 370nm Al @200c, 5nm \nTi/70nm TiN \n \n III \n \n 250c degas, 5nm preclean, 10nm W, \n+ air break + \n250c degas, 15nm Ti, 20nm TiN, \n370nm Al @200c, 5nm Ti/70nm TiN \n \n IV \n \n 250c degas, 5nm preclean, 10nm W, \n+ air break + \n250c degas, 15nm Ti, 20nm TiN, \n370nm Al @250c, 5nm Ti/70nm TiN  \n  \n \n   \n The V1 diameter is 0.24 μm. Electromigration evaluations were carried out on all four stacks at \n250oC stress temperature and stress current densities between 10 to 15 mA/μm 2. Current flow is \nM1-V1-M2. Using 20% resistance increase (dR/R) as the failure criterion, the lifetime \ndistributions of all four stacks exhibit bi-modal behavior. The normalized lifetimes of the early \nmodes of three liner stacks are about 1X for stack I, 1.5X for stack II, 2X stack III and 3X for \nstack IV. \n \n \n RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \n \n  \n \n Metal Wire and Via Resistances \n \n Metal 2 Rs was measured on kerf structures. Figure 2 shows the effect of the stack \ncomposition on metal 2 wire resistance.  \n      \n \n            \n \n                  Fig. 2, Metal 2 Rs of Stacks I-IV                          Fig. 3, Via 1 Chain Rc of Stacks I-IV    \n \n  \nClearly, adding the Ti in Stack II increases the Metal 2 Rs. This is due to TiAl3 formation in the \nAl layer. The 5% improvement in Metal 2 Rs in Stack IV is due to the increased deposition \ntemperature of the Al from 200oC to 250oC .  \n Fig. 3 shows the V1 chain Rc by stack. A significant reduction in via 1 chain Rc is \nobserved when the top connection to the via is made with a W redundant layer (stacks III and \nIV). Usually, Ti is used to getter oxides from the top via surface to reduce via Rc, however our \ndata shows that a via exposed to an Ar preclean then capped with W has 10% lower via Rc than \nwhen using Ti. The W layer also provides a low resistance shunt. Stack IV produces the lowest \nvia Rc and lowest Al metal Rs. \n \n \n Electromigration Performance \n \n Electromigration lifetimes were evaluated on all four metal stacks at 250oC stress \ntemperature and stress current densities between 10 and 15 mA/μm 2. For a 20% resistance  \n  \n \n   \n increase as the failure criterion, the lifetime distributions of all four stacks exhibit bi-modal \nbehavior (Fig. 4a) since the fail distribution does not lie on a straight line. Stack II allows for a \nsingle mode and is due to continued reaction of Ti with Al forming TiAl3 driving resistance \nhigher. However, the t50 time for stack II is below the 2.0mA/μm 2. Failure analysis (Fig. 4b) \nsuggests that the two modes are differentiated by the void locations. For the early mode, the \nelectromigration voids are located immediately at the cathode end of the test line. In this case, \nonly the bottom redundant liner is left to carry current when the voids grow big enough to pass \nthe edge of the bottom W via. In contrast, the voids of the late mode fails are located somewhat \naway from the cathode end of the line beyond the via such that both the bottom and the top liners \nare able to shunt the electrical current after voids of late mode fails have grown to extend over \nthe entire AlCu cross sectional area. An inspection of Table 2 shows that the t50 times are \nimproved by ~1.5x and the sigma reduced by 50% using stack IV compared to stack I. The \nresistance versus time curves, R(t), Fig. 5, of stack I have more abrupt resistance increases at \nshorter electromigration stress durations than those of either stack II or stack III/IV. The R(t) \ncurve of stack II shows very good behavior, but, there is a resistance penalty of allowing titanium \nto react with aluminum. More accurately the stack II plot represents in part a resistance change \ndue to Ti reacting with Al resulting in shorter t50 times. The anneal conditions during processing \nfor stack II are not sufficient to convert all the Ti into TiAl3. The anneal limitation is imposed by \nthe presence of Cu wiring at M1. The R(t) plots of stack III/IV show very good stability, and \nperhaps some benefit to running at 250oC. Failure analysis of a fail with an abrupt resistance \nincrease (Fig. 6) after the 20% fail criteria has been reached shows a thermal runaway signature \nat the bottom redundant layer of stack I. This type of failure will cause a catastrophic failure in \nthe circuit. \n \n      \n            Fig. 4a EM lifetimes of Stacks I-IV                        Fig. 4b, Early and Late mode fail \n \n \nThe void characteristics and resistance time behavior of electromigration imply that the bottom \nliner plays the most critical role.  \n  \n  \n \n   \n      \n Fig. 5 Resistance vs time of Stacks I-IV                                  Table 2, t50, sigma \n  (all y axis 100-350 ohms, all x-axis 0-60 hours) \n  \n \n \n  \n \n Physical Analysis \n \nThere are no M2 extensions over V1 vias by design and the M2 wire is landed on a single \n \n via (Fig. 4b). Since the early mode fail is associated with the cathode end (void over the via) and \nthe bottom redundant layer carries all the current, improving the bottom redundant layer will \nimprove the early mode fail. Fig 4b shows the late mode fail with the void occurring away from \nthe via. Fig. 6 shows melting of the redundant layer. It is noted that the metal wire is \nforeshortened on the via by observing the chamfering of the via. Since the design calls for a \nsingle via contacted by a minimum dimension wire, and no extensions, foreshortening over the \nvia can occur. Clearly, the wire has failed. This suggests that the bottom Ti layer in Stack I is less \nconductive than designed for. Contamination of the bottom Ti with the V1 oxide is possible.  \nFig. 7 shows that the W redundant layer in an early mode fail is robust. Here too, the line is \nforeshortened on the via, meaning no connection is possible with the top redundant layer when \nthe void exposes the via.               \n \n                                \n       Fig. 6, Early Mode fail,     Fig. 7, W redundant layer intact \n          ruptured redundancy \n \n   \n  \n \n   \n EDX analysis of samples submitted for TEM show that the bottom titanium layer reacts \nwith the SiO2 insulator and in the early fail mode this results in earlier fail times. The reaction of \nthe Ti with the SiO2 results in a higher resistance redundant layer leaving less Ti cross section to \ncarry current. Fig. 8, 9 shows elemental analysis for the bottom layers of stack I and III, \nrespectively. It can be seen in Fig. 8 that oxygen is incorporated into the titanium, raising its \nresistance, while the tungsten, in Fig. 9 prevents reaction of titanium with the SiO2 interface.  \n \n \n  \n            Fig. 8, EDX analysis of stack I                            Fig. 9, EDX analysis of stack III \n \nThe Ti signal in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 includes both Ti and TiN from the bottom layers. Limiting the \nTi reaction with the oxide and providing a low resistance shunt to the via will improve the early \nmode fail time and improve the t50 time for EM resistance.  Fig. 9 shows Ti and Al in the W and \nis due to beam interference caused by the W layer. Fig. 10 shows a TEM with EDX scan of a \nfailed line over the stud using Stack I. The TEM shows TiAl mixing over the W stud. In \naddition, the TEM in Fig. 10 clearly shows the ruptured bottom redundancy adjacent to the stud. \nJoule heating results in a thermal runaway as void size increases. The resistance of the bottom \nredundancy is increasing as the void progresses away from the stud. As the void length increases, \nheat conduction is only through the bottom insulator resulting in thermal runaway [7]. This is \nseen as an electrical fail as in Fig. 5, Stack I, as shown by a near digital increase in wire \nresistance. \n \n \n  \n \n                              Fig 10, TEM/EDX of failure area, Stack I  \n  \n \n   \n CONCLUSIONS \n \n \n We have shown that in high performance aluminum interconnect structures the bottom \nredundant layer is the most critical factor in improving early mode electromigration failure. \nSpecifically, where thermal budget constraints exist, a \u2018No Anneal\u2019 metallurgy stack must be \nutilized, such as Ti/TiN/Al/TiN. This structure is common in the industry, but fails to meet EM \nrequirements where minimum ground rules exist. We have shown the benefit of using W as a \nfirst redundant layer to improve the electromigration lifetimes and to eliminate the possibility of \ncatastrophic circuit failure. The requirements, therefore, of a bottom redundant layer are to be \nchemically inert, and have a high melting temperature and low resistivity. \n \n  \n \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \nThe authors would like to thank Carl Farris for support in wafer fabrication, Chuck Cox for SEM \nand Phil Pokrinchak for TEM/EDX analysis and Chad M Burke, Kevin Lindstam and Randy \nAustin for EM testing support. \n \n  \n \n \n REFERENCES \n \n \n 1. http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=QH2WVHB4JSY2SQSNDLRSK\nH0CJUNN2JVN?articleID=205602370 \n \n 2.

The effects of O2 give an acceleration of the cure \nprocess, resulting in increased film modulus and shrinkage.  The use of NH3 resulted in a \nretardation of UV cure, explained by the higher absorption cross section of NH3 at the \nwavelengths used. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n \n UV curing of low-k films has received particular attention as a post deposition treatment \ndue to its ability to effectively improve film modulus [1] while removing porogen and retaining \nporosity, all with low thermal budget and little increase in k value [2].  In general increasing cure \ntime will result in increased modulus, eventually at the disadvantage of an increase in film k.  \nThis work will describe the use of oxygen addition to the cure process to achieve an accelerated \ncure process, enabling a targeted film modulus to be achieved with shorter cure time, with little \nor no impact on k value.   \n \nEXPERIMENT \n \n \n Three carbon doped SiOCH film types were used for this study.  The first was a porous \nSOG, prepared by a typical spin-on and soft bake process with target k=2.5.  The second was a \nPECVD non-porous film with target k=3.0.  The final film was a porous PECVD film formed by \nthe co deposition of a lattive and cyclic organic porogen material.  The removal of the porogen \nachieved the target k=2.5.   All films used were of nominal thickness ~ 10kA.  The cure process \nused the Axcelis RapidCure 320FC UV cure tool.  The process uses microwave driven \nelectrodless bulbs emitting UV radiation in the 100-400 nm range with the wafer temperature \nmaintained at 400oC with thermal chuck.  Standard process conditions used a constant purge of \nN2 gas at atmospheric pressure.  Oxygen additions to the ambient were set at 50 and 100 ppm in \nN2, while ammonia concentrations tested were 50, 100 and 750 ppm.  All tests were processed \nfor 3 mins, and compared to the cure process with N2 only ambient.  K values were determined \nusing Al shadow mask techniques. Mechanical properties were determined using an MTS \nnanoindentor XP.  Solid state Si29 MAS NMR was carried out on a Bruker Avance NMR \nspectrometer (11.7 Tesla, 500.2MHz, 4mm Zr O2 rotor @ 10kHz). \n \nDISCUSSION \nEffect of UV cure with N2 ambient \n \n \n Although cure of dielectric films is well documented, the effects of increasing cure time \nfor the films used in this work will first be summarized.  Figure (1) illustrates film shrinkage for \ncure times of 1, 3, 6 and 13 minutes for all three dielectrics studied.  The relative modulus and \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1079 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1079-N02-04 \n  \n \n   \n hardness increases for the SOG 2.5 and CVD 3.0 films, (Figure (2)) show a ~70% increase for \nthe CVD 3.0 and a 400-500% increase for the porous SOG 2.5 film when cured to 13 minutes.  \nEffects of UV cure on the FTIR properties of films are well known and typically show an \nincrease in the SiO network group along with loss of Si-CH3 moieties and reduction of the cage \nSiO peak.  In this work, the post\u0096pre subtracted spectra are used to allow the subtle changes in \nthe SiO network (~1050 cm-1) and SiO cage (~1050 cm-1) region to be measured, while the Si-\nCH3 (1273 cm\n \n -1)/SiO peak ratio loss follows Si-CH3 cleavage.  Detailed Si\n29 NMR spectroscopy \n \n for the SOG 2.5 and CVD 3.0 films is detailed elsewhere [3], showing a conversion of M and D \ngroups to Q and T with increasing cure time.   \n \n 0.0\n \n 2.0\n \n 4.0\n \n 6.0\n \n 8.0\n \n 10.0\n \n 12.0\n \n as dep 1 3 6 13\nCure Time (min)\n \n S\nh\n \n ri\nnk\n \n ag\ne \n \n (%\n)\n \n SOG 2.5\nCVD 3.0\n \n CVD 2.5\n \n  \nFigure (1): Shrinkage vs cure time of low-k films studied \n \n  \n \n 0.00\n \n 0.20\n \n 0.40\n \n 0.60\n \n 0.80\n \n 1.00\n \n 1.20\n \n 1.40\n \n 1.60\n \n 1.80\n \n 2.00\n \n as dep 1 3 6 13\n \n Cure Time (min)\n \n R\nel\n \n at\niv\n \n e \nC\n \n h\nan\n \n g\ne \n \n Relative Modulus Increase\n \n Relative Hardness Increase\n \n 0.00\n \n 1.00\n \n 2.00\n \n 3.00\n \n 4.00\n \n 5.00\n \n 6.00\n \n as dep 1 3 6 13\n \n Cure Time (min)\n \n R\nel\n \n at\niv\n \n e \nC\n \n h\nan\n \n g\ne\n \n Relative Modulus Increase\n \n Relative Hardness Increase\n \n CVD 3.0SOG 2.5 \n \n  \nFigure (2): Relative M and H increase vs cure time of SOG 2.5 and CVD 3.0  \n \n  \nEffect on UV cure through addition of O2 to the N2 ambient \n \n Addition of 50 and100ppm O2 to the N2 ambient POR (3min) results in increased \nshrinkage of up to ~75% for the porous SOG 2.5.  Shrinkage increases were less pronounced for \nthe p-CVD 2.5 and CVD 3.0 films (Table (1)).  Modulus increases were also significant for the \nSOG 2.5 film, showing values equivalent to those obtained at twice the time in a pure N2 \nenvironment.  Increases for the CVD 3.0 were more moderate at ~5% for both modulus and \nhardness.  (CVD 2.5 modulus and hardness results were not measured in this work) Control \ncures in pure N2 and 100ppm O2/ N2, both with no UV, show identical and negligible shrinkages.    \n  \n \n   \n Shrink (%) M (Gpa) H (Gpa) Shrink (%) M (Gpa) H (Gpa) Shrink (%) M (Gpa) H (Gpa)\n3min  (N2) 4.19 2.20 0.22 1.04 8.10 1.11 6.43 - -\n3min  50ppm O2 6.42 2.80 0.30 1.09 8.50 1.16 7.66 - -\n3min  100ppm O2 7.48 3.00 0.30 1.30 8.50 1.16 7.59 - -\n3min  (N2) (NO UV) 0.22 - -\n3min  100ppm O2 (NO UV) 0.24 - -\n \n CVD 3.0SOG 2.5 CVD 2.5\n \n  \n \n Table (1): Properties of UV cured low-k films in O2/N2 atmosphere \n \n \n Due to their porosity and susceptibility to dielectric damage, both k=2.5 films were examined, \nand showed no detrimental increase in k value.   \n \n 2.30\n \n 2.40\n \n 2.50\n \n 2.60\n \n 2.70\n \n 2.80\n \n 2.90\n \n 3.00\n \n 0 \npp\n \n m\n \n \n 50\n p\n \n pm\n O\n \n 2\n \n 10\n0p\n \n pm\n O\n \n 2\n \n k\n \n 2.30\n \n 2.40\n \n 2.50\n \n 2.60\n \n 2.70\n \n 2.80\n \n 2.90\n \n 3.00\n \n 0 \npp\n \n m\n \n \n 50\n p\n \n pm\n O\n \n 2\n \n 10\n0p\n \n pm\n O\n \n 2\n \n k\n \n CVD 2.5SOG 2.5 \n \n  \nFigure (3): k values of UV cured low-k films in O2/N2 atmosphere (3 min cure) \n \n  \nFTIR analysis for these two porous dielectrics show a decrease in Si-CH3/Si-O ratio with cure \n(Figure (4)), being notable and progressive for the SOG 2.5, while the CVD 2.5 film does not \nincrease with higher concentration of O2.

The maximum \nconcentration of oxygen usable without film damage will be a factor of film type, thickness, \npresence of porogen, temperature and UV source employed. The mechanism is proposed to be \ndue to the dissociation of oxygen, or ozone, under the UV wavelengths present as in equations \n(1) and (3) below.  The oxygen radical produced facilitates Si-CH3 cleavage, thereby \nencouraging greater Si-O networking.  Further support for this mechanism may be derived from \nthe increase of TOH (HOSiO3) species, formed by O\n \n \u0095 insertion into the H-SiO3 or cleavage of R-\nSiO3, potentially being the reason for the increase in k above. \n \n This mechanism is proposed to act on the SiOCH lattice, occurring most readily with the \nporous SOG 2.5 film.  The presence of the cyclic organic porogen in the CVD 2.5 is likely to \nhinder the catalytic effect of oxygen radical, resulting in the relatively lower shrinkage and SiO \nnetwork increases.  The insensitivity of this film to increasing oxygen concentrations may further \nsupport this. \n \n \n O2 + UV (180-240nm) � O\u0095 + O\u0095 (1)\n \n O3 + UV (200-320nm) � O\u0095 + O2 (3)\n \n O\u0095 + O2 + M O3 + M* (2)\n \n O3 + O\u0095� 2O2 (4) \n \nEffect of UV cure with additions of NH3 to the N2 ambient \n \n Controlled additions of ammonia at concentrations of 50, 100 and 750ppm in N2 were \nused in the UV cure of  SOG 2.5 and CVD 3.0 films.  The CVD 3.0 film, shrinkage results \nshowed little change with respect to the pure N2 (Table (3)).

The contrasting effects of O2 and NH3 are proposed to be due to their different absorption \ncross sections over the critical wavelengths used (170-220nm), with NH3 known to be orders of \nmagnitude larger than O2[4-5].  These literature values of absorption cross section can be used, \nalong with the path length within the UV cure tool, and the O2 or NH3 concentrations used to \nyield transmission curves over the wavelengths of interest.

A \nmechanism of oxygen radical formation and reaction with the SiOCH lattice is proposed.  \nConversely, addition of NH3 results in a mild retardation of cure, due to its absorption of \nwavelengths critical for effective UV cure. \n  \n  \n \n   \n [1] C.

The technique does not depend on the type of material development \nmethod or special thin film processing. Moreover, additional structures or calibrations are not \nrequired. The proposed method can be used to determine the loss of a thin film material using radio \nfrequency capacitance measurements in both parallel plate and interdigital topologies. An analytical \nformulation is given for the computation of the film loss based on its measured input impedance \nwhich is extracted from the measured scattering parameters. This technique is used for barium \nstrontium titanate (BST) thin film material characterizations.  \n \nIntroduction \n   \n          The change of dielectric parameters under a DC electrical field (tunability) opens the way for a \nnumber of very interesting enabling technologies. One type of the materials that is gaining more and \nmore importance are thin film where there is a strong interaction between the dc applied field and the \nmaterials electrical properties that could be translated into innovative components and circuits \narchitectures. Among the different thin film materials that exist today, barium strontium titanate \n(BST) is employed due to its tunability at room temperature which finds great potential applications to \nassist microwave tunability. \n \n         Integrated barium strontium titanate voltage-controlled capacitors are core components in \ntunable RF and microwave devices such as voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs) [1,3], tunable filters \n[4,5], phase shifters [6,7], and tunable matching networks [8]-[9]. A varactor with high quality factor \nand large tuning range is a mandatory prerequisite to meet the requirements of high tunable \ncomponents specifications [10]. The quality of the BST thin film depends on its processing conditions \nsuch as temperature, thickness and substrate [11]. However, the development of BST growth \nconditions for optimizing its film losses demands a standard characterization method. The losses in \nBST thin films are due to: \n \n\u2022 Lattice oscillations of ions in the crystalline network. \n\u2022 BST growth conditions (oxygen vacancies, grain boundaries, extended defects). \n\u2022 Type of the deposition method (grain size and shape). \n\u2022 Thickness of the film. \n\u2022 The dielectric constant. \n \nWhereas the full stack losses in BST based components are due to: \n \n\u2022 BST film losses. \n\u2022 Substrate coated dielectrics losses. \n\u2022 Metallization loss. \n\u2022 Films defected interface. \n\u2022 The inherent crystallographic incompatibility of two materials. \n \nInterdigitated capacitor structures were achieved by lift-off process [12]. The structure has 16 fingers \nof width 3.5μm, length of 100μm and spacing of 3.5μm. The Ba0.6Sr0.4TiO3 thin films were deposited \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc.

Thus 0R can be computed by solving \n(17). \n \n \n  \n \n Measurements and Analysis \n \n \nThe device consisting of two independent tunable capacitors with common ground has been measured \nusing a network analyzer. The two interdigited capacitors have been activated by applying a DC bias \non the signal lines. The two capacitors are isolated from each other by more than 45 dB which is good \nenough to decouple them. Hence, any information about the device performance, material \ncharacterizations, and modeling are constructed from its reflection coefficients. \n \n \n  \nFigure 2: The |S11 | reflection coefficient and the circuit model \n \n \n \n Figure 2 shows the measured reflection coefficients of the device. The tunability is more pronounced \nat higher frequencies due to the value of the tuned capacitance which exhibits a low value. The BST \ntuning mechanism exhibits unavoidable losses at high frequency, thus limiting their based devices \nperformances as shown in Fig. 3. The limitation of device quality factor due to its ohmic losses can be \navoided by thicker metallization. The extracted BST film losses using (17) is shown in Fig. 4. As the \nfrequency increases the losses decrease. The 5 GHz resonance could result from computational errors. \nFigure 5 shows the losses around the range of interest. \n \n \n   \n  \n \n   \n 10� 20� 30� 40� 50�\n0,0�\n \n 0,2�\n \n 0,4�\n \n 0,6�\n \n 0,8�\n \n 1,0�\n \n 1,2�\n \n 1,4�\n \n  �\n \n D\niff\n \n er\nnt\n \n ia\nl l\n \n os\nse\n \n s \n[o\n \n hm\ns]\n \n �\n \n Frequency [GHz]�\n \n  \n \n Figure 3: Introduced losses by BST tuning mechanism \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n 10� 20� 30� 40� 50�\n-2,0k�\n \n 0,0�\n \n 2,0k�\n \n 4,0k�\n \n 6,0k�\n \n 8,0k�\n \n 10,0k�\n \n 12,0k�\n \n 14,0k�\n \n 16,0k�\n \n  �\n \n In\ntr\n \n in\nsi\n \n c \nlo\n \n ss\n [o\n \n hm\ns]\n \n �\n \n Frequency [GHz]�\n \n  \n \n Figure 4: BST film losses at zero bias \n  \n  \n \n   \n 1,00� 1,25� 1,50� 1,75� 2,00� 2,25� 2,50� 2,75� 3,00�\n100�\n \n 200�\n \n 300�\n \n 400�\n \n 500�\n \n 600�\n \n 700�\n \n 800�\n \n In\ntr\n \n in\nsi\n \n c \nlo\n \n ss\n [o\n \n hm\ns]\n \n �\n \n Frequency [GHz]�\n \n  \n \n Figure 5: Intrinsic losses around the interest frequency range \n \n \n  \n \n Conclusion \n \nSimple characterization method for tunable thin films is presented in this paper.

Optimized dispersion procedure was set up to obtain improved mechanical and electrical properties. Apparent modulus and electrical contact resistivity for CNT-epoxy composites were correlated with different dispersion solvents for CNT. CNT-epoxy composites using good dispersion solvent showed higher apparent modulus because of better stress transferring effect due to relatively uniform dispersion of CNT in epoxy and enhanced interfacial adhesion between CNT and epoxy matrix. However, good solvent showed high apparent modulus but low thermodynamic work of adhesion, Wa for single carbon microfiber/CNT-epoxy composite. It is because hydrophobic high advanced contact angle was shown in good solvent, which can not be compatible with carbon microfiber well. Damage sensing was also detected simultaneously by AE combined with electrical resistance measurement. Electrical resistivity increased stepwise with progressing fiber fracture due to the maintaining numerous electrical contact by CNT."    },

Optimized dispersion procedure was set up to obtain improved mechanical and electrical properties. Apparent modulus and electrical contact resistivity for CNT-epoxy composites were correlated with different dispersion solvents for CNT. CNT-epoxy composites using good dispersion solvent showed higher apparent modulus because of better stress transferring effect due to relatively uniform dispersion of CNT in epoxy and enhanced interfacial adhesion between CNT and epoxy matrix. However, good solvent showed high apparent modulus but low thermodynamic work of adhesion, Wa for single carbon microfiber/CNT-epoxy composite. It is because hydrophobic high advanced contact angle was shown in good solvent, which can not be compatible with carbon microfiber well. Damage sensing was also detected simultaneously by AE combined with electrical resistance measurement. Electrical resistivity increased stepwise with progressing fiber fracture due to the maintaining numerous electrical contact by CNT. \n (Received June 15 2008) \n (Accepted July 10 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t sensor;  \n\t microelectro-mechanical (MEMS);  \n\t electrical properties \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t \t  How to Cite This Article \n\t\t\t\t \n\t  Link to This Abstract \n\t\t \n\t  Blog This Article \n\t\t \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCopy and paste this link  Highlight all \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\thttp://dx.doi.org/10.1557/PROC-1075-J05-04\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tCitation is provided in standard text and BibTeX formats below.\n\t\t\t\t\t Highlight all \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBibTeX Format\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t@inproceedings{OPL:7990188,\nauthor = {Park,Joung-Man and Jang,Jung-Hoon and Wang,Zuojia and Kim,Pyung-Gee and Lee,Woo-Il and Park,Jong-Kyoo and DeVries,Lawrence K.},\ntitle = {Dispersive Evaluation and Self-Sensing of Single Carbon Fiber/CNT-Epoxy Composites using Electro-Micromechanical Techniques},\nbooktitle = {Symposium J \u2013 Passive and Electromechanical Materials and Integration},\nseries = {MRS Proceedings},\nvolume = {1075},\nyear = {2008},\ndoi = {10.1557/PROC-1075-J05-04},\nURL = {http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1946427400031043},\n}\n\n\t\t\t\tClick  here  for full citation export options.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBlog This Article\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\tBlog This Article\n\t\t\t\t\t:\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t Highlight all \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div style=\"background: #FFFFFF; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; padding: 0 10px 0 0; text-align: left; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 1em;\"><div style=\"font-size: 11px; padding: 0px 0px 10px 0px; font-weight:bold; color: #045989;\">Dispersive Evaluation and Self-Sensing of Single Carbon Fiber/CNT-Epoxy Composites using Electro-Micromechanical Techniques<\/div><div style=\"font-size: 11px;\"><b>Joung-Man Park,Jung-Hoon Jang,Zuojia Wang,Pyung-Gee Kim,Woo-Il Lee,Jong-Kyoo Park and Lawrence K.

,"description":"Self-sensing and interfacial evaluation were investigated with different dispersion solvents for single carbon fiber/carbon nanotube (CNT)-epoxy composites by electro-micromechanical technique and acoustic emission (AE) under loading/subsequent unloading. Optimized dispersion procedure was set up to obtain improved mechanical and electrical properties. Apparent modulus and electrical contact resistivity for CNT-epoxy composites were correlated with different dispersion solvents for CNT. CNT-epoxy composites using good dispersion solvent showed higher apparent modulus because of better stress transferring effect due to relatively uniform dispersion of CNT in epoxy and enhanced interfacial adhesion between CNT and epoxy matrix. However, good solvent showed high apparent modulus but low thermodynamic work of adhesion, Wa for single carbon microfiber/CNT-epoxy composite. It is because hydrophobic high advanced contact angle was shown in good solvent, which can not be compatible with carbon microfiber well. Damage sensing was also detected simultaneously by AE combined with electrical resistance measurement. Electrical resistivity increased stepwise with progressing fiber fracture due to the maintaining numerous electrical contact by CNT.","coins":   [

    {"values":"Four samples of (Y1y Gay)5O12 (where x=0.01, 0.02 and y=0, 0.5) were synthesized via the simple, efficient combustion synthesis method in order to determine the effect of substituting Ga3+ for Al3+ on the temperature-dependent fluorescent lifetime. X-ray diffraction shows that the Ga-doped samples have longer lattice constants and transmission electron microscopy data show that each sample consists of nanocrystallites which have agglomerated in micron-sized particles. Photoluminescence data reveal that the addition of gallium into the YAG:Ce matrix induces a red shift in the absorption spectra and a blue-shift in the emission spectra. The laser-induced fluorescent lifetime was determined as a function of temperature over the range of 0-125°C using two different emission filters. Increasing the amount of dopant ultimately results in a decrease of the fluorescent lifetime. The quenching temperatures for the Ga-doped samples were lower than the samples without gallium. The results of this work show that combustion synthesis is viable method for making highly luminescent, nanocrystalline TGPs. In addition, these results show that the quenching temperature of YAG:Ce can be altered by substituting ions which alter the location of the charge transfer state and by changing the morphology of the sample."    },

X-ray diffraction shows that the Ga-doped samples have longer lattice constants and transmission electron microscopy data show that each sample consists of nanocrystallites which have agglomerated in micron-sized particles. Photoluminescence data reveal that the addition of gallium into the YAG:Ce matrix induces a red shift in the absorption spectra and a blue-shift in the emission spectra. The laser-induced fluorescent lifetime was determined as a function of temperature over the range of 0-125°C using two different emission filters. Increasing the amount of dopant ultimately results in a decrease of the fluorescent lifetime. The quenching temperatures for the Ga-doped samples were lower than the samples without gallium. The results of this work show that combustion synthesis is viable method for making highly luminescent, nanocrystalline TGPs. In addition, these results show that the quenching temperature of YAG:Ce can be altered by substituting ions which alter the location of the charge transfer state and by changing the morphology of the sample. \n (Received March 17 2008) \n (Accepted July 28 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t crystalline;  \n\t sensor;  \n\t dopant \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t \t  How to Cite This Article \n\t\t\t\t \n\t  Link to

,"description":"Four samples of (Y1y Gay)5O12 (where x=0.01, 0.02 and y=0, 0.5) were synthesized via the simple, efficient combustion synthesis method in order to determine the effect of substituting Ga3+ for Al3+ on the temperature-dependent fluorescent lifetime. X-ray diffraction shows that the Ga-doped samples have longer lattice constants and transmission electron microscopy data show that each sample consists of nanocrystallites which have agglomerated in micron-sized particles. Photoluminescence data reveal that the addition of gallium into the YAG:Ce matrix induces a red shift in the absorption spectra and a blue-shift in the emission spectra. The laser-induced fluorescent lifetime was determined as a function of temperature over the range of 0-125°C using two different emission filters. Increasing the amount of dopant ultimately results in a decrease of the fluorescent lifetime. The quenching temperatures for the Ga-doped samples were lower than the samples without gallium. The results of this work show that combustion synthesis is viable method for making highly luminescent, nanocrystalline TGPs. In addition, these results show that the quenching temperature of YAG:Ce can be altered by substituting ions which alter the location of the charge transfer state and by changing the morphology of the sample.","coins":   [

    {"values":"In this paper we present results on the optimization of multilayered a-SiC:H heterostructures for wavelength-division (de) multiplexing applications. The non selective WDM device is a double heterostructure in a glass/ITO/a-SiC:H (p-i-n) /a-SiC:H(-p) /a-Si:H(-i')/a-SiC:H (-n')/ITO configuration. The single or the multiple modulated wavelength channels are passed through the device, and absorbed accordingly to its wavelength, giving rise to a time dependent wavelength electrical field modulation across it. The effect of single or multiple input signals is converted to an electrical signal to regain the information (wavelength, intensity and frequency) of the incoming carriers. Here, the (de) multiplexing channels is accomplished electronically, not optically. This approach has advantages in terms of cost since several channels share the same optical components; and the electrical components are typically less expensive than optical ones. An electrical model gives insight into the device operation"    },

The non selective WDM device is a double heterostructure in a glass/ITO/a-SiC:H (p-i-n) /a-SiC:H(-p) /a-Si:H(-i')/a-SiC:H (-n')/ITO configuration. The single or the multiple modulated wavelength channels are passed through the device, and absorbed accordingly to its wavelength, giving rise to a time dependent wavelength electrical field modulation across it. The effect of single or multiple input signals is converted to an electrical signal to regain the information (wavelength, intensity and frequency) of the incoming carriers. Here, the (de) multiplexing channels is accomplished electronically, not optically. This approach has advantages in terms of cost since several channels share the same optical components; and the electrical components are typically less expensive than optical ones. An electrical model gives insight into the device operation \n (Received May 14 2008) \n (Accepted May 18 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t microelectronics;  \n\t photoconductivity;  \n\t optoelectronic \n

,"description":"In this paper we present results on the optimization of multilayered a-SiC:H heterostructures for wavelength-division (de) multiplexing applications. The non selective WDM device is a double heterostructure in a glass/ITO/a-SiC:H (p-i-n) /a-SiC:H(-p) /a-Si:H(-i')/a-SiC:H (-n')/ITO configuration. The single or the multiple modulated wavelength channels are passed through the device, and absorbed accordingly to its wavelength, giving rise to a time dependent wavelength electrical field modulation across it. The effect of single or multiple input signals is converted to an electrical signal to regain the information (wavelength, intensity and frequency) of the incoming carriers. Here, the (de) multiplexing channels is accomplished electronically, not optically. This approach has advantages in terms of cost since several channels share the same optical components; and the electrical components are typically less expensive than optical ones. An electrical model gives insight into the device operation","coins":   [

Sec. 4, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan \n \nABSTRACT \n \n \n A Si-rich SiOX strip-loaded waveguide with silicon (Si) nanocrystal contributed amplified \nspontaneous emission at 750-850 nm with the associated spectral linewidth of 140 nm is \ncharacterized. By using the variable stripe length (VSL) method we demonstrate the optical gain \nand loss coefficients of 65 and 5 cm-1, respectively, for such a waveguide amplifier. The optical \ngain and loss coefficients are observed by fitting the one dimensional amplifier equation. The \nsmall-signal power gain of 18.4 dB at the wavelength of 805 nm under He-Cd laser pumping of \n40 mW at 325 nm is obtained from the SiO2/SiOX/SiO2 waveguide amplifier with a length of 1 \ncm. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n \n Prior to the development of nano-synthesis technology, Si was never considered as a \ncandidate for light emitters owing to its indirect electronic bandgap characteristics. Over the last \ntwo decades, versatile low-dimensional Si structures including nanocrystallite Si [1-2], porous Si \n[3], Si/insulator superlattices, and Si nano-pillars etc. with intensive luminescence and optical \ngain have been demonstrated [1]. The first observation on optical gain of silicon nanocrystal was \nproposed by Pavesi and co-workers, while the net modal gain coefficient of the silica waveguide \nwith buried Si nanocrystal synthesized by Si+-ion implantation was determined as 100 cm-1 [1]. \nLater on, Luterova and co-workers also observed the optical gain and loss coefficient of 25 and \n15 cm-1 [3], respectively, for the porous SiO2 nanograins embedded in SiO2 deposited by the \nsol-gel method. However, the gain of Si nanocrystal synthesized within the SiOX film grown by \nthe PECVD method was seldom addressed, in which the density of Si nanocrystal is reported to \nbe the highest among all mentioned samples. The concept and fabrication of all Si-based \nphotonic integrated circuitry become achievable on such a mainstay semiconductor in \nmicroelectronic circuitry by employing Si based materials as alternative candidates for light \nemission. The aforementioned Si structure in a low-dimensional form, or the Si substrate with \nselected active impurities (such as erbium) inserted into Si lattice [4-5], or new composite phases \n(such as iron disilicide). In principle, the physical mechanism underlying the high external \nquantum efficiencies for photoluminescence in low-dimensional Si is mainly attributed to the \nquantum confinement of excitons in the nano-scale crystalline Si matrix. With the rapid \nevolution on the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) grown Si-rich SiOX film \ncontaining dense Si nanocrystal, the development of low-dimensional Si nanocrystal based \nnear-infrared luminescent materials and light emitting diodes have recived much attention during \nthe past decade. More recently, many claims on the future role for Si in photonic applications \nwith versatile optical device configurations have emerged, such as waveguides [2], ring \nresonators [6], ring disks filters [7], arrayed-waveguide gratings [8], etc. However, the Si based \nwaveguide amplifiers and lasers have not yet been completely realized, still remaining an \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1076 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1076-K05-02 \n  \n \n   \n uncertain issue toward the all-Si-based photonic integrated circuitry. Particularly, the SiO2 \nstrip-loaded waveguide structure which exhibits better optical mode confinement than the \nconventional planar waveguide geometry has never been employed to investigate the SiOX with \nburied Si nanocrystal. In this work, we design and fabricate the strip-loaded waveguide with \nburied Si nanocrystal and determine the optical gain coefficient of Si nanocrystal. The Si-rich \nSiOX film was grown upon the quartz substrate by using PECVD and annealed in a quartz \nfurnace with flowing N2 to precipitate Si nanocrystal. Afterwards, we will discuss the amplified \nspontaneous emission (ASE) spectrum of the Si-rich SiOX strip-loaded waveguide under He-Cd \nlaser pumping of 40 mW with a wavelength of 325 nm. The VSL method is used to observe the \noptical net model gain and loss coefficient by fitting to the one dimensional amplifier equation. \nThen, we will demonstrate the small-signal amplification in the Si nanocrystal strip-loaded \nwaveguide. The Si nanocrystal has such high optical gain coefficient, and the Si substrate based \ncharacteristic, that these findings could lead the way to a Si based laser. \n \nEXPERIMENT \n \n \n First of all, the single-mode strip-loaded waveguide is simulated to observe the \nconfiguration parameters for the SiO2/SiOX:nc-Si/SiO2.

In our case, nnc-Si = 1.8, nSiO2 = 1.46 at the wavelength of 800 nm  \n  \n \n   \n corresponding to a photoluminescence (PL) peak. We calculated that the thickness of SiOX:nc-Si \nlayer for single-mode confinement can be widely tunable from 0 to 380 nm. Afterwards, the \nstrip-loaded waveguide structure shown in figure 2 was determined except for the design of the \nwidth and height of SiO2 strip. The width of strip must be sufficiently large, on the order of 50 \nµm, to ensure that the strip pattern will not be over-etched during the wet-etching process. The \nsimulation software, Beam Propagation Method (BPM), supported by R-Soft Company is \nemployed to confirm the height of the strip and to simulate the output mode field, which helps us \nto achieve optimized optical confinement within the waveguide structure.  \n \n  \n \n   \nFigure 3.

The height of the strip region \nhas a minimum value, if the height is smaller than the minimum value, the optical power leaks to \nthe air region. The width of the strip region has a maximum value, if the width is larger than the \nmaximum value, it becomes multi-mode. Figure 4 shows the cross-sectional view of the index \nprofile, in which the refractive index of SiO2 is 1.46, the refractive index of SiOX is 1.80 and the \nrefractive index of air region is 1.00.

Figure 6 shows the cross-sectional view of the simulation on \nthe confined fundamental mode, the power of the fundamental mode vanishes at heights of 1.3 \nµm above the quartz substrate, and the height of the SiO2 strip needs to be around 1 µm. For \nlarger tolerance, we chose the height of the SiO2 strip to be 1.5 µm. The optical power is \nconfined in the SiOX:nc-Si region when the optical signal and ASE are confined in the active \nregion. \n \n In the experiment, we fabricated a single-mode strip-loaded waveguide with buried Si \nnanocrystal on a 2 cm-square quartz substrate. First of all, the Si-rich SiOx film was grown upon \nthe quartz substrate by using PECVD with anomalous SiH4/N2O fluence ratio of 0.15 for 8 \nminutes and substrate temperature of 350oC. After deposition, the SiOx film with a thickness of \n350 nm was annealed in a quartz furnace with flowing N2 at 1100\n \n oC for 90 min to precipitate Si \nnanocrystal. Subsequently, the SiO2 film was grown upon the SiOx film by using PECVD with \nanomalous SiH4/N2O fluence ratio of 0.25 for 20 minutes yielding a thickness of the SiO2 film of \nabout 1.5 µm. Then, photolithography processes were performed on the sample using a mask \npattern that is 50 µm wide and 3 cm long. The sample was wet etched by buffered oxide etching \n(BOE) resolution for 20 minutes and then the photo resist was removed by acetone. Finally, we \ncleaved the sample with a dicing saw to get the input and output ends. \n \nRESULTS \n \n \n Figure 7 shows the top view of the strip structure sample imaged by an optical microscope. \nFigure 8 shows the surface profile of the strip-loaded waveguide sample measured by alpha step, \nthe height is about 1.5 µm, the width of the top of the strip is about 40 µm and the width of the \nbottom of the strip is about 50 µm. The trapezium structure is due to the wet etching process and \nthe side angle is approximately 16.7o. \n \n  0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130-200\n0\n \n 200\n \n 400\n \n 600\n \n 800\n \n 1000\n \n 1200\n \n 1400\n \n 1600\n \n  \n \n V\ner\n \n ti\nca\n \n l(\nn\n \n m\n)\n \n Horizontal (µm)  \nFigure 7.

The Amplified \nSpontaneous Emission (ASE) intensity is received at the waveguide edge by a fiber with a 400 \nµm core and is then characterized by an optical spectrum analyzer. By moving the slit, the \npumping length is changed, and we obtain the different ASE intensities. Figure 11 shows the \nASE spectrum gathered by the VSL method. The ASE spectrum ranges between 750-850 nm \nwith the central wavelength of 805 nm and the 3 dB spectral linewidth of 140 nm. Figure 12 is \nthe complete experimental setup. We used a UV lens to expand the laser beam and a UV mirror \nto reflect the laser beam on the top to pump the waveguide. The UV cylindrical lens can focus \nthe laser beam in one dimension.

Under the pumping wavelength of 325 nm \nand power of 40 mW, a net model gain coefficient of up to 70 cm-1 contributed by the Si \nnanocrystal is reported. The gain coefficient is fitting to the waveguide length dependent ASE \nintensity, corresponding to a power gain of 18.4 dB at the wavelength of 805 nm. \n \n  \n \n 0 2 4 6 8 10\n0\n \n 500\n \n 1000\n \n 1500\n \n 2000\n \n 2500\n \n 3000\n \n 3500\n \n  805nm\n Gain Fitting\n Loss Fitting\n \n In\nte\n \n n\nsi\n \n ty\n(a\n \n .u\n.)\n \n Pumping Length (mm)  \n680 720 760 800 840 880 920\n \n 0.0\n \n 0.2\n \n 0.4\n \n 0.6\n \n 0.8\n \n 1.0\n \n In\nte\n \n n\nsi\n \n ty\n(a\n \n .u\n.)\n \n Wavelength(nm)\n \n  PL\n ASE of 10mm\n \n  \nFigure 14.

The linear IASE curve at longer pumping length region \noccurs due to the gain saturation effect, obtained the Si nanocrystal strip-loaded waveguide loss \ncoefficient of 5 cm-1 from experiments. The large loss coefficient is because of Si nanocrystal \nscattering. This results in the total gain coefficient of up to 70 cm-1. Such a high gain coefficient \nobtained from Si nanocrystal based waveguide is premier and is attributed to the optimization of \nSi-rich SiOX film via PECVD growth. The small-signal power gain of 18.4 dB at the wavelength \nof 805 nm under He-Cd laser pumping of 40 mW at 325 nm is obtained from the SiO2/SiOX/SiO2 \nwaveguide amplifier with a length of 1 cm. \n \n 700 750 800 850 900\n0\n \n 500\n \n 1000\n \n 1500\n \n 2000\n \n 2500\n \n 3000\n \n 3500\n \n 800 810 820 830\n0.990\n \n 0.995\n \n 1.000\n \n In\nte\n \n n\nsi\n \n ty\n(a\n \n .u\n.)\n \n Wavelength(nm)\n \n  1mm\n 2mm\n 3mm\n 4mm\n 5mm\n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  680 720 760 800 840 880 920\n0\n \n 2000\n \n 4000\n \n 6000\n \n 8000\n \n 10000\n \n 700 750 800 850\n0\n \n 1000\n \n 2000\n \n 3000\n \n 4000\n \n 5000\n \n 6000\n \n In\nte\n \n n\nsi\n \n ty\n(a\n \n .u\n.)\n \n Wavelength(nm)\n \n  780nm Laser Signal\n ASE Spectrum\n Pumped Signal\n \n  Input\n Output\n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nFigure 16.

The small signal pumped \nspectrum. \n \n  \nFigure 15 shows the normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of Si nanocrystal and the \n \n ASE spectrum, the peak wavelength is red shifted about 6 nm from the non-guiding structure to \nthe guiding structure. It is because of the waveguide structure that the luminescent wave is \nguided in the strip-loaded waveguide; only the specific mode can be confined in the waveguide. \nThe wavelength of the ASE guided mode is 6 nm different to the spontaneous emission. Figure \n16 shows the normalized ASE spectrum of Si nanocrystal with different pumping length. The \npeak wavelength of ASE spectrum is blue shifted with longer pumping lengths. Because of the \nlonger pumping length, the mode guiding is stronger and the peak wavelength becomes stable. \nFigure 17 shows the small signal pumped spectrum, we focused a 780 nm laser signal into the \nstrip-loaded waveguide cleaved end. The waveguide is pumped with a wavelength of 325 nm \nand power of 40 mW. Then we collected the output signal which was amplified about 1.03 times. \n \n In an earlier investigation [1], the higher net model gain coefficient was reported to be about \n100 cm-1. It is caused by the density of Si nanocrystal and the red shift in the ASE peak \nwavelength. With a higher density of Si nanocrystal, the quantum confinement effect becomes \nstronger and leads to higher optical gain of the Si nanocrystal waveguide. In addition, the red \nshift of the ASE peak wavelength means that there are some luminescent wave losses when \npropagating in the SiOX strip-loaded waveguide. On the other hand, the loss of Si nanocrystal \nwas reported to be about 9 cm-1,[9] which is caused by the size of Si nanocrystal ranging from 2 \nto 5 nm in diameter, and also caused by the interface loss at both coupling end-facets. Due to the \nSi nanocrystal with a larger size in our sample of about 5 nm, the scattering effect in the SiOX  \n  \n \n   \n waveguide is inevitably larger than previous reports. Moreover, the slightly large surface \nroughness of the film grown by PECVD will introduce additional interface scattering loss. \n \n  \n \n 700 750 800 850 900\n0\n \n 1000\n \n 2000\n \n 3000\n \n 4000\n \n 5000\n \n 6000\n \n 7000\n \n In\nte\n \n n\nsi\n \n ty\n(a\n \n .u\n.)\n \n Wavelength(nm)\n \n  785nm Laser Signal\n 40.0mW Output\n 40.0mW ASE\n 32.8mW Output\n 32.8mW ASE\n 22.5mW Output\n 22.5mW ASE\n 10.6mW Output\n 10.6mW ASE\n 1.63mW Output\n 1.63mW ASE\n \n  \n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\n \n 15.0\n \n 15.5\n \n 16.0\n \n 16.5\n \n 17.0\n \n 17.5\n \n 18.0\n \n 18.5\n \n 19.0\n \n G\nai\n \n n\n (\n \n d\nB\n \n )\n \n Pumping Power (mW)  \nFigure 18.

The relationship between the pumping power \nand the optical gain is linear, the optical gain coefficient is higher with higher pumping power. \nThe higher pumping power provides more energy to excite the electrons and stimulates emission \nfrom the conduction band to the valence band. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \n \n In conclusion, we fabricated the strip-loaded waveguide with buried Si nanocrystal and \ndetermined the optical gain coefficient of the Si nanocrystal to be about 70 cm-1. The optical net \nmodel gain and loss coefficient are 65 cm-1 and 5 cm-1 respectively. The ASE spectrum ranges \nfrom 750 to 850 nm with the central wavelength of 805 nm and the 3dB spectral linewidth of 140 \nnm. The ASE spectrum is red shifted 6 nm to the PL spectrum because of mode guiding. The \npeak wavelength of the ASE spectrum is blue shifted with longer pumping lengths. Because of \nthe longer pumping lengths, the mode guiding is stronger and the peak wavelength becomes \nstable. The Si nanocrystal have such a high optical gain coefficient of 70 cm-1, and the Si \nsubstrate based characteristic, that these findings could lead the way to a Si based laser. The  \n  \n \n   \n small-signal power gain of 18.4 dB at the wavelength of 805 nm under He-Cd laser pumping of \n40 mW at 325 nm is obtained from the SiO2/SiOX/SiO2 waveguide amplifier with a length of 1 \ncm. The relationship between the pumping power and the optical gain is linear, and the optical \ngain coefficient is higher with higher pumping power. \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n \n This work was supported in part by the National Science Council (NSC) of the Republic of \nChina under grants NSC96-2221-E-002-099 and NSC97-ET-7-002-007-ET. \n \nREFERENCES \n \n  \n1.

The investigation takes includes both the \neffect of dielectric film thickness as well as the effect of metal contacts. The investigation \ndemonstrates that the charging process is asymmetric. It is shown that the amount of stored \ncharge depends significantly on the dielectric film thickness, which is caused from the \ncontribution of the space charge polarization mechanism. Finally, the results are compared with \nthose of higher temperature silicon nitride.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n \n Capacitive RF MEMS switches are one of the most promising applications in \nmicroelectromechanical systems (MEMS). In spite of this, their commercialization is still \nhindered by reliability problems regardless of almost 10 years studies by a lot of laboratories and \ncompanies. The most important reliability problem is the charging of the dielectric [1, 2]. On the \nway to solve the problem of dielectric charging, several materials have been investigated, such as \noxides (SiO2, Al2O3, Ta2O5 etc) [3-7] and nitrides (Si3N4 and AlN) [8-14]. Among those the most \nintensively investigated ones are the SiO2 and Si3N4. In contrast to the great experience on their \nelectrical properties, stemming from semiconductor technology, these materials still cannot \nprovide a successful solution on the problem of dielectric charging. This can be attributed to the \nfact that in MEMS the dielectric films are deposited on rough substrates, the low temperatures, \nthat lead to significant deviation from material stecheometry and the presence of hydrogen \nintroduced during growth.  \n \n The charging of the dielectric film arises from dipoles orientation and charge trapping \nthat occurs under the strong electric field during the ON state of MEMS switches [12]. Recent \nexperiments have shown that the charge injection mechanism is dominated by the Poole-Frenkel \neffect [15]. On the other hand it has been shown that in the case of silicon nitride the injected \nholes introduce metastable traps [16, 17]. These metastable defects affect the charge transport  in \nthe dielectric [18] and the Poole-Frenkel coefficient [19]. Finally, the defects introduced in α-\nSi:H are expected to take place also in SiN, due to strong deviation from stecheometry [17, 20], \nand give rise to asymmetrical current-voltage characteristic in symmetrical Metal-Insulator-\nMetal capacitors [20]. \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1075 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1075-J05-05 \n  \n \n   \n In view of these problems the aim of the present work is to investigate the electrical \nproperties of low temperature silicon nitride and compare them with those of conventional, for \nMEMS, one. The investigation employed symmetrical and asymmetrical MIM capacitors with \ndifferent dielectric film thicknesses. The experimental results clearly show that the asymmetry \ndue to metastable trap introduction is significantly reduced in low temperature material. It is also \nshown that the asymmetry is reduced even in asymmetrical structures. The stored charge is found \nto depend on the film thickness and differ significantly from the one stored in higher temperature \ndeposited films. \n \n Table I.

The dielectric film was deposited at 150°C with high frequency PECVD \nmethod. Another set of 250°C SiN devices were fabricated for comparison. Capacitors with \ndielectric film ranging from about 100nm to 600nm and symmetrical or asymmetrical metal \ncontacts have been fabricated. Table I lists the different MIM layer structures. The charging \nprocess was investigated by applying the Thermally-Stimulated-Depolarization-Current (TSDC) \nmethod [21] with the aid of Keithley 6487 picoampere meter in the range of 200K to 450K. This \nallowed the calculation of stored charge, the analysis of various charging mechanism and their \ndependence on the film thickness, bias polarity and metal-insulator contacts. The TSDC spectra \nwere obtained after freezing the charging process under polarization with an electric field of 106 \nVolt/cm. Finally, the heating rate was β=2.5 K/min, the MIM top contacts diameter was 2mm \nand the terms positive and negative, presented in all TSDC spectra, refer to the polarity of the top \nelectrode. \n \nDISCUSSION  \n \nIn MEMS switches the charge induced at the moving electrode surface is given by \n \n \n d-z\n10\n \n 1\n \n PzV +−= εσ                                                              (1) \n \nwhere z1 is the thickness of the dielectric, z the bridge distance from the coplanar transmission \nline when no bias is applied, d the bridge displacement, and P the average macroscopic  \n  \n \n   \n polarization. The stiction of a MEMS switch occurs when the dielectric polarization/surface \ncharge induces a charge σ1 that gives rise to electrostatic force greater than the pull-in one. It is \nwell known that the dielectric polarization arises from two basic mechanisms, the dipolar and the \nspace charge ones [12].  \n \n \n eSCiSCD PPPP −− −+=                                                        (2) \n \nwhere PD is the dipolar polarization, PSC-i and PSC-e the space charge polarization of intrinsic and \nextrinsic origin respectively. The dipolar polarization, in the case of a homogeneous material, \ngives rise to surface bound charges and does not depend on the dielectric film thickness. On the \nother hand the space charge polarization gives rise to a distribution of charges in the dielectric \nfilm hence it is expected to depend on the film thickness. \nIn insulators, the time and temperature dependence of polarization and depolarization processes \nare determined by the competition between the orienting action of the electric field and the \nrandomizing action of thermal motion. The depolarization process in a MIM capacitor will \ninduce a short circuit discharge current transient. Moreover, the current density (JD) produced by \nthe progressive decrease in polarization in the course of TSDC experiment, where time and \ntemperature is simultaneously varied, is approximated by \n \n \n ( ) ( )\n⎥\n \n ⎦\n \n ⎤\n \n ⎢\n \n ⎣\n \n ⎡\n \n ⎟\n \n ⎠\n \n ⎞\n \n ⎜\n \n ⎝\n \n ⎛−⋅−⋅\n⎟\n \n ⎠\n \n ⎞\n \n ⎜\n \n ⎝\n \n ⎛−⋅≈\nkT\n \n E\nexp\n \n E\n \n kT\n \n βτ\n \n 1\nexp\n \n kT\n \n E\nexp\nτ\n \n TP\nTJ A\n \n A\n \n 2\n \n 0\n \n A\n \n 0\n \n pS\nD                             (3) \n \n  \n \n 200 250 300 350 400 450\n \n 0.0\n \n 0.5\n \n 1.0\n \n 1.5\n \n 2.0\n \n 2.5  Ti - Si\n3\nN\n \n 4\n - Ti +10V\n \n  Ti - Si\n3\nN\n \n 4\n - Ti -10V\n \n  Au - Si\n3\nN\n \n 4\n - Ti +10V\n \n  Au - Si\n3\nN\n \n 4\n - Ti -10V\n \n  \n \n  \n|I T\n \n S\nD\n \n C\n|  \n \n    \n   \n \n    \n  [\n \n p\nA\n \n ]\n \n T            [K]\n \n d = 120nm\n \n 100 200 300 400 500 600\n0.0\n \n 5.0x10-9\n \n 1.0x10-8\n \n 1.5x10-8\n \n 150C   250C\n    Positive\n    Negative\n \n Q\n   \n \n    \n[C\n \n ]\n \n d          [nm]  \n                                       (a)                                                                        (b) \nFigure 1.

The TSDC spectra for the symmetrical structure clearly show \nthat the introduced defects due to current injection exhibit a rather symmetrical distribution. This  \n  \n \n   \n is also confirmed from the calculation of stored charge for the symmetrical structure. Since the \nheating rate is constant, the TSDC spectrum allows the calculation of stored charge:  \n \n \n ( )\n∫\n \n = T2T1 TSDC dTTI\nβ\n \n 1\nQ                                                         (4) \n \n  \n Figure 1a shows the evolution of typical TSDC spectra for symmetric and asymmetric \nstructures and positive/negative bias applied to top with respect to bottom electrode. The \ncomparison of experimental results show that the TSDC current is larger for asymmetrical than \nfor symmetrical structures and when electrons are fed from bottom contact. This is a trend is \nfollowed in all samples. The observed behavior can be understood by taking into account the \ndifferent metal work functions and the fact that the first deposited layers of SiN include more \ndefects than the overlaying ones. Regarding the contact work functions, they are about 5.2eV and \n4.2eV for Au and Ti respectively [22] while the Si3N4 electron affinity is about 1.8eV [23] and \nthe band gap is assumed to be about 5.0eV although depending on stecheometry deviation it may \ndecrease significantly. According to these it is much easier to inject holes (ΔEh,Au≈1.6eV) than \nelectrons (ΔEe,Au≈3.4eV) into SiN from the Au electrode while there is no significant difference \non injecting holes (ΔEh,Ti≈2.6eV) or electrons (ΔEe,Ti≈2.4eV) from the Ti electrode. Taking \nfurther into account that in SiN the current transport arises from motion of holes via silicon \ndangling bond-defect states [19], the density of states increases near the electron injection \nelectrode in α-Si:H [20] and that the same is expected to hold for SiN [16, 19] and finally that the \nnitride bottom layers are expected to contain more defects than the upper ones we are led to the \nconclusion that: \n \n 200 250 300 350 400 450\n0.0\n \n 0.5\n \n 1.0\n \n 1.5\n \n 2.0\n \n Ti - Si\n3\nN\n \n 4\n - Ti \n \n V = +10 volt\n \n  \n \n  \nI T\n \n S\nD\n \n C\n   \n \n    \n   \n \n    \n [\n \n p\nA\n \n ]\n \n T                [K]\n \n d = 120nm\n \n 200 250 300 350 400 450\n0.0\n \n 0.5\n \n 1.0\n \n 1.5\n \n 2.0\n \n 2.5 Au - Si\n3\nN\n \n 4\n - Ti \n \n V = +10volt\n \n  \n \n  \nI T\n \n S\nD\n \n C\n   \n \n    \n   \n \n    \n [\n \n p\nA\n \n ]\n \n T          [K]\n \n d = 120nm\n \n  \n                         (a)                                                                                        (b) \nFigure 2. Decomposition of TSDC spectrum from a (a) symmetric and (b) asymmetric\n \n   \ni. In both structures the electrons injection through top electrode creates defects which in turn \nincrease the total number of defects in the film hence the stored charge. The electrons injection \nthrough the bottom electrode introduces defects in already defective region. This seems to \nincrease less the total number of defects in the film hence the stored charge. \nii. The behavior of the symmetric structures is attributed to the only existing asymmetry, the \nhigher defect concentration in the lower SiN layers while \n \n MIM capacitor.   \n  \n \n   \n iii. The behavior of the asymmetric structure is more complex. There, when the top electrode is \nnegative, the injection of holes through the Au bottom is easier, larger charge will be trapped in \nthe defective region and the electrons injected through the top electrodes will increase locally the \ndensity of states. These simultaneous actions contribute to maximization of the stored charge. \nWhen the bias is reversed the electron injection through bottom Au electrode is much lower than \nin previous case. Therefore, the increase of DOS will be significantly reduced and the stored \ncharge will be determined from the trapped electrons and holes. The fact that the stored charge \nratio is practically the same for both bias polarities can be attributed to the presence of large \namount of defects in the lower SiN layers, which will increase the probability of direct tunneling \nof electrons into empty traps that lay above Fermi level [24].  \n The stored charge, calculated with (4), was found to increase for both the 150°C and \n250°C SiN with the dielectric film thickness (figure 1b). Even more, the experimental result \nrevealed lower charge storage in the low temperature material with respect to the higher \ntemperature one, which is in good agreement with the reported behavior of SiN grown at low \ntemperatures too [25]. Finally, since presently there is no model on the charge distribution the \ncurves in Figure 1b were added to show the charge-film thickness trend. \n The decomposition of TSDC spectra, using (1), revealed the presence of several charging \ncontributions. The influence of the metal contact on the TSDC spectra in Figure 2a and b reveals \nthat these contributions to dielectric charging arise from space charge polarization that leads to \nquite important variation in the formation and release of excess carriers due to the differences in \nwork function and blocking factor. Obviously the dipolar polarization is not affected by the work \nfunction of metal contacts. Finally, the high temperature regime was found to be governed by a \ncharging mechanism that is characterized by high concentration of dipoles or traps, for the case \nof dipolar or space charge polarization mechanisms respectively. Since the scanned temperature \nwas not large enough to allow the recording or the peak, hence to allow the accurate \ndetermination of fitting parameters in (3), we plotted the TSDC current vs 1000/T for various \nthickness SiN films in Figure 3. The plot shows that in all samples the current follows Arrhenius \nlaw, above 280K, with activation energy of 0.24eV.  \n \n 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0\n10-13\n \n 10-12\n \n 10-11\n 630nm\n 320nm\n 110nm\n \n  I T\nS\n \n D\nC\n \n    \n   \n \n [A\n]\n \n 1000/T\n \n EA = 0.24eV\n \n  \nFigure 3.

The dielectric \ncharging was fund to increase with the film thickness. These characteristics are in good \nagreement with the reported performance in MIS capacitors. The modeling of the dependence of \ncharging on film thickness is an issue that requires further study since the charge distribution is \nunknown. In both the low and high temperature materials the charging is dominated by space \ncharge polarization that is directly affected by the nature of metal contacts. Finally, in the high \ntemperature range, in the low temperature material, the stored charge increases with activation \nenergy of 0.24eV.  \n \n  \n \n \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n \n The authors wish to acknowledge the support from the Hellenic GSRT in the frame of \nScientific and Technological Cooperation between TRD Organizations in Greece and RTD \nOrganizations in U.S.A. under the contract No. 05-NON-EU-212 and the IMPACT Center for \nAdvancement of MEMS/NEMS VLSI, funded by DARPA, through Grant No. HR0011-06-1-\n0046, under the DARPA N/MEMS Science and Technology Fundamentals Research Program. \n \nREFERENCES \n \n1.

Compared with passive optical and active radar/microwave instruments, \nlidar systems produce substantially more accurate and precise data without reliance on natural \nlight sources and with much greater spatial resolution. NASA pursues lidar technology not only \nas science instruments, providing atmospherics and surface topography data of Earth and other \nsolar system bodies, but also as viable guidance and navigation sensors for space vehicles. This \npaper summarizes the current NASA lidar missions and describes the lidar systems being \nconsidered for deployment in space in the near future.   \n  \nCURRENT SPACE-BASED LIDARS \n \n \n Presently, NASA has four major lidar instruments in space with another to be launched \nlater this year. The ICESat (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite) and CALIPSO (Cloud-\nAerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) are Earth science missions \nproviding valuable atmospheric data and monitoring global climate changes [1-4]. The other \nthree instruments are part of planetary missions: Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) as part of the \nMESSENGER (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) mission \n[5], Mars Meteorological Lidar onboard Phoenix Lander and Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter \n(LOLA) onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. Table 1 summarizes the high-level \nspecifications of these instruments and their launch dates. All these instruments utilize diode-\npumped Nd:YAG laser as their transmitter source and incorporate some level of redundancy by \nusing backup lasers to ensure long operational lifetime in space.   \nTable 1.

The 532-nm \nbeam profiles the atmospheric aerosols, while the 1064-nm beam is used for denser aerosol \nplumes, clouds or ground targets. ICESat lidar uses its 1064-nm beam to measure the height of \nthe polar ice sheets and monitor its changes over time. Changes in ice sheet elevations are an \nimportant indicator of the global climate change and influence the global sea level, which can \nhave profound impact on life on Earth. CALIPSO uses both laser wavelengths for collecting \nspatially resolved clouds and aerosols data. The combination of the signal returns at 1064-nm \nand two orthogonal polarizations of 532-nm radiation allows the scientists to extract information \nabout cloud water and ice content, and aerosol concentration and its sources. The improved \ninformation on global coverage of clouds, their altitudes, and their water and ice contents is \ncritical to better weather forecasting and more accurate climate models. The atmospheric \naerosols also affect weather and global climate changes. Aerosols can both reflect the sunlight \naway from Earth, causing the atmosphere to cool and absorb the sunlight, warming the \natmosphere depending on aerosol concentration and composition. Figure 1 illustrates the \nCALIPSO instrument and its measurements of atmospheric aerosols and clouds. CALIPSO \npayload also includes an Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR) and a Wide Field Camera (WFC) to provide \nadditional data for determining the cloud emissivity and ice particle size distribution.  \n \n Unlike ICESat and CALIPSO, the Mars Meteorological Lidar onboard Phoenix operates \nfrom a stationary platform on the ground looking upward. The Mars Meteorological Lidar \nmeasures the atmospheric aerosol concentration and CO2 ice clouds that can lead to a better \nunderstanding of Mars climate and atmospheric processes. The laser altimeter instruments (MLA \nand LOLA) orbiting Mercury and the moon simply measure the distance to the surface as they \norbit. The data collected after a large number of orbits enable the development of global three-\ndimensional topographical maps. \n \n ICESat and CALIPSO have been in Earth orbit since 2003 and 2006, respectively, and \nare continuing to operate and transmit data. MESSENGER (MErcury Surface, Space \nENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) made its first flyby of Mercury in January 2008, \nmaking lidar measurements of the planet\u2019s surface. The lidar onboard MESSENGER is expected \nto operate well beyond 2011 when the spacecraft settles in Mercury\u2019s orbit after flybys in \nOctober 2008 and September 2009. The Mars Meteorological Lidar is expected to provide \nclouds, fogs, and dust plumes data leading to be better understanding of the Mars climate after \nthe successful recent landing of Phoenix spacecraft in May 2008. \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n   \n Telescope \nSunshade \n \n Integrated \nLidar \n \n Transmitte\n \n Wide \nField \n \n Camera \n \n Star Tracker \nAssembly \n \n X-Band \nAntenna \n \n Imaging \nInfrared \n \n Radiomete\n \n Laser 1 \n \n Laser 2 \n \n Payload \nintegration at \nBall \nAerospace and \nTechnologies \n \n A pictorial \nrepresentation \nof the lidar \nmeasurements \n \n  \n \n Figure 1.

These applications fall into \nfour general categories:  \n \n a) Earth Science: long-duration orbiting instruments providing global monitoring of the \natmosphere and land  \n \n b) Planetary Science: orbiting or land-based scientific instruments providing geological \nand atmospheric data of solar system bodies \n \n c) Landing Aid: sensors providing hazard avoidance, guidance and navigation data \n \n d) Rendezvous and Docking Aid: sensors providing spacecraft bearing, distance, and \napproach velocity  \n \n  \nEarth Science Applications \n \n \n Earth science reliance on lidar technology is clearly revealed in a National Research \nCouncil (NRC) report published in 2007, entitled \u201cEarth Science and Applications from Space: \nNational Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond\u201d [6]. This report reflects the scientific \ncommunity's consensus and is regarded very seriously by NASA planners. It provides a list of 15 \nrecommended missions for NASA to implement over the next decade. Seven of the 15 are based \non lidar instruments, with the remaining missions divided between passive optical, radar and \nmicrowave instrument technologies. This fact reflects the scientific community's belief that the \nability of lidar to provide highly accurate atmospheric data on a global scale can profoundly help  \n  \n \n   \n climate research. Table 2 lists the lidar missions recommended by the NRC and provides their \nassociated cost, estimated by the NRC panel, reflecting their relative complexity.  \n \n Some of the NRC recommended lidar mission concepts are based on previously flown \ninstruments but strive for higher accuracy, resolution and coverage than their predecessors. \nICESat-II and ACE are two such missions that will be built upon the experiences and successes \nof ICESat and CALIPSO missions. However, most of the NRC recommended lidar missions \nrepresent new measurements requiring considerably more complex instruments than previously \nflown. For instance, the three-dimensional Wind Lidar will use highly spectral pure pulsed lasers \nto allow extraction of wavelength Doppler shift resulting from atmospheric aerosols and \nmolecules in motion with the wind. Therefore, the high-pulse energy transmitter laser has to \nemploy an elaborate cavity control mechanism and then use a separate stable, single frequency, \ncontinuous-wave laser as a injection-seeding source. Furthermore, a wind lidar requires precision \npointing of the transmitted laser beam in several different directions to allow for extraction of the \nhorizontal components of vector wind velocity. Precision scanning of the laser beam and \ncollecting the returned radiation using an aperture of greater than 50 cm will be a major \nchallenge [7,8].  \n \nTable 2.

In addition to the missions discussed earlier, NASA will continue deployment of \nlaser altimeters orbiting various solar bodies. Specifically, we are planning to launch the Lunar \nOrbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) later this year. LOLA is expected to orbit the moon for at least \ntwo years and provide a three-dimensional surface map of the entire lunar surface. This \ninformation will be critical in landing site selection and designing the future robotic and manned \nlanding missions to moon.   \n  \n \n   \n The application of lidar technology for understanding the Mars atmosphere is starting to \nattract the attention of NASA scientists. The NASA report, \u201cMars Scientific Goals, Objectives, \nInvestigations, and Priorities,\u201d prepared in 2006, outlines a series of measurements critical to \nunderstanding the Mars atmosphere and search for evidence of life. Many of these measurements \n\u2013 including atmospheric density variations, seasonal and diurnal cycles, aerosol concentration \nprofiles, and detection of water vapor \u2013 are best achieved by lidar instruments.  \n \nPlanetary Landing Applications \n \n \n Landing aid is another important application of lidar technology in space. Future \nplanetary exploration missions will require safe, precision soft-landing to target scientifically \ninteresting sites near hazardous terrain features, such as escarpments, craters, slopes and rocks. \nAlthough the landing accuracy has steadily improved over time to approximately 10 km for Mars \nlanding and 1 km for the moon, a drastically different guidance, navigation and control concept is \nrequired to meet future mission requirements. For example, future rovers will require better than 1 \nkm landing accuracy for Mars and better than 30 m for the Moon. Laser radar or lidar technology \ncan be key to meeting these objectives because it can provide high-resolution three-dimensional \nmaps of the terrain, accurate ground proximity and velocity measurements, and it can determine \natmospheric pressure and wind velocity in the case of Mars landing [9-11]. These lidar \ncapabilities can enable the landers of the future to identify the preselected landing zone and \nhazardous terrain features within it, determine the optimum flight path, and accurately navigate \nusing precision ground proximity and velocity data. \n \n Currently, NASA is actively advancing the lidar technology for future lunar landing \nmissions through its Autonomous Landing and Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT) \nproject. This program is developing three-dimensional imaging and Doppler velocity lidar \ntechnologies as part of the landing guidance, navigation and control system. The lidar sensors \nbeing developed under ALHAT will enable safe soft-landing of large robotic, cargo and crewed \nvehicles with a high degree of precision at the designated landing site under any lighting \nconditions.  \n \nRendezvous and Docking Application \n \n \n The future crew exploration vehicle, which is to replace the space shuttle and be used for \na crewed mission to the moon, may rely on a lidar sensor for its rendezvous and docking \nmaneuvers. The lidar technique is being considered for providing critical distance, approach \nvelocity, and relative orientation of the docking port during the rendezvous and docking \nmaneuver. The precision and frequent update rate offered by the lidar could be key for mating \nthe vehicle with the International Space Station and, in the case of the human mission to the \nmoon, for mating the lunar crew module with the Earth re-entry vehicle that will be awaiting it in \nthe moon orbit.  \n \n  \n \n \n SUMMARY \n \n \n The lidar technology will play an increasingly important role in NASA\u2019s plan. Lidar will \nbe used for a wide range of applications both as a scientific instrument and as a GN&C sensor in \nmany future NASA space missions. Despite past successful lidar missions, deployment of laser  \n  \n \n   \n systems in space remains a very challenging task. This challenge is further evidenced by the \ndemand for increasing accuracy with higher coverage measurements and the requirement of a \nnumber of new measurements leading to considerably complex lidar instruments.   \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \n1.

We investigated properties and performance of {111} and \n{100} textured, dense films deposited by sol-gel techniques in the frequency range of 1 to 2 \nGHz. The resonators were fabricated on Si wafers using deep silicon etching to create a \nmembrane structure and using platinum as top and bottom electrodes. The best response of the \nresonators was observed for {111} textured films at a bias voltage of -15kV/cm with values of \naround 10% for the coupling constant and around 50 for the quality factor. This voltage \ncorresponds to the maximal value of the piezoelectric constant d33 and minimal value of the \ndielectric permittivity measured as a function of the electric field. Resonance and antiresonance \nfrequencies were strongly influenced by a bias voltage, showing a hysteretic behaviour as \nexpected for ferroelectrics. Both of these frequencies shifted in the same direction. As a \nconsequence, the dc voltage can be potentially used to shift the whole band of a filter. In unipolar \noperation, the coupling constant could be varied from 6 to 10 %. Materials parameters were \nextracted from the admittance as a function of frequency. Dielectric, piezoelectric and elastic \nproperties of textured PZT films are reported and compared to direct (low frequency) \nmeasurements and to literature values. It was found that PZT thin films have lower stiffness than \nthe one of PZT bulk ceramics and it was observed that {111}-textured films are stiffer than \n{100}-textured films.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n The high performance of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filters in mobile communication \napplications ensures great interest in these devices and their active piezoelectric material. When \ncomparing with surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters, BAW filters offer superior power handling, \nsmaller size, higher application frequencies [1] and easier system-on-chip integration [2], or even \nabove IC integration [3]. Standard materials used as the piezoelectric active layer in thin film \nbulk acoustic resonators (TFBAR) are AlN and ZnO. Both exhibit high quality factors but \nrelatively low electromechanical coupling coefficients, resulting in small filter bandwidths. The \nPb(Zr, Ti)O3 (PZT) solid solution system has high coupling coefficients and is thus being studied \nas a candidate for high frequency broadband filter applications [4]\u0096[8]. The drawback of PZT, in \ncontrast to AlN and ZnO, is the observed high acoustical attenuation of the material; to date PZT \nin BAW resonators have too low quality factors. This acoustical attenuation or damping and its \ndependence on frequency have been discussed for PZT ceramics [9]. In this paper, the \nfabrication of thin film bulk acoustic resonators based on PZT shall be described and the relevant \nproperties of the piezoelectric films shall be characterised. The influence of a bias applied to the \nresonators shall be studied and also field dependencies of dielectric and piezoelectric \ncoefficients. Materials properties shall be derived from impedance measurements and the \nproperties of {111}-textured films and {100}-textured films shall be compared. \n \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1075 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1075-J03-03 \n  \n \n   \n EXPERIMENT \n \nTFBAR Fabrication \n \n \n  Thin Film Bulk Acoustic Wave Resonators with a double resonator membrane structure \n[10] according to Figure 1 were designed and fabricated for a resonance at around 1-2GHz using \nPZT as the piezoelectric layer (thickness 1-2µm). The substrates used were Si (001) wafers \ncovered with 100nm of thermal oxide. A Ti/TiO2 (2nm/10nm) adhesion layer was sputter \ndeposited onto the substrate prior to the deposition of the 100nm Pt bottom electrode. The \nbottom electrode was patterned by dry etching and subsequently the PZT film was deposited on \ntop by spin coating with a sol-gel solution. A TiO2 (2nm) or a PbTiO3 (20nm) seed layer was \nsputter deposited onto the bottom electrode to promote the {111} or {100} orientation of the sol-\ngel PZT film, respectively [11]. The preparation of the sol-gel solution and of PZT thin films has \nbeen described in previous publications [12, 13].  After the deposition of the 1-2µm thick PZT \nfilm the Pt top electrode (100nm) was sputter deposited and structured by dry etching. To \nliberate the membrane the wafer was structured and dry etched (deep silicon etching, Bosch \nprocess) from the back side. Resonator devices with dimensions ranging from 30µm to 60µm \nwere obtained. \n \n  \nFigure 1 Schematic cross-section of a TFBAR with double resonator membrane structure \n \nTFBAR and PZT Characterisation \n \n The resonators were characterised by measuring the frequency response using an HP \n8722D network analyser (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The S11 scattering parameters \nobtained from these measurements were used to calculate the electrical admittance Y. To observe \nthe influence of the polarisation of the films on the response of the resonators the network \nanalyser was equipped with a voltage source used for biasing the samples. Capacitance \nmeasurements were performed using an impedance meter. X-ray theta- 2theta measurements \nwere done to check the film orientation. Film morphology was analysed using scanning electron \nmicroscopy (SEM, LEO 1550). The piezoelectric measurements were done using a double beam \nlaser interferometer as described in reference [14].  \n \nDISCUSSION  \n \nNumerical Simulations \n \n The admittance data obtained from the measurements of the S11 scattering parameter \nusing the network analyser were simulated using the linear equations of piezoelectric elasticity \n[15] for a one-dimensional case. To achieve an optimal fit of the admittance data the resistivity \nRs and inductance Ls of the electrodes need to be taken into account. In [15] the electrical \nimpedance was expressed in terms of piezoelectric materials properties and the impedances of  \n  \n \n   \n the mechanical loads of the resonator. Using the expression derived in [15] (see equation 1) the \nresonators where modeled taking the electrodes and the SiO2 layer into account. \n \n Z = 1\niωC0\n \n 1− K 2 tanφ\nφ\n \n (zr + zl ) ⋅ cos\n2 φ + i ⋅sin 2φ\n \n (zr + zl ) ⋅ cos 2φ + i(zrzl +1)sin 2φ\n \n ⎛ \n \n ⎝ \n⎜ \n⎞\n \n ⎠\n \n ⎟\n \n       (1) \n \n where ω = 2πf is the angular frequency, t the thickness of the piezoelectric film, φ= ω t/vD with \nvD = √(c33D/ρ) being the sound velocity, c33D is the elastic stiffness at constant electric \ndisplacement and ρ is the density of the piezoelectric material. The coupling constant K2 is given \nby K2= kt\n \n 2 /(1+ kt\n2) where kt\n \n 2 is the coupling constant appearing in the electric field/strain system \nfor pure thickness mode vibration. The latter can be calculated using materials parameters as \nfollows (see equation 2): \n \n kt\n2 = e33\n \n 2\n \n c33\nD ⋅ε33S\n \n            (2) \n \n where e33 is the piezoelectric constant and ε33S is the clamped dielectric permittivity. Material \nlosses were included in the model by adding complex terms to the clamped capacitance C0, the \nelastic stiffness and the dielectric constant [16]. All structures attached to the piezoelectric \nresonator need to be included in the mechanical load impedances zl and zr, which are the \nterminating impedances at the left side and at the right side of the structure, respectively [14]. In \nFigure 2 an example of typical impedance data of a resonator with {111} textured PZT with the \ndimensions of 60µm x 60µm measured with an applied bias of -15kV/cm is plotted as a function \nof frequency. The numerical values used for this simulation are compared to values obtained \nfrom measurements of devices with {100} textured films in Table I. The table also includes \ncalculated values for Q-factor, coupling constant kt\n \n 2 and piezoelectric coupling constant d33,f. \nThe dielectric and piezoelectric constant derived from these measurements shall be compared to \ndirect measurements of these values in the following paragraph. This model using materials \nparameters allows for the determination of stiffness constant of specific orientations of PZT \ngrains. The stiffness values obtained for thin film PZT are lower than values reported for bulk \nPZT (PZT4: c33\n \n D\n =150GPa, PZT 3203: c33\n \n D\n =177GPa [17]), and it was found that {111} textured \n \n films are clearly stiffer than {100} textured films (see Table 1). Some values for the stiffness of \nPZT thin films have been previously reported [5,18], but none relating orientation with stiffness. \n \n  \nFigure 2 Frequency response of a PZT TFBAR shown as real and imaginary part of the \nadmittance characteristics.

PZT with a composition at the morphotropic phase \nboundary (MPB) is known to have high piezoelectric response [19]. It has also been observed \nthat PZT {100} oriented films show larger piezoelectric coefficients than {111} oriented films \n[12]. Scanning electron microscope reveals a columnar grain structure with grain sizes ranging \nfrom 50 to 150nm. From the C(V) characteristics at 1kHz the dielectric constants for the {111} \nand {100} textured films were calculated and plotted against the electric field in Figure 5a). \nTypical hysteresis loops of the piezoelectric constant versus electric field are presented in Figure \n5b). This data was measured using a modified Mach-Zender interferometer [14] with an AC field \nof 0.1V and 5KHz and a superimposed DC field up to 20kV/cm. The value of the piezoelectric \ncoefficient d33 at zero fields is around 60 pm/V for both {111} and {100} textured films. This \ncorresponds to values reported previously on films with similar compositions such as [20] and \n[21]. The difference between measured values and values derived from one-dimensional \nimpedance equation model (see Table I) could be caused by a more efficient poling on the \nliberated membrane as compared to the fully clamped film. As can be seen from equation 3 to \nget a high coupling coefficient a high piezoelectric coefficient and a low dielectric coefficient are \nneeded. The best response was found when applying -15kV/cm on a device with a {111} \ntextured film, which corresponds to the maximal value of the piezoelectric constant d33 (Figure \n5a) and minimal value of the dielectric permittivity (Figure 5b) as a function of the electric field. \n \n  \n  a)      b) \nFigure 5 a) Dielectric and b) piezoelectric constants d33 as a function of electric field for {111} \nand {100} textured films \n  \n  \n \n   \n Hysteresis effects \n \n The resonator admittance data were collected as a function of electric DC bias. \nResonance and antiresonance frequencies were extracted from the admittance and plotted against \nthe DC field for a device with {111} textured PZT (Figure 6a)). Both frequencies show a strong \ndependence on the bias field and reflect the ferroelectric hysteresis. From zero to 20 kV/cm the \nresonance curve drops by 3.4%, while the antiresonance drops by 2.1%. The drop of the \nantiresonance curve is much larger than the thickness change calculated from d33,f as 0.14%, \nmeaning that the stiffness constant c33\n \n D is reduced by the effect of an electric field along the \naverage polarization. Similar hysteresis effects previously reported by Schreiter et al [4] have \nbeen discussed in a previous publication [22]. As described in [4] the coupling constant can be \nvaried from zero to its maximum value. Figure 6b) shows the bias dependency of the coupling \nconstant derived from impedance data at varying frequencies. We obtained a maximal kt\n \n 2 of \n9.0%, identical to values reported in [4] for PZT 52/48 and higher Zr concentrations. Restricting \nto unipolar bias voltages, a range of kt\n \n 2 from 6 to 9% is exploitable. \n \n  \n  a)     b) \nFigure 6 Frequency dependence of resonance and antiresonance frequencies a) and coupling \nconstant b) for a TFBAR with {111} textured PZT \n \n \n CONCLUSIONS \n \n Thin film bulk acoustic resonators (TFBAR) based on {111} and {100} textured sol-gel \nPZT with a composition of Zr/Ti=53/47 were designed and fabricated with a resonance \nfrequency around 1-2GHz. Dielectric, piezoelectric and electro-acoustic properties of the films \nwere studied and hysteretic behaviour of resonance frequency, antiresonance frequency and \ncoupling constant were observed. The values of dielectric and piezoelectric constants were found \nto correspond to state of the art values. The TFBAR structure also allowed to extract materials \nconstants of the PZT films and it was found that the stiffness of both the {111} and {100} \ntextured films (c33\n \n D) is lower than for bulk PZT and that the {111} textured film is stiffer than \nthe {100} textured film. The optimal response of fabricated resonators was observed for the \n{111} textured film with an applied bias voltage of -15 kV/ cm, which corresponds to the \noptimal values of dielectric and piezoelectric constant as a function of electric field. Interesting \nfor filter applications is the fact that fa and fr move about the same amount when applying a bias \nvoltage. As a consequence the whole band of the filter can be shifted, not only one edge.  \n  \n \n   \n  \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n This work was supported by the Swiss Commission of Technology and Innovation CTI \n(project no. 7925.1). \n \nREFERENCES \n \n1.

Different additive combinations of LiF, ZnF2 and BaF2 were \nspecifically compared in terms of dielectric constant, dielectric loss and Curie temperature (Tc) \nfor the purpose of optimizing dielectric performance. The thick film consisting of 95BaTiO3-\n1.5LiF-1.5ZnF2-2 bismuth borosilicate glass exhibited the best performance, i.e., a dielectric \nconstant of 2,382 and a dissipation factor of 0.021 at Tc of 27\n \n oC at the firing temperature of \n950oC. This result can be regarded as one of the best performance, compared to literature \nreported on embedded capacitors in Cu-PCB applications. No apparent Cu-diffusion was \ndetected across the Cu-thick film-Cu foil structure. \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n \n New high-performance passive components including capacitors and resistors have been \nrequired for successful development of the SOP (system-on-package) technology. There can be \ntwo approaches, thin films versus thick films, to embedded capacitors that are applicable for Cu-\nPCB substrates [1,2]. It has been recognized, particularly, that the thick film technology is more \nviable in terms of cost effectiveness and easy-processing as long as it secures a sufficiently high \ncapacitance density. Since high dielectric constant materials such as ferroelectric BaTiO3 and Pb-\nbased relaxors are required for high capacitance density, the control of Tc is believed to be \ncritical in maximizing dielectric performance at room temperature.  \n \n Several additives having low melting temperatures have been investigated to densify \nsamples at relatively low temperatures below 950oC for the thick film technology utilizing screen \nprinting [3,4]. As one of the solutions to achieve the low temperature densification, low melting \nglasses or fluoride compounds have been combined with high k BaTiO3 materials [5-11]. For \nexample, Haussonne et al. [9] have reported the effect of 1~2 wt% LiF additions on the dielectric \nproperties of BaTiO3 with variable Ba/Ti ratios. Benziada et al. [10] studied the BaTiO3-BaLiF3 \nsystem having a Curie temperature Tc close to 10\n \n oC. \nIn this work, several additive combinations based on Bi-borosilicate glass and fluoride \n \n compounds were selected for improving dielectric performance of BaTiO3-based thick film \ncapacitors, which were specifically designed for Cu-PCB applications. Understanding of the \nadditive effects on the resultant physical and electrical characteristics of thick film capacitors is \nthe main purpose of this work. \n \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1075 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1075-J07-10 \n  \n \n   \n  \nEXPERIMENT \n \n \n Figure 1 shows the fabrication procedure of the BaTiO3-based thick film capacitors on \nCu foils. The thick film pastes were prepared by mixing of BaTiO3 (99%, Aldrich), fluorides and \na bismuth borosilicate glass with ethyl cellulose based organic vehicles. The glass frit was \nobtained by quenching from 950oC and ball-milling for 20h as described previously [12]. The \nfluoride compounds of AlF3 (99%, High purity chemicals), BaF2 (99%, Acros), CaF2 (98%, \nJunsei), LiF (99%, Aldrich), ZnF2 (99%, Aldrich) were used. \n \n \n  \nFigure 1. Fabrication procedure of thick film \ncapacitors based on BaTiO3  with additives and \n \n  \n \n Figure 2. Heating profile for thick film \nfabrication processing. \n \n The pastes were screen printed on Cu foils and dried at 120oC for 10min. The printing/drying \nprocedure was repeated twice. The dried thick films were heat-treated in a specified way as \nrepresented in Figure 2. First, it was soaked at 400oC for 15min in air for binder burn-out and \nthen fired at 950oC for 30min in N2 atmosphere for densification. \n \n Figure 3 shows the thermal behavior of the organic vehicles, which was measured by TG-\nDTA (2000S, MAC Science). A nearly 100% weight loss was observed up to near 360oC and \nthere has been no significant weight loss above 400oC. Therefore, the burn-out condition was \ndetermined as 400oC for 15min. As an additional step, the reduction of Cu foil was conducted \nduring cooling in a N2/H2 atmosphere. Finally, a Cu paste as a top electrode was screen printed \non the thick film and fired at 850oC for 15min in N2 atmosphere. \n \n  \nFigure 3.

Dielectric properties were measured at 1MHz using an impedance \nanalyzer (HP 4194A, Hewlett-Packard) coupled in a temperature-controllable chamber. \n \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n \n Dielectric properties and Curie temperature were sensitive depending on fluoride additive \ncompounds. Table I represents dielectric properties of thick film capacitors having different \nfluoride additives such as AlF3, BaF2, CaF2, ZnF2 and LiF. For comparison, the thick film \ncompositions having an identical amount of each 3wt% fluoride were processed in the same \nexperimental condition. As a result, the thick film samples containing AlF3, BaF2 and CaF2 \npossessed high Tc above 84\n \n oC while only the ZnF2 sample showed a negative Tc of around -26\noC. \n \n Our previous work demonstrated the similar result of the fluoride effect on Tc in the case of bulk \nsamples [12]. According to the previous work, only the ZnF2 case exhibited the negative Tc of -\n16 to -19oC depending on firing between air and N2 atmosphere. It is not sure why the small \ncontent of fluoride can result in such dramatic changes in Tc. The postulation related to the size \nof ionic radius and the subsequent Tc variation may be most recognizable [13]. For example of \nthe LiF case, the octahedron volume of TiO6 in the perovskite structure is slightly smaller than \nthat of LiF6 due to their ionic size, i.e., rTi\n \n 4+ : 0.605Å, rLi\n+ : 0.74Å, rO\n \n 2- : 1.4Å, rF\n- : 1.33Å. The \n \n change in basic volume, induced by the different ionic size, is believed to be associated with the \nionic response to the structural change over the transition temperature. The LiF-containing thick \nfilm having a Tc of near RT(room temperature) showed the highest dielectric constant of 1,375 \nwith a reasonably low dissipation factor of 0.020 at the Curie temperature of 30oC. It is \nnoticeable that the ZnF2 sample also showed an even higher dielectric constant 1,952 with a \ndissipation factor of 0.038 at Tc. \nTable II represents the second series of additive compositions selected from the dielectric results \nof Table I. The thick films are basically based on the combination of LiF and ZnF2, which \nshowed the promising dielectric performance of each case. As an additional possibility, BaF2 \nwas combined with ZnF2. The same contents of 2wt% bismuth borosilicate glass were used for \nthe selected thick films. The LiF/ZnF2 combinations demonstrated very promising potentials as \nan embedded capacitor by showing an unexpectedly high dielectric constant of ~2,210 at 1 MHz, \nparticularly for the composition of 1.5LiF/1.5ZnF2. The dielectric constant seemed to depend on \nthe total amount of LiF/ZnF2 content. For instance, the 0.5LiF/0.5ZnF2 thick film showed a \nlower dielectric constant of ~680 at 1 MHz. \n \n  \nTable I.

Dielectric properties of the thick film capacitors with various additive combinations, fired at \n950oC for 30 min in N2. \n \n  \nThe total content of LiF/ZnF2 must affect the level of densification of the thick films since the \nmelting temperature of LiF and ZnF2 are pretty low as 848\n \n oC and 872oC, respectively. In such \nregard, the 1.5LiF/1.5ZnF2 is believed to be most effective in improving densification at the \nfiring temperature of 950oC, and, subsequently, in generating most promising dielectric \nproperties while keeping Tc to around room temperature. The case of 2.0BaF2/1.0ZnF2 thick \nfilms demonstrated another possibility of controlling Tc by combining positive and negative Tc \nadditives. The sample resulted in a dielectric constant of 1,445 and a dissipation factor of 0.027 \nat Tc of 65\n \n oC. Further optimization of the BaF2/ZnF2 additives may need to be followed for the \nbetter dielectric performance. \n \n Figures 4 and 5 show the temperature dependence of dielectric constant for the selected \nthick films containing LiF/ZnF2 or BaF2/ZnF2. The case of LiF/ZnF2, as shown in Figure 4, \nreveals the broad changes of dielectric constant over the temperature range, which is another \nimportant achievement for the embedded capacitor. On the other hand, the BaF2/ZnF2 case \nshowed steeper changes of dielectric constant over the transition temperature.  \n \n                           \nFigure 4. Temperature dependence of dielectric \nconstant for the (A) 95BaTiO3-1.5LiF-1.5ZnF2-\n2Glass thick film and (B) 92BaTiO3-3.0LiF-\n3.0ZnF2-2Glass thick film. \n \n Figure 5.

The thick film corresponds to the composition containing the \n1.5LiF/1.5ZnF2 additive. The thick film was found well-densified without significant porosity at \nthe temperature. Full densification is generally required for the potential reduction of film \nthickness for higher capacitance density without leading to unwanted high dielectric loss or low \nbreakdown voltage. \n \n  \n \n Additive Composition (wt%) \nDielectric constant \n \n (at 1MHz) \nDissipation factor \n \n (at 1MHz) \nLiF ZnF2 BaF2 Glass \n \n Tc\n \n \n (oC) \nat RT at Tc at RT at Tc \n \n 0.5 0.5 - 2 26 680 711 0.046 0.043 \n1.5 1.5 - 2 27 2,210 2,382 0.036 0.021 \n3 3 - 2 32 1,380 1,491 0.034 0.034 \n- 1 2 2 65 1,176 1,445 0.035 0.027  \n  \n \n   \n  \n \nFigure 6.

Curie temperature was controllable from 118 to -26oC \ndepending on the choice of fluoride compounds. The additive combination of 1.5wt% LiF and \n1.5wt% ZnF2 with 2wt% glass was regarded as the best composition by exhibiting a dielectric \nconstant of 2,382 and a dissipation factor of 0.021 at Tc of 27\n \n oC as a result of 950oC firing in N2. \nThe elemental analysis across the Cu-thick film-Cu foil structure confirmed that there was no \ndetectable diffusion of Cu over the interfaces. \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n We would like to express sincere acknowledgment for the financial support by Korea \nElectronics Technology Institute (KETI) through a research project. \n \n  \n  \n \n   \n REFERENCES \n \n1.

The polyimide \nlocally cured at temperature over 350 ºC for 1 hour was fully cured. There were no significant \ndifferences in the  polyimide thin films between cured in convection ovens and locally cured on \nmicrohotplate. The locally cured polyimide humidity sensor showed a linearity of 0.9995, a \nsensitivity of 0.766pF/%RH, a hysteresis of 0.6%RH, and a time response of 3 s. These results \nshow the possibility of locally-cured polyimide films as high speed, high-sensitivity humidity \nsensors.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n \n Polyimide humidity sensors are widely used in industrial and commercial applications \nsince they offer low power consumption and high sensitivity to humidity [1,2]. In general, \npolyimide films are cured in convection ovens at elevated temperatures (350-400°C) to assure \nadequate mechanical and electrical properties. These high temperatures can change the electrical \nproperties of the devices, especially in the case of CMOS-based sensor because the maximum \ntemperature acceptable for CMOS circuits or other sensors does not match with the curing \ntemperature of polyimide film. If these films were cured on the wafer or sensor chip, locally \nrather than globally, there could be a minimization of effect on the device as well as a lower \nthermal budget for the devices.  \n \n MEMS microhotplates have emerged in recent years as an important tool for the \ntemperature controlled growth of gas sensing materials [3]. Using microhotplates, arrays can \nconveniently be prepared even with a large number of sensors. The most outstanding feature of \nmicrohotplates is the low amount of energy in the range of 5-100 mW required to heat the active \nlayer up to its sensing temperature. In recent years, microhotplates operating at temperatures \nhigher than 500°C have been developed for various applications, such as sensors, infrared \nsources, and microreactors [4]. \n \n In this study, for the first time, a new attempt was made to cure locally polyimide films \nusing MEMS microhotplates. To enhance the sensitivity and speed two different humidity \nsensors (Types A and B) have been fabricated. A high-speed capacitive humidity sensor was \nachieved by introducing a micro-bridge structure created using the front-side etching with XeF2 \ngas and allowing moisture to diffuse into both top and side surfaces of polyimide film.  \n \n  \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1075 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1075-J07-04 \n  \n \n   \n   \n  \nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS \n \n \n Figure 1 shows a polyimide film spin-coated on a backside-etched microhotplate.  The \nmicrohotplate consists of a silicon nitride membrane that has embedded in it a Pt heater and Pt \nRTD (Resistance Temperature Detector) thermometer, which is used to measure the temperature \non the microhotplate. The fabrication process starts with the LPCVD deposition of an 8000 Å \nthick, low-stress silicon nitride layers to be used as a supporting membrane for the devices. For \nmicroheater and RTD a 2000Å/200Å thick Pt/Ta layers are then deposited on the device center \nby lift-off with optical lithography using negative tone photoresist \nLocalized curing of polyimide films \n \n Solutions of the PDMA-ODA polyamic acid were obtained commercially from HD \nMicrosystems. All films were prepared by spin coating the solution onto the microhotplates and \nthen patterned by optical lithography. The pattern area is 1x1 mm2. Two types of curing were \nperformed after spin-coating of polyimide: (i) on-chip curing and (ii) curing of the whole wafer \nin a furnace. The first cures were carried out at 250 ºC for 30 minutes in convection ovens, which \nwere flushed continuously with dry nitrogen, and the temperature of the microheaters was \ncontrolled by external current. The final cures were performed at temperature range between \n250ºC and 400ºC for 1 hour (Figure 1). In order to evaluate the effect of microhotplate cure on \npolyimide films, they were also cured according to standard thermal cure processes as \nrecommended by the manufacturers. Preparation of films for this purpose was identical to that \ndescribed above for films to be locally cured in the microhotplate.  \n \n Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) technique was used to characterize the \nextent of cure (i.e., imide concentration) of the films cured by both microhotplate and \nconventional thermal methods. \n \n \n \n \n                 \n \n \n  \nFigure 1. Localized cure of polyimide film using microhotplate \n \n  \n \n \n 300 ºC 350 ºC \n \n Cured PI films  \n  \n \n   \n   \n fabricated. The patterned heater and RTD were covered with a 5000 Å thick CVD oxide. After \nspin-coating and curing polyimide films, porous Cr film was deposited on some polyimide thin \nfilms and patterned using photolithography to form the upper electrode of the conventional \nhumidity-sensitive capacitors (Figure 2a). The response time of a humidity sensor can be \nenhanced by modifying the shape and dimensions of the polyimide film [5]. To enhance the \nspeed the micro-bridge structure with a lot of holes was created using the front-side etching with \nXeF2 gas, shown in Figure 2(b). \n \n  \n(a) Type A                                (b) Type B \n \n Figure 2 Schematics of two capacitive humidity sensors fabricated on a microhotplate. \n \n \n DISCUSSION  \n \nSpectroscopic analysis of locally cured polyimide films \n \n Figure 3 shows the FTIR spectra for a microhotplate cured polyimide film used to \ncalculate the extent of imidization. Within the accuracy of FTIR, there are no detectable \ndifferences between the films. The 1380 cm-1 peak can be used as an indication of degree of cure \n[6]. This peak is observed when the imide ring closes. The 1500 cm-1 peak, corresponding to the \nC-C stretching vibration of the p-substituted benzene, does not change during cure and can be \nused as an internal reference peak. As the polyimide curing process progresses, the 1380 cm-1 \nband grows in intensity, while the 1500 cm-1 band remains constant. The degree of imidization \ncan be calculated using the following equation. \n \n \n        100\n)cm1500(/)cm1380(\n \n )cm1500(/)cm1380(\n)nimidizatiopercent (\n \n 11\n \n 11\n \n ×= −−\n−−\n \n RR II\n \n II\nP                  (1) \n \n  \nThe reference absorbencies, I(1380cm-1)R and I(1500cm\n \n -1)R are determined from a polyimide \nfilm for which 100% imidization is assumed (standard thermal cure). Therefore I(1380cm-1)R and \nI(1500cm-1)R means the 100% polyimization under full thermal curing treatment. The polyimide \nis fully cured when no amide groups (-CONH) of polyamic acid are left over. Temperature and \ntime were found to be significant with respect to percent imidization. Based on the peak areas of \nthe 1350 and 1500 cm-1 bands, the polyimide locally cured at temperatures over 350°C for 1 hour \nwas fully cured. There were no significant differences in the polyimide thin films between cured \nin convection ovens and locally cured on microhotplate. However, a level of 75% imidization \nwas achieved at 300°C for 1 hour. \n \n \n Fabrication of humidity sensors \n \n As shown in Figure 2, two different humidity sensors (types A and B) have been  \n  \n \n   \n   \n   The capacitance of the devices was measured using a LCR meter at 20 kHz, 1 Vrms in an \nenvironmental chamber. The relative humidity was varied from 25% to 85% at 25 °C. Each \ndevice was exposed to a particular relative humidity and then readings were recorded after 2 h. \nIn order to ensure reproducibility, devices were then removed and exposed to ambient air for at \nleast 1 h before exposure to the next relative humidity. This was repeated four times for each \nfilm to ensure reproducibility.  \n \n \n  \n \n \n Figure 3.  FTIR spectra for locally cured polyimide films. \n \n \n  \nFigure 4 shows a normalized capacitance versus relative humidity for a locally-cured \n \n polyimide humidity sensor. The outputs of the convection oven-cured and the microhotplate-\ncured polyimide humidity sensors varied from 150 to 177 pF and from 190 to 236 pF, \nrespectively. A linear response was achieved in both cases. The locally cured devices showed a \nlinearity of 0.9995, a sensitivity of 0.766pF/%RH, and a hysteresis of 0.6%RH. \n \n Characteristics of humidity sensors \n  \n  \n \n   \n   \n 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n0.99\n \n 1.02\n \n 1.05\n \n 1.08\n \n 1.11\n \n 1.14\n \n 1.17\n \n 1.20\n \n  \n \n  \n \n N\no\n \n rm\nal\n \n iz\ned\n \n  C\nap\n \n ac\nit\n \n an\nce\n \n Relative humidity(%RH)\n \n  \nFigure 4.

This \nmethod open up new possibilities for polyimide thin film fabrication that are not available in \nconventional wafer-scale cure using convection ovens. A localized curing of polyimide film \nprotects components or electronics on the same chip, from excessive heating which now are \noccurring only at the selected microhotplates. These arise from the ability to locally control the \ncuring processing of the polyimide film on that element.  \n \n These results show the possibility of locally-cured polyimide films as high speed, high-\nsensitivity humidity sensors. \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n \n This work was supported by grant No. K20601000002-07E0100-00210 from Korea \nFoundation for International Cooperation of Science ＆ Technology. \n \nREFERENCES \n \n1.

Currently, we are developing a 1024x1024 pixel \nsimultaneous pixel co-registered dualband QWIP FPA. In addition, epitaxially grown self-\nassembled InAs/InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) are exploited for the development of large-\nformat FPAs. The Dot-in-a-Well (DWELL) structures were experimentally shown to absorb both \n45o and normal incident light, therefore a reflection grating structure was used to enhance the \nquantum efficiency. The devices exhibit peak responsivity out to 8.1 microns, with peak \ndetectivity reaching ~ 1 x 1010 Jones at 77 K.  The devices were fabricated into the first LWIR \n640x512 pixel QDIP FPA, which has produced excellent infrared imagery with the NETD of 40 \nmK at 60K operating temperature.  \n \n  \n \n INTRODUCTION \n \n \n There are many applications that require mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) and long-\nwavelength infrared (LWIR) dualband focal plane arrays (FPAs). For example, a dualband FPA \ncamera would provide the absolute temperature of a target with unknown emissivity, which is \nextremely important to the process of identifying a temperature difference between missile \ntargets, warheads, and decoys.  Dualband infrared FPAs can also play many important roles in \nEarth and planetary remote sensing, astronomy, etc. Furthermore, monolithically integrated pixel \ncollocated simultaneously readable dualband FPAs eliminate the beam splitters, filters, moving \nfilter wheels, and rigorous optical alignment requirements imposed on dualband systems based \non two separate single-band FPAs or a broadband FPA system with filters. Dualband FPAs also \nreduce the mass, volume, and power requirements of dualband systems. Due to the inherent \nproperties such as narrow-band response, wavelength tailorability, and stability (i.e., low 1/f \nnoise) associated with GaAs based QWIPs [1-6], it is an ideal candidate for large format \ndualband infrared FPAs.  \n \n  \n \n 320X256 PIXEL DUALBAND FOCAL PLANE ARRAY \n \n \n As shown in figure 1, our dualband FPA is based on two different types of (i.e., MWIR \nand LWIR) QWIP devices separated by a 0.5 micron thick, heavily doped, n-type GaAs layer. \nThe device structures of the MWIR and LWIR devices are very similar to the MWIR and LWIR \nThe MWIR device described here, each period of the multi-quantum-well (MQW) structure \nconsists of coupled quantum wells of 40 Å containing 10 Å GaAs, 20 Å In0.3Ga0.7As, and 10 Å \nGaAs layers  (doped n = 1x1018 cm\u20133) and a 40 Å undoped barrier of Al0.3Ga0.7As between \ncoupled quantum wells, and a 400 Å thick undoped barrier of Al0.3Ga0.7As. Each period of the \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1076 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1076-K03-02 \n  \n \n   \n LWIR MQW structure consists of quantum wells of 40 Å and a 600 Å barrier of Al0.27Ga0.73As. \nStacking many identical periods (typically 50) together increases photon absorption. Both device \nstructures and heavily doped contact layers were grown in-situ during a single growth run using \nmolecular beam epitaxy. It is worth noting that the photosensitive MQW region of each QWIP \ndevice is transparent at other wavelengths, which is an important advantage over conventional \ninterband detectors. This spectral transparency makes QWIPs ideally suited for dualband FPAs \nwith negligible spectral cross-talk. As shown in figure 1, the carriers emitted from each MQW \nregion are collected separately using three contacts. The middle contact layer is used as the \ndetector common. The electrical connections to the detector common, and the LWIR pixel \nconnection, are brought to the top of each pixel using via connections.  \n \n Light coupling to a pixel collocated dualband QWIP device is a challenge since each \ndevice has only a single top surface area. We have developed two different optical coupling  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n Figure 1. 3-D view of dualband QWIP device structure showing via connects for independent \naccess of MWIR and LWIR devices. \n \n  \n \n techniques. The first technique uses a dual period Lamar grating structure. The second technique \nuses the multiple diffraction orders. In this light coupling technique, we have used a 2-D grating \nwith single pitch. The first diffraction orders (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), and (0,-1) couple infrared \nradiation into LWIR pixels, and the second diffraction orders (1,1), (-1,1), (1,-1), and (-1,-1) \ncouple infrared radiation into MWIR pixels. The spectral responsivity of dualband QWIP is \nshown in figure 2. 2-D periodic grating structures were designed to couple the 4-5 and 8-9 µm \nradiation into the detector pixels. The top 0.7 µm thick GaAs cap layer was used to fabricate the \nlight coupling 2-D periodic grating. The 2-D grating reflectors on top of the detectors were then \ncovered with Au/Ge and Au for Ohmic contact and reflection. \n \n   \n  \n \n   \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n Figure 2. Responsivity of the dualband QWIP device as a function of wavelength. \n \n \n After the 2-D grating array was defined by  photolithography and dry etching, the MWIR \ndetector pixels of the 320x256 pixel FPAs, and the via hole to access the detector common, were \nfabricated by dry etching through the photosensitive GaAs/InyGa1-yAs/AlxGa1-xAs MQW layers \ninto the 0.5 µm thick doped GaAs intermediate contact layer.  Then LWIR pixels and  via holes \nto access the LWIR pixels of FPAs were fabricated. A thick insulation layer was deposited and \ncontact windows were opened at the bottom of each via hole and on the top surface. Ohmic \ncontact metal was evaporated and unwanted metal was removed using a metal lift-off process. \nThe pitch of the FPA is 40 µm and the actual MWIR and LWIR pixel sizes are 38x38 µm2. Forty \neight FPAs were processed on a four-inch GaAs wafer. Indium bumps were then evaporated on \ntop of the detectors for silicon read out integrated circuit (ROIC) hybridization. Several dualband \nFPAs were chosen and hybridized (via an indium bump-bonding process) to a 320x256 pixel \nCMOS read out integrated circuit.  A 320x256 pixel co-registered simultaneously readable \ndualband QWIP FPA hybrid was mounted onto a 5 W integral Sterling closed-cycle cooler \nassembly to demonstrate a portable MWIR:LWIR dualband QWIP camera. The digital \nacquisition resolution of the camera is 14-bits, which determines the instantaneous dynamic \nrange of the camera (i.e., 16,384). However, the dynamic range of QWIP is 85 Decibels. Video \nimages were taken at a frame rate of 30 Hz at temperatures as high as T = 68 K, using two ROIC \ncapacitors having charge capacities of 21x10E6 and 87x10E6 electrons for the MWIR and LWIR \nbands respectively.  Figure 3 shows an image taken with the 320x256 pixel co-registered \nsimultaneously readable MWIR:LWIR dualband QWIP camera.  As expected (due to \nbackground limited performance [BLIP]), the estimated and experimentally obtained the NEΔT \nvalues of the LWIR detectors do not change significantly at temperatures below 65 K.  The \nestimated NEΔT of MWIR and LWIR detectors at 65 K are 22 and 24 mK, respectively. These \nestimated NEΔT values based on the test detector data agree reasonably well with the \nexperimentally obtained values. The experimentally measured NEΔT values are shown in the \nfigure 4 (a) and (b). The experimentally measured NEΔT values are slightly higher than the \nestimated NEΔT value based on the results of single element test detector data. This degradation \nin signal-to-noise ratio is attributed to the inefficient light coupling of the dual feature lamalar \ngrating coupler, an unoptimized ROIC, and the significant amount of 1/f noise in the FPA \ncharacterization equipment.   \n \n    \n  \n \n   \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n Figure 3. An image taken with the 320x256 pixel co-registered simultaneously readable \nMWIR:LWIR dualband QWIP camera. The person in this image is holding a cigarette lighter. \nThe cigarette lighter produced lots of hot CO2 gas. So, the flame in the MWIR image looks \nbroader due to re- emission of the infrared signal in 4.1-4.3 microns band by the heated CO2 gas \nproduced by the cigarette lighter. Whereas, the heated CO2 gas doesn\u2019t have any emission line in \nthe LWIR (8-9 microns) band. Thus, the LWIR image shows only thermal signatures of the \nflame. The hot cigarette lighter flame produced a lot of MWIR signal, so it reflects off from the \nlens and face. \n \n \n As we have mentioned earlier, QWIP is an ideal detector for the fabrication of pixel co-\nregistered simultaneously readable dualband infrared focal plane arrays, because, QWIP absorbs \ninfrared radiation only in a narrow spectral band which is designed to do so, and the transparent \noutside of that absorption (i.e., detection) band.. Thus it provides zero spectral cross-talk when \ntwo spectral bands are a few microns apart. The initial GaAs substrate of these dualband FPAs \nare completely removed leaving only a 50 nm thick GaAs membrane. Thus, these dualband \nQWIP FPAs are not vulnerable to FPA delamination and indium bump breakage during thermal \nrecycling process, and has no pixel-to-pixel optical cross-talk. Inspired from this success, now \nwe are developing a megapixel (1024x1024 pixel) dualband QWIP FPA sensitive in MWIR and \nLWIR spectral bands.  \n \n \n 14000\n \n 12000\n \n 10000\n \n 8000\n \n 6000\n \n 4000\n \n 2000\n \n 0\n \n Nu\nm\n \n be\nr o\n \n f P\nixe\n \n ls\n \n 0 50 100 150 200\nNEΔT (mK)\n \n 14000\n \n 12000\n \n 10000\n \n 8000\n \n 6000\n \n 4000\n \n 2000\n \n 0\n \n N\num\n \n be\nr o\n \n f P\nixe\n \n ls\n \n 0 100 200 300\nNEΔT (mK)\n \n (a) (b)\n \n  \n \n  \n \n Figure 4.

The experimentally measured NEΔT of MWIR  and LWIR detectors at 65 K \nare 28 and 38 mK, respectively.    \n  \n \n   \n   \n DEVELOPMENT OF 1024X1024 PIXEL MWIR AND LWIR DUALBAND QWIP FPA \n \n \n Most infrared FPAs consist of non-silicon detector arrays and silicon ROICs. Silicon \nROICs are usually fabricated on large area (i.e., 8 \u2013 12-inch dia.) wafers. In the process of large \nformat IR FPA development, it is necessary to select an IR detector technology based on large \narea wafers.  QWIP FPA technology is entirely based on the highly stable III-V material system \nthat can be easily processed with the more mature fabrication technologies.  \n \n The state-of-the-art array fabrication processes are based on either mask aligners or \nreticle-based steppers. A typical reticle field is 22x22 mm2. The pixel pitch of the largest 1Kx1K \narray fits in to a reticle field that is 18 µm. The pixel pitch of the 1Kx1K pixel dualband QWIP \nFPA is 30 μm. Thus, a 30 μm pixel pitch 1Kx1K array cannot be fabricated using conventional \nreticle stepping or mask aligning methods. As shown in figure 5, a large detector array can be \nfabricated using \u201cStitching\u201d. Stitching is a new photolithographic technique that can be used to \nfabricate detector arrays larger than the reticle field of photolithographic steppers. We have used \nthe stitching technique to fabricate 1Kx1K arrays that can be easily extended into the fabrication \nof 2Kx2K and 4Kx4K detector arrays. In this case, the detector array layout is divided into \nsmaller portion \u201ctiles\u201d, which together fit in the reticle field. Array characteristics or repeated \nsections of the detector array are exploited to minimize the required reticle area by using \nmultiple exposures of smaller blocks to create a large array. Each detector array is then \nphotocomposed on the wafer by multiple exposures of detector array sections at appropriate \nlocations on the wafer.  Single sections of the detector array are exposed at one time, as the \noptical system allows shuttering, or selectively exposing only a desired section of the reticle. \nFigure 5 depicts photocomposition of the detector array on a wafer by stitching. It should be \nnoted that stitching creates a truly seamless detector array, as opposed to an assembly of closely \nbutted pieces.   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n Figure 5. This figure shows the photocomposition of a detector array die using array stitching \nbased on a photolithographic stepper. \n \n  \n \n After the 2-D grating array was defined by  stepper based photolithography and dry \netching, the MWIR detector pixels of the 1024x1024 pixel detector arrays, and the via hole to \naccess the detector common, were fabricated by dry etching through the photosensitive \nGaAs/InyGa1-yAs/AlxGa1-xAs MQW layers into the 0.5 µm thick doped GaAs intermediate  \n  \n \n   \n contact layer.  Then LWIR pixels and via holes to access the LWIR pixels of FPAs were \nfabricated. A thick insulation layer was deposited and contact windows were opened at the \nbottom of each via hole and on the top surface. Ohmic contact metal was evaporated and \nunwanted metal was removed using a metal lift-off process. The pitch of the FPA is 40 µm and \nthe actual MWIR and LWIR pixel sizes are 28x28 µm2. Five detector arrays were processed on a \nfour-inch GaAs wafer. Indium bumps were then evaporated on top of the detectors for  \nhybridization with ROICs. Several dualband detector arrays were chosen and hybridized (via an \nindium bump-bonding process) to grade B (i.e., some dead columns) 1024x1024 pixel silicon \nROICs.  \n \n Array thinning or the substrate removal process is critical to the success and durability of \nlarge format cryogenic FPAs. Thus, after the detector array and ROIC hybridization process via \nindium bumps, the gaps between FPA detectors and the ROIC are backfilled with epoxy. This \nepoxy backfilling provides the necessary mechanical strength to the detector array and ROIC \nhybrid prior to the thinning process. During the first step of the thinning process, an \napproximately 630 µm thick GaAs layer was removed using diamond point turning. Then \nBromine-Methanol chemical polishing was used to remove another approximately 100 µm thick \nGaAs layer. This step is very important because it removes all scratch marks left on the substrate \ndue to abrasive polishing. Otherwise these scratch marks will be enhanced and propagated in to \nthe final step via preferential etching. Then, wet chemical etchant was used to reduce the \nsubstrate thickness to several microns and then SF6:BCl3 selective dry etchant was used as the \nfinal etch. This final etching completely removed the remaining GaAs substrate. At this point the \nremaining GaAs/AlGaAs material contains only the QWIP pixels and a very thin membrane \n(~500Å). The thermal mass of this membrane is insignificant compared to the rest of the hybrid. \nThis allows it to adapt to the thermal expansion and contraction coefficients of the silicon ROIC \nand completely eliminates the thermal mis-match problem between the silicon based readout and \nthe GaAs based detector array. This basically allows QWIP FPAs to go through an unlimited \nnumber of temperature recycles without any indium bump breakage and array delamination. \nFurthermore, this substrate removal process provides two additional advantages for QWIP FPAs: \nthose are the complete elimination of pixel-to-pixel optical cross-talk and a significant (a factor \nof two with 2-D periodic gratings) enhancement in optical coupling of infrared radiation into \nQWIP pixels. Figure 6 shows a megapixel dualband QWIP FPA mounted on a 124 pin LCC.  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n Figure 6. Picture of a 1024x1024 pixel silicon ROIC mounted on a 100-pin lead less chip\n \n \n  \n \n Primary goals of these test hybrids were to test their mechanical stability, sub-strate \nremoval, and pixel connectivity. A test (i.e., used grade B RIC) MWIR:LWIR pixel co-registered \nsimultaneously readable dualband QWIP FPA has been mounted on to the cold finger of a pour \n \n carrier (LLC). \n  \n \n   \n fill dewar, cooled by liquid nitrogen and the two bands (i.e., MWIR and LWIR) were \nindependently biased. Some imagery was performed at temperature 68 K. An image is shown in \nfigure 7.  The left panel shows a MWIR image and right panel shows a LWIR image of a person \nholding a hair dryer. The poor image quality of the MWIR image is due to poor pixel \nconnectivity (~ 60%), which attributes to the breakage of metal connectors in via holes. Figure 8 \nshows some SEM pictures of the via connects, which connects the bottom of MWIR pixels to the \nbottom detector common under the LWIR pixels. The left panel shows the connectivity of this \nvia metal connectors, however, the right panel shows some broken metal connectors. This \nconfirms the poor pixel operability of MWIR is due to via metal breakage. These metal layers \nwere deposited via e-beam metal evaporation.  We think this metal breakage issue can be solved \nwith sputtering based metal deposition due to its conformal coverage. During the next wafer run \nwe should be able to improve the pixel operability and performance by using sputter deposition \nof via connect metal and grade A ROICs. \n \n  \n \n  \n \n Figure 7.

Scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) of via holes and metal bridges which connect  \nthe MWIR detector commons and LWIR detector common at the bottom of both pixels. The left \npanel shows good connectivity, whereas right panel shows disconnected metal bridges. \n  \n  \n \n   \n The main benefit in using the QD approach stems from 3D quantum confinement, which \n(1) enables normal incidence absorption by modifying the optical transition selection rule, and, \n(2) increases the photo-excited carrier lifetime by reducing optical phonon scattering via the \n\u201cphonon bottleneck\u201d mechanism [7-10]. However, QDs also have some drawbacks that need to \nbe addressed.   In a typical detector structure, QD densities are low (compared to the number of \ndopants in the active regions of QWIPs); so while individual QDs are efficient absorbers, typical \nQD densities are not high enough to achieve high quantum efficiency. Thus, while QD based \ninfrared detectors have clearly demonstrated normal incidence absorption, and, in some \ninstances, higher operating temperature as well, they are still lacking in quantum efficiency and \nresponsivity.   \n \n The first-generation QDIPs are high-gain, low-quantum-efficiency devices.  Improving \nquantum efficiency is a key to achieving a competitive QD-based FPA technology.  This can be \naccomplished by increasing the QD density, or by enhancing the infrared absorption in the QD-\ncontaining material.  There are various versions of QDIPs, based on different materials and \ndesigns.  After considering all types of competing QD-based approaches, we feel that one of the \nmost promising options for LWIR FPAs is the use of the Dot-in-a-well (DWELL) QDIP. Our \nspecific implementation uses InAs and InGaAs QDs embedded in GaAs/AlGaAs multi-quantum \nwell structures, as illustrated in figure 9. This material system can sustain a large number of QD \nstacks without suffering material degradation, thereby allowing high dot density. The host \nGaAs/AlGaAs multi-quantum well structures are highly compatible with the mature FPA \nfabrication process that we use routinely to make QWIP FPAs; in that sense, this system may be \nviewed as simply a QWIP with embedded InAs QDs. Similar to other intersubband detectors, \nDWELLs operate by the photoexcitation of electrons between energy levels in the potential well \ncreated by the nano-scale QD in a well structure.  The right panel of figure 9 shows that, under \nan applied bias voltage, these photo-excited carriers can escape from the potential wells and be \ncollected as photocurrent. The wavelengths of the spectral peaks (λp) are determined by the \nenergy difference between quantized states in the DWELL.  The hybrid quantum-dot/quantum-\nwell, or dot-in-a-well (DWELL), device offers two advantages: (1) challenges in the wavelength \ntuning through dot-size control can be compensated in part by engineering the quantum well \nsizes, which can be controlled precisely; (2) quantum wells can trap electrons and aid in carrier \ncapture by QDs, thereby facilitating ground state refilling.   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  Figure 9.  Illustration of the Dot-in-a-Well (DWELL) device.  The top left panel shows the \npotential profile, with three pyramid shaped dots embedded in the quantum well.  The bottom left \npanel displays a calculated DWELL ground state wave function, represented by a white \ntranslucent equal-probability isosurface, localized by a pyramidal quantum dot.  The right panel \nillustrates the operation of a DWELL infrared detector. \n \n  \n \n THE DOT-IN-THE-WELL INFRARED PHOTODETECTOR   \n  \n \n   \n   \n MATERIAL GROWTH AND DEVICE FABRICATION \n \n \n All DWELL-QDIP wafers were grown on semi-insulating 4\u201d GaAs substrates using a \nVeeco Gen-III MBE Reactor. After evaluating the material quality, selected wafers were \nprocessed into test detector mesas.  After the 200 µm x 200 µm square mesas are defined by \nlithography, the DWELL-QDIP test detectors were fabricated by standard wet and dry chemical \netching through the stack of photosensitive layers into the doped GaAs bottom contact layer. The \ntop contact of the detectors were covered with Au/Ge and Au for an Ohmic contact which also \nserves as a reflector for light incident through the bottom contact, allowing two passes through \nthe active layers. Initial QDIP characterization of discrete devices included measurements of the \nroom-temperature absorption spectra, side and normal incident responsivity spectra, dark current, \nand noise.  These detectors were tested in a cryogenically cooled test bed using a calibrated \nblackbody source to evaluate responsivity of the detector over the relevant range of operating \ntemperatures and bias voltages.  \n \n  \n \n ELECTRICAL AND OPTICAL CHARACTERIZATION \n \n \n During this development we have measured the normal and 45-degree incidence responsivity of \nDWELL QDIP samples.  A typical set of results is shown in figure 10. As hoped, the normal \nincidence responsivity (relative to the 45-degree responsivity) is much stronger (almost 1 order \nof magnitude) than that found in a typical QWIP.  At the same time, we also find that the 45-\ndegree incidence responsivity is 4 to 5 times stronger than the normal incidence responsivity. \nThis implies that at these wavelengths, the DWELL QWIPs not only have good absorption for \nnormal incidence (x,y-polarized; with z being the normal incidence direction) light, it also \nabsorbs inclined (or side) incidence (z-polarized) light even more strongly. This knowledge has \nprompted an important design modification, as we now wish to take advantage of the DWELL \nQDIP\u2019s ability to absorb both normal and inclined incidence light in order to maximize quantum \nefficiency.  As in QWIPs, normal incidence light can be coupled to the z-polarization light \nabsorption mechanism in DWELL QDIPs by using a reflection grating. Due to our extensive \nexperience in designing and fabricating FPA-compatible integrated optical structures for QWIPs, \nwe were in an excellent position to implement the grating reflector enhanced QDIP. Figure 11 \nshows our preliminary experimental results on grating enhancement. Normal incidence \nresponsivity was measured for a DWELL QDIP sample, fabricated both with and without a \nreflection grating. The device with the reflection grating shows approximately three times larger \nnormal incident responsivity than the one without, clearly indicating the promise of this \napproach.  \n  \n  \n \n   \n   \n  \n \n Figure 10.

Selected detector \nhybrids were mounted and wire-bonded to a leadless chip carrier (LCC). A specially designed \ndewar was used to characterize the FPA functionality using a general-purpose electronic system \nfrom SE-IR Incorporated. The SE-IR system was programmed to generate complex timing \npatterns, and was reconfigured to handle development grade FPAs. The best performance was \ndetermined by optimizing operating-parameters for each FPA. The FPAs were characterized for \npixel responsivity, quantum efficiency, noise, D*, NEΔT, pixel operability, before and after \ncorrection uniformity, and pixel operability. The spectral responsivity of the FPA was determined \nusing a separate single mesa processed with the FPA. NEΔT as a function of bias and integration \ntime at a fixed operating temperature was used as a metric for parameter optimization.  \nCharge injection efficiency can be obtained from )Rg/(RgE DmDminj += 1 , where gm is the trans-\nconductance of the MOSFET and is given by gm = eIDet/kT.  The differential resistance RDet of \nthe 23x23 μm2 pixels at -350 mV bias is 5.5x1010 Ohms at T = 60 K and detector capacitance \nCDet is 1.4x10\n \n -14\n F.  The detector total current is IDet = 17 pA under the same operating conditions. \n \n However, the dynamic resistance of the detector and ROIC is given by RD.CROIC = tint, where \nCROIC is the capacitance of the ROIC integration capacitor and tint is the integration time. We \nhave integrated the signal for 20 ms. The input capacitance of ISC 9803 ROIC is 350 fF, which \nyields RD of 5.7x1010 Ohms. According to the equation above, the charge injection efficiency \nEinj= 99.65% at a frame rate of 50 Hz. The FPA was back-illuminated through the flat thinned \nsubstrate membrane (thickness ≈ 1000 Å).  This initial array gave very good images with >99% \nof the pixels working, demonstrating the high yield of GaAs technology. The operability was \ndefined as the percentage of pixels having NEΔT within 2σ at 300 K background with f/2 optics \nand in this case operability happens to be equal to the pixel yield. Figure 14 shows the \nexperimentally measured NE∆T histogram of the FPA at an operating temperature of T = 60 K, \nbias VB = -350 mV at 300 K background with f/2 optics. The mean NEΔT value is 40 mK.

    {"values":"Recently, various nanoscale materials, devices, and systems with remarkable properties have been developed, with numerous unique applications in chem.-bio sensors, nanophotonics, and nanobiotechnology. This presentation covers satellite and aerial remote sensing science and methodologies employing nanotechnology based advanced sensor systems to improve performance, resolutions, and security. Increased demand on monitoring, surveillance due to global war on terrorism, weather prediction, and environmental pollution detection and monitoring have necessitated geospatial sensing with high accuracy, speed, and authenticity. Plasmonic interactions on the nanoscale and nanophotonics have produced new phenomena and technologies surpassing the realms of possibilities with conventional photonics and electronics. These new technologies could include high spatial resolution near-field imaging, high efficiency information processing and transferring, high capacity optical data storage, flexible- and high contrast displays, and precise detection, control and manipulation of nanoscale devices and integrated systems. Elements utilizing refractive or diffractive surfaces have found applications in novel sub-wavelength nanostructures satellites. The nanophotonics structures coupled with lightweight structures and advanced nanotechnology based sensors have resulted in launching of nano-satellites by several countries. The use of nanophotonics in space through the combination of micro, nano, integrated and fibre-optic technologies is to reduce susceptibility of the system to EMI, reduction in the weight of the signal cables (< 1/20 of electrical), higher information transmission capacity (GHz), reduced weight and volume, opto-isolation of critical spacecraft subsystems, high speed optical processing of RF and microwave signals, low propagation loss, and enhanced security encryption capabilities. Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) based field emission electron gun (FEG) employ low voltage for emission and are actively researched as cold cathode microwave generation devices. CNTs based composites provide light-weight and compact platform with mechanical and thermal robustness. Such satellite system can be placed in low Earth orbit (LEO) to medium Earth orbit (MEO) as multi-sensor satellite imagers with panchromatic, multi-spectral, area and hyper spectral sensors on a single focal plane array (FPA), to achieve medium to high resolution (2.5m to 15m) spatial sampling, wide swaths (up to 45km) and noise equivalent reflectance (NER) values of less than 0.5%. An evaluation of security risks, vulnerability, and strategies is presented for communications technologies used in gathering, processing, storing, and disseminating global environmental micro and nano sensors and satellite data."    },

This presentation covers satellite and aerial remote sensing science and methodologies employing nanotechnology based advanced sensor systems to improve performance, resolutions, and security. Increased demand on monitoring, surveillance due to global war on terrorism, weather prediction, and environmental pollution detection and monitoring have necessitated geospatial sensing with high accuracy, speed, and authenticity. Plasmonic interactions on the nanoscale and nanophotonics have produced new phenomena and technologies surpassing the realms of possibilities with conventional photonics and electronics. These new technologies could include high spatial resolution near-field imaging, high efficiency information processing and transferring, high capacity optical data storage, flexible- and high contrast displays, and precise detection, control and manipulation of nanoscale devices and integrated systems. Elements utilizing refractive or diffractive surfaces have found applications in novel sub-wavelength nanostructures satellites. The nanophotonics structures coupled with lightweight structures and advanced nanotechnology based sensors have resulted in launching of nano-satellites by several countries. The use of nanophotonics in space through the combination of micro, nano, integrated and fibre-optic technologies is to reduce susceptibility of the system to EMI, reduction in the weight of the signal cables (< 1/20 of electrical), higher information transmission capacity (GHz), reduced weight and volume, opto-isolation of critical spacecraft subsystems, high speed optical processing of RF and microwave signals, low propagation loss, and enhanced security encryption capabilities. Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) based field emission electron gun (FEG) employ low voltage for emission and are actively researched as cold cathode microwave generation devices. CNTs based composites provide light-weight and compact platform with mechanical and thermal robustness. Such satellite system can be placed in low Earth orbit (LEO) to medium Earth orbit (MEO) as multi-sensor satellite imagers with panchromatic, multi-spectral, area and hyper spectral sensors on a single focal plane array (FPA), to achieve medium to high resolution (2.5m to 15m) spatial sampling, wide swaths (up to 45km) and noise equivalent reflectance (NER) values of less than 0.5%. An evaluation of security risks, vulnerability, and strategies is presented for communications technologies used in gathering, processing, storing, and disseminating global environmental micro and nano sensors and satellite data. \n (Received May 11 2008) \n (Accepted May 23 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t nanostructure;  \n\t sensor;  \n\t electron-phonon interactions \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t \t  How

,"description":"Recently, various nanoscale materials, devices, and systems with remarkable properties have been developed, with numerous unique applications in chem.-bio sensors, nanophotonics, and nanobiotechnology. This presentation covers satellite and aerial remote sensing science and methodologies employing nanotechnology based advanced sensor systems to improve performance, resolutions, and security. Increased demand on monitoring, surveillance due to global war on terrorism, weather prediction, and environmental pollution detection and monitoring have necessitated geospatial sensing with high accuracy, speed, and authenticity. Plasmonic interactions on the nanoscale and nanophotonics have produced new phenomena and technologies surpassing the realms of possibilities with conventional photonics and electronics. These new technologies could include high spatial resolution near-field imaging, high efficiency information processing and transferring, high capacity optical data storage, flexible- and high contrast displays, and precise detection, control and manipulation of nanoscale devices and integrated systems. Elements utilizing refractive or diffractive surfaces have found applications in novel sub-wavelength nanostructures satellites. The nanophotonics structures coupled with lightweight structures and advanced nanotechnology based sensors have resulted in launching of nano-satellites by several countries. The use of nanophotonics in space through the combination of micro, nano, integrated and fibre-optic technologies is to reduce susceptibility of the system to EMI, reduction in the weight of the signal cables (< 1/20 of electrical), higher information transmission capacity (GHz), reduced weight and volume, opto-isolation of critical spacecraft subsystems, high speed optical processing of RF and microwave signals, low propagation loss, and enhanced security encryption capabilities. Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) based field emission electron gun (FEG) employ low voltage for emission and are actively researched as cold cathode microwave generation devices. CNTs based composites provide light-weight and compact platform with mechanical and thermal robustness. Such satellite system can be placed in low Earth orbit (LEO) to medium Earth orbit (MEO) as multi-sensor satellite imagers with panchromatic, multi-spectral, area and hyper spectral sensors on a single focal plane array (FPA), to achieve medium to high resolution (2.5m to 15m) spatial sampling, wide swaths (up to 45km) and noise equivalent reflectance (NER) values of less than 0.5%. An evaluation of security risks, vulnerability, and strategies is presented for communications technologies used in gathering, processing, storing, and disseminating global environmental micro and nano sensors and satellite data.","coins":   [

High-efficiency yellow-orange emission is then achieved by intra-cavity frequency doubling. Over 5 W of CW output power in the 585-589 nm spectral regions is achieved. This compact low-cost high-power yellow-orange laser provides an innovative alternative for sodium guidestar lasers or other medical / communication applications. \n (Received June 25 2008) \n

,"description":"We demonstrate a highly strained InGaAs/GaAs VECSEL operating at 1173 nm with more than 8.5 W output power and tunable over 40 nm. High-efficiency yellow-orange emission is then achieved by intra-cavity frequency doubling. Over 5 W of CW output power in the 585-589 nm spectral regions is achieved. This compact low-cost high-power yellow-orange laser provides an innovative alternative for sodium guidestar lasers or other medical / communication applications.","coins":   [

    {"values":"An all fiber linear frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) coherent laser radar system is under development with a goal to aide NASA's new Space Exploration initiative for manned and robotic missions to the Moon and Mars. Linear FMCW lidar has the capability of high resolution range measurements, and when configured into a multi-channel receiver system it has the capability of obtaining high precision vector velocity measurements. Precision range and vector velocity data are beneficial to navigating planetary landing pods to the pre-selected site and achieving autonomous, safe soft-landing. This paper discusses the design of a second generation prototype system under development at NASA Langley Research Center and presents preliminary performance data obtained from field experiments."    },

Linear FMCW lidar has the capability of high resolution range measurements, and when configured into a multi-channel receiver system it has the capability of obtaining high precision vector velocity measurements. Precision range and vector velocity data are beneficial to navigating planetary landing pods to the pre-selected site and achieving autonomous, safe soft-landing. This paper discusses the design of a second generation prototype system under development at NASA Langley Research Center and presents preliminary performance data obtained from field experiments. \n

,"description":"An all fiber linear frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) coherent laser radar system is under development with a goal to aide NASA's new Space Exploration initiative for manned and robotic missions to the Moon and Mars. Linear FMCW lidar has the capability of high resolution range measurements, and when configured into a multi-channel receiver system it has the capability of obtaining high precision vector velocity measurements. Precision range and vector velocity data are beneficial to navigating planetary landing pods to the pre-selected site and achieving autonomous, safe soft-landing. This paper discusses the design of a second generation prototype system under development at NASA Langley Research Center and presents preliminary performance data obtained from field experiments.","coins":   [

University Blvd., Tucson, AZ, 85750, United States \n ABSTRACT \n  \n Combining novel highly-doped phosphate glasses and advanced fiber drawing techniques, we fabricated and tested single-frequency fiber lasers that generate powers of more than 2-W. We demonstrate enhanced performance employing active photonic crystal fiber compared to more conventional devices that are based on large core step-index fiber. \n Through the integration of phosphate glass fiber gratings and highly-doped active phosphate glass fiber, we improve on optical, thermal, and mechanical behavior of our compact fiber lasers. Powerful and widely tunable phosphate glass distributed fiber lasers are presented and the possibility of cascading several grating structure for multiple wavelength generation is demonstrated. We also present results on phase-locking and coherently combining the output of up to 37 fiber cores into a single, near-Gaussian laser beam. To achieve exclusive oscillation of the fundamental in-phase supermode, several all-fiber laser cavities have been designed, numerically analyzed, fabricated, and tested. We will report on a 10-cm long monolithic all-fiber laser that emits more than 12-W of optical power and is based on combining the output of 19 active cores. All the cores are integrated within the same cladding and arranged in a two-dimensional isometric array. \n (Received May 20 2008) \n (Accepted May 21 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t laser;  \n\t fiber;  \n\t microstructure \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t \t  How to Cite This Article \n\t\t\t\t \n\t  Link to This Abstract \n\t\t \n\t  Blog This Article \n\t\t \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCopy and paste this link  Highlight all \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\thttp://dx.doi.org/10.1557/PROC-1076-K01-02\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tCitation is provided in standard text and BibTeX formats below.\n\t\t\t\t\t Highlight all \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBibTeX Format\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t@inproceedings{OPL:7990098,\nauthor = {Schulzgen,Axel and Li,Li and Zhu,Xiushan and Suzuki,Shigeru and Temyanko,Valery L. and Albert,Jacques and Peyghambarian,Nasser},\ntitle = {Microstructured Soft Glass Fibers for Advanced Fiber Lasers},\nbooktitle = {Symposium K \u2013 Materials and Devices for Laser Remote Sensing and Optical Communication},\nseries = {MRS Proceedings},\nvolume = {1076},\nyear = {2008},\ndoi = {10.1557/PROC-1076-K01-02},\nURL = {http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1946427400031110},\n}\n\n\t\t\t\tClick  here  for full citation export options.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBlog This Article\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\tBlog This Article\n\t\t\t\t\t:\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t Highlight all \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div style=\"background: #FFFFFF; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; padding: 0 10px 0 0; text-align: left; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 1em;\"><div style=\"font-size: 11px; padding: 0px 0px 10px 0px; font-weight:bold; color: #045989;\">Microstructured Soft Glass Fibers for Advanced Fiber Lasers<\/div><div style=\"font-size: 11px;\"><b>Axel Schulzgen,Li Li,Xiushan Zhu,Shigeru Suzuki,Valery L.

It will determine the wind velocity component normal to the satellite velocity vector. The instrument is a direct detection Doppler Lidar operating in the UV, which will be the first of its kind in space. \n ALADIN is now in its final construction stage: the integration of the Flight Model is on-going. Most of the subsystems have been integrated; the payload performance and qualification test campaign will commence. \n This paper describes the ALADIN the development status and the results obtained at this stage. This regards the receiver performance, the telescope development and the challenges of the laser. \n The paper will also provide insights on the ATLID instrument design which is the backscatter lidar for the EarthCARE mission. This lidar program is starting its detailed design phase. \n The ALADIN and ATLID instruments are developed by EADS Astrium Satellites for the European Space Agency. \n (Received May 16 2008) \n

By putting a two dimensional photonic crystal distributed feedback \n(PCDFB) layer evanescently coupled to the main optical mode, both longitudinal and lateral \nbeam coherence can be greatly enhanced, which makes single mode operation possible for broad \narea devices. For PCDFB laser performance, the linewidth enhancement factor (LEF) plays an \nimportant role in controlling the optical coherence. Being intersubband devices, QCLs have an \nintrinsically small LEF, thus serving as better candidates over interband lasers for PCDFB \napplications. We demonstrate electrically pumped, room temperature, single mode operation of \nphotonic crystal distributed feedback quantum cascade lasers emitting at λ ~ 4.75 μm. Ridge \nwaveguides of 50 μm and 100 μm width were fabricated with both PCDFB and Fabry-Perot \nfeedback mechanisms. The Fabry-Perot device has a broad emitting spectrum and a broad far-\nfield character.  The PCDFB devices have primarily a single spectral mode and a diffraction \nlimited far field characteristic with a full angular width at half-maximum of 4.8 degrees and 2.4 \ndegrees for the 50 μm and 100 μm ridge widths, respectively. \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n \n High power, single mode, mid-infrared laser sources are highly desirable for a number of \napplications, such as countermeasures, free space communication and remote chemical detection. \nBesides the constant effort devoted to improving the light generation mechanism within the \nemitting core materials, which fundamentally governs the capability of high power operation, \nnovel and superior laser cavities need to be developed to ensure robust single mode operation. \nAlthough the wall plug efficiency of the current state-of-art quantum cascade lasers (QCL) \nreaches close to 10% [1], the single mode maximum output power is limited by the lack of a \nproper laser cavity.  \n \n Broad area QCLs are natural candidates to produce multi-watt peak power, however, as \nthe gain width increases, multi-mode operation happens due to poorer lateral mode \ndistinguishability. In addition, nonlinear phenomena like spatial hole burning and filamentation \nbecomes more pronounced. As such, the beam coherence cannot be maintained and divergence \nfar from diffraction limited angles occurs, which prevents the conventional broad area Fabry-\nPerot device for single mode operation. \n \n The angled-grating DFB (α-DFB) [2] uses a tilted grating with respect to the laser facet. \nDue to enhanced lateral spatial coupling, filamentation can be strongly suppressed. Although α-\nDFB has been demonstrated capable of producing nearly diffraction limited spatial beam quality, \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1076 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1076-K07-01 \n  \n \n   \n the spectral single mode operation is difficult to achieve due to the inefficient longitudinal \nfeedback, which is otherwise proven to be very effective in the conventional 1D-DFB [3-5].  \n \n An approach that combines both the spatial beam quality of the α-DFB and the spectral \nbeam quality of the 1-D DFB is the photonic crystal distributed feedback (PCDFB) laser [6], \nwhich generalizes the 1-D grating geometry to a 2-D pattern, allowing single mode operation \nboth in far field and spectrum. For PCDFB laser performances, the linewidth enhancement factor \n(LEF) plays an important role in controlling the optical coherence [7]. Being intersubband \ndevices, QCLs have an intrinsically small LEF [8], which makes them better candidates over \ninterband lasers for PCDFB applications. Optically pumped PCDFB was demonstrated on type-II \ninterband cascade lasers (ICL) at λ ~ 4.4 μm [9]. Recently, electrically pumped PCDFB was \ndemonstrated on 980 nm InGaAs/AlGaAs interband lasers [10]. Here, we report electrically \npumped PCDFB quantum cascade lasers emitting at λ ~ 4.75 μm. \n \nEXPERIMENT \n \nPCDFB design \n \n We started with the same QCL wafer as that in Ref. [3], which had a 30- stage-QCL core \nfollowed by a 10 nm InP etch stop layer and a 100 nm GaInAs grating layer. The envisioned \nPCDFB structure after a 4μm InP cladding regrowth is sketched in figure 1(a). A targeting \nwavelength of λ = 4.75 μm is chosen based on the emission spectra of the Fabry-Perot lasers in \nRef. [3]. Using a 1-D effective index method, the transverse fundamental mode is calculated, \nresulting a refractive index contrast for the 100 nm grating layer of Δn = 0.00797. The calculated \neffective index for the fundamental mode is neff = 3.196, following an 1-D effective index \nmethod. \n \n  \nFigure 1. (a) Sketch of the PCDFB structure and SEM pictures for (b) top view of the etched \nSiO2 surface, (c) oblique view of the etched GaInAs holes before the removal of SiO2, and (d) \ncross section of the regrowth. \n  \n  \n \n   \n  \nThe PCDFB device in this work incorporated a first order photonic crystal lattice with \n \n circular elements and rectangular symmetry. The ratio of the lattice constants in two directions is \nset to be an integer number of 3. Fig. 2 sketches the primitive cell of the pattern in both real and \nreciprocal spaces. The lattice constants in the two directions are given by  \n \n  \n \n ( )1 eff/ 2 sinnλ φΛ =          (1) \n \nand  \n \n \n ( )2 eff/ 2 cosnλ φΛ = ,         (2) \n \nwhere φ  is the tilt angle of the 2D lattice, which reads  \n \n \n 1 1tan 18\n3\n \n φ − ⎛ ⎞= ≈\n⎜ ⎟\n \n ⎝ ⎠\n \n o .         (3) \n \n  \nThe calculated periods of the first order PCDFB are Λ1 = 2.349 μm and Λ2 = 0.783 μm in the \ntwo primary axes, respectively. Tolerance of effective index calculation error is introduced by \nexposing three PCDFB gratings with Λ2 = 0.77 μm, 0.78 μm and 0.79 μm, while keeping Λ1 = 3 \nΛ2. The later testing result shows that the first grating, instead of the second, produces room \ntemperature operation at 4.75 μm, with the threshold from the other two longer gratings beyond \nthe maximum current density that the devices can sustain. This indicates some underestimation \nof the effective index resulting from the simple 1-D effective index method. A more accurate \nestimation for the effective index would be neff = 3.251 and can be used for future processing of \nthe same wafer. \n \n \n 2π/Λ1\n \n Λ2\n \n r\nφ\n \n 1 2\n \n 1\n \n tanφ − ⎛ ⎞Λ=\n⎜ ⎟Λ\n⎝ ⎠\n \n G1\n \n G-1\n \n G2\n \n G-2\n \n Real space Reciprocal space\n \n Λ1\n2π/Λ2\n \n 2π/Λ1\n \n Λ2\n \n r\nφ\n \n 1 2\n \n 1\n \n tanφ − ⎛ ⎞Λ=\n⎜ ⎟Λ\n⎝ ⎠\n \n G1\n \n G-1\n \n G2\n \n G-2\n \n Real space Reciprocal space\n \n Λ1\n2π/Λ2\n \n  \nFigure 2.

We define a hole size factor β, which is the \nratio of the hole diameter to the smaller lattice constant Λ2.

(8) \n \n \n Figure 3 shows the calculated coupling coefficients κ1\u2019, κ2\u2019, and κ3\u2019 as a function of the \nhole size factor. Note that for a photonic crystal lattice with circular elements, κ1\u2019 and κ3\u2019 do not \nvanish at β = 1, which is in distinct contrast to the case with square elements. As a result, the \nrange of the hole size factor can be extended to 3. The targeting hole size was chosen where |κ2\u2019| \nis significantly greater than |κ1\u2019| and |κ3\u2019|, and at the same time both |κ1\u2019| and |κ3\u2019| have \nappreciable values [6]. Case A in figue 3 was chosen for the three coupling coefficients of |κ1\u2019| = \n3.4 cm-1, |κ2\u2019| = 22.8 cm-1, and |κ3\u2019| = 4.7 cm-1. The fact that both |κ1\u2019| and |κ3\u2019| do not change \nappreciably for β values slightly bigger than 1, considerably eased the constraints on hole size \ncontrol during e-beam exposure and the following etch procedure.  \n \n Devices with different ridge widths can be processed on the same wafer at the same time \nprovided the e-beam patterns are compatible with the following optical lithography pattern. 50 \nμm and 100 μm ridge widths were fabricated to test the technology for lasers with different sizes \nof gain medium. Note that we were proposing ridge structure devices with a well defined lateral \nsize of the optical mode resulting from the etched channels. As such, the boundary conditions of \nthe optical field would be different from the simulation in Ref. [7], where the optical mode \npenetrates beyond the pumped region and changes as the pumping changes. In order to quantify \nthe far field characteristics, a parameter called \u201cetendue\u201d is introduced in Ref. [7], which takes \ninto account of the changeable near field patterns. As a special case, a diffraction limited far field \npattern corresponds to an etendue value of unity. \n  \n  \n \n   \n 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0\n-20\n \n 0\n \n 20\n \n 40\n \n a\n \n  κ\n1\n'\n \n  κ\n2\n'\n \n  κ\n3\n'\n \n  \nC\n \n o\nup\n \n lin\ng\n \n  c\no\n \n e\nffi\n \n ci\nen\n \n t \n(c\n \n m\n-1\n \n )\n \n Hole size factor\n \n A\n \n B\n \n  \nFigure 3.

The hole size factor is the ratio of the \nhole diameter to the smaller lattice constant Λ2. \n \n  \n \nDevice processing \n \n \n The PCDFB processing started with an 80 nm SiO2 deposition on the GaInAs grating \nlayer, followed by e-beam exposure of the designed pattern on a 100 nm thick e-beam resist. The \n2D grating pattern was transferred to the SiO2 layer by reactive ion etching (RIE). Figure 1(b) \nshows the top view of the pattern on a SiO2 surface. The 100 nm GaInAs grating layer was \netched by electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) RIE at a temperature of 150°C in a Cl2/Ar plasma. \nFigure 1(c) shows the high magnification oblique view of the GaInAs etching results. The \nremaining SiO2 was then removed by buffered HF solution, followed by a short acid treatment \nbefore loading into the metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) chamber for InP \nupper cladding regrowth, which includes a 2 μm thick n- InP layer with graded doping (1-3 x \n1017 cm-3) and a 2 μm thick n+ InP layer (4x1018 cm-3). Shown in Figure 1(d) is the regrowth \ncross section, where the grating on top of the core can be clearly seen. \n \n After regrowth, the wafer was processed into double channel ridge waveguide lasers of \n50 μm and 100 μm ridge widths, using conventional photolithography and nonselective wet \nchemical etching. After insulation deposition, window opening, top contact deposition, \nlapping/polishing, and bottom contact deposition, following the same procedure described in \nRef. [3], the wafer was then cleaved into laser bars with 3 mm cavity length (in a direction \nnormal to the cleaved mirrors) and indium soldered to copper heat sinks with the epilayer side  \n  \n \n   \n up. The device packaging was finished by the gold wire bonding for the top contact. For far field \nand spectrum testing, a pulse width of 200 ns and repetition rate of 10 kHz were used, resulting \nin a duty cycle of 0.2%. Far field measurement was done by mounting the laser on a computer \ncontrolled rotational stage with a minimum step size capability of 0.001°, while a liquid nitrogen \ncooled mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector was placed at a fixed position 30 cm away \nfrom the rotation axis. To improve the angular resolution limited by the rather big sensing area of \nthe detector, a 200 μm slit was put in front of the MCT detector, which ensured an angular \nresolution of less than 0.05°. The laser emission spectrum was measured by a 275 mm \nmonochromator using a 75 g/mm diffraction grating. For output power measurement, the laser \nwas driven at a higher duty cycle of 2% to ensure that sufficient average power would be \nreceived by the calibrated thermopile. \n \n \n Device testing \n \n \n Shown in Fig. 4 are the far field results of the PCDFB laser and the comparison with a \npreviously processed Fabry-Perot laser of the same ridge width and cavity length at the same \ndriving current of 5A. In order to save material for the PCDFB laser fabrication, the broad area \nFabry-Perot laser used for comparison was from another wafer, whose QCL core was supposed \nto be the replica of the PCDFB laser core. The ridge widths of the two devices were the same, \nbeing 50 μm. It is clearly shown that the PCDFB device has a significantly narrower far field, \nwith a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 4.8°, while the conventional Fabry-Perot device \nshows a much broader and irregular far field pattern. \n \n -80 -60 -40 -20 0 20 40 60 80\n \n 0.0\n \n 0.2\n \n 0.4\n \n 0.6\n \n 0.8\n \n 1.0\n PCDFB\n Fabry-Perot\n \n N\nor\n \n m\nal\n \n iz\ned\n \n  In\nte\n \n ns\nity\n \n  (\na.\n \n  u\n.)\n \n Angle (degree)\n \n  \n \n 50 μm \nridge width\n \n  \nFigure 4.

The ridge widths of these devices were 50 μm 100 μm. The far field and \nspectrum were compared with its Fabry-Perot counterpart. Both far field and spectrum of the \nPCDFB laser showed single mode behavior. The far field was diffraction limited. The emitting \nwavelength was 4.755 μm.  Being a proof of concept experiment, the output power of the \nPCDFB device was not optimized and the slope efficiency was about one fifth of its Fabry-Perot \ncounterpart. Once optimized the superior beam quality of the PCDFB quantum cascade laser \nover its Fabry-Perot counterpart opens the possibility of making single-mode, high-power broad \narea mid-infrared semiconductor lasers. \n \n \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n \n The authors would like to acknowledge the support, interest, and encouragement of J. \nMeyer from Naval Research Laboratory, H.

Post-synthetic surface modification of ZrO2 \nnanoparticles using several aliphatic ligands with different surface binding groups such as \ncarboxylate (-COO-), amine (-NH2), phosphate (-PO4) and methoxysilane (-SiOCH3) was \nperformed in order to compare the binding ability of these functional groups to the nanoparticle \nsurface and therefore provide a new rational approach for nanoparticle stabilization with organic \nligands. \n \n \n INTRODUCTION \n \n \n In the field of optoelectronics and photonics, holography is one of the most dynamic \ntechnologies with increasing impact on many applications, including holographic data storage, \nsensors, security holograms and real-time microscopic imaging [1-3]. Its development hinges on \nthe design and fabrication of volume periodic photosensitive composite materials with high \ndiffraction efficiency, fast response and low optical losses. One promising possibility for \nfabricating gratings with high refractive index modulation and high stability is the incorporation \nof inorganic nanoparticles with high refractive index in a photopolymerizable active organic \nmatrix [4-5]. At this point, by taking advantage of their intrinsic high refractive index and \ntransparency, zirconia nanoparticles were successfully explored in an organic-inorganic \nnanocomposite, leading to effective volume phase holographic gratings after holographic \nexposure [6]. The crucial parameter for their successful incorporation is their surface \nmodification, which must ensure complete stability and compatibility of the nanoparticles \nthroughout the grating formation process, preventing agglomeration and thus, high scattering in \nthe nanocomposite gratings. Therefore, the future development and application of such \nnanocomposite holographic devices will crucially depend on the availability of suitable \nnanoparticles with optimized surface structure [4-8]. \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1076 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1076-K05-03 \n  \n \n   \n Recently we have presented a scalable one-pot solvothermal route to monodisperse, \nhighly crystalline zirconia (ZrO2) nanoparticles with yields of 20 g per batch [6]. Using fatty \nacids as surface-modifies, stable dispersions in chloroform were obtained that could be used for \nthe fabrication of nanocomposites in photocurable isooctyl acrylate (IOA)-based organic \nmatrices. Whilst fatty acids with various chain lengths were explored to assess the effect of chain \nlength on the stabilization, the carboxylic acid group as anchor group to the zirconia surface was \nnot varied [6]. Here, we present a study of the effect of different surface binding groups of \naliphatic ligands on the particle stabilization both in organic solvents and the IOA host. \nCarboxylate (-COO-), amine (-NH2), phosphate (-PO4) and methoxysilane (-SiOCH3) were used \nas functional groups, representing the commonly used functional groups for stabilization of \nmetal oxides today. Additionally, we performed investigations on the influence of the synthesis \nconditions on the particle dispersibility, to gain further insight into the stabilization mechanism.  \n \n \n EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS \n \n For the synthesis, 66.6 g of zirconium (IV) isopropoxide isopropanol complex (Aldrich, \n99.9%), or 77.2 ml zirconium (IV) n-propoxide in 1-propanol (70wt %, Aldrich) was added to \n500 ml of benzyl alcohol (Aldrich, ≥99%) in a Teflon reaction cup. This was inserted into a 1 l \nbench top reactor (Parr instruments), which was heated to 210°C under continuous stirring for 3 \ndays. When using zirconium (IV) n-propoxide, the solvothermal reaction was conducted at \n220°C to obtain comparable yields. In both cases, the product was isolated as a white powder by \ncentrifugation and washing with ethanol. For the functionalization treatments, the ZrO2 \nnanoparticles were not dried after washing but suitable solutions of the ligands (containing 10 \nmg of ligand/ml CHCl3) were added immediately after decantation of ethanol, followed by \nsonication for 20 min. \n \n  X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 diffractometer \nequipped with a scintillation counter using Cu-Kα radiation with a scanning step size of 0.04°/2θ. \nThe infrared spectra of the samples were recorded using a diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier \ntransform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) Bruker Equinox IFS 55 device, under accumulation of 64 \nscans. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed with a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA851 \ninstrument in a flowing oxygen atmosphere employing a heating rate of 10°C min\u00961.  \n \n \n DISCUSSION  \n \n \n The XRD patterns of ZrO2 nanoparticles prepared using the two different zirconia \nprecursors are displayed in Figure 1. As reported in our previous work [6], purely cubic zirconia \n(JCPDC 27-991) is obtained when using zirconium (IV) isopropoxide isopropanol complex as \nprecursor (a). Nonetheless, it is highly attractive to use other precursors such as zirconium (IV) \nn-propoxide as starting material because of their substantially lower cost. Also when using \nzirconium (IV) n-propoxide solution in 1-propanol, highly crystalline nanoparticles were \nobtained as visible in the XRD pattern of the dried nanoparticles in Figure 1 (b). The \ncharacteristic ZrO2 peaks at 30.2°, 35.2°, 50.5° and 60.1° are seen, but due to significant line \nbroadening, it is difficult to assign the peaks specifically to either the cubic or tetragonal phase. \nAdditionally, peaks at 28.1° and at 24.4° and 40.6° are visible that correspond to monoclinic \nzirconia (JCPDC 37-1484). The particle size was calculated to 2.8 nm for sample (a) using a \nquantitative line broadening analysis of the (220) diffraction peak, and to 5 nm for (b).  \n  \n \n   \n   \n \n Even without any additional ligand, the as-prepared ZrO2 nanoparticles are slightly \ndispersible in chloroform, obtaining clear dispersions with solid contents of about 10 mg/ml, \nowing to organic species bound to the particles that stem from the synthesis, especially the \nsolvent benzyl alcohol. The long term stability of these dispersions however was not good \n(agglomerates started to form within a day), and the concentration of the nanoparticles in various \nnon-polar organic solvents that need to be used for the preparation of nanocomposites suitable \nfor volume holography is not sufficient to achieve a high diffraction performance. To improve \ncolloidal stability of the ZrO2 nanoparticles in non-polar media, and to gain an insight into the \nbinding capability of various organic functional groups to the zirconia surface, we explored the \nuse of four different aliphatic ligands with various functional groups: arachidic acid, \ntrimethoxy(octyl)silane (OTMS), di(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate and dodecylamine. \n \n In all cases, transparent dispersions with solid nanoparticle contents of about 100 mg/ml \nwere obtained directly after adding the corresponding functionalization solution to the wet \nnanoparticles after the washing step. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy \n(DRIFTS) was performed in order to investigate the binding of the ligands to the nanoparticle \nsurface, using the solid after precipitation with methanol and drying. The obtained spectra of the \nZrO2 nanoparticles modified with different ligands are given in Figure 2 and are compared to \nunmodified ZrO2 nanoparticles. In addition to the characteristic absorption band of Zr-O-Zr \nvibrations below 600 cm-1, the as-prepared ZrO2 nanoparticles exhibit a series of peaks around \n1400-1600 cm-1, corresponding to aromatic benzyl alcohol species adsorbed to the nanoparticles \nduring the synthesis. According to the TGA data presented in Figure 3, the obtained ZrO2 \nnanoparticles exhibit a weight loss of 8.6%, in a pronounced step between 360 and 460°C, which \ncorresponds to a decomposition/combustion of surface organics. These organic species can make \nthe as-prepared nanoparticles dispersible in certain media, for instance, in chloroform, but also \nfacilitate subsequent post-synthetic surface modification due to easy exchange to surface \nmodifiers. We have recently discovered that other species adsorbed after drying of the \n \n  \n    Figure 2. DRIFT spectra of ZrO2   \n    nanoparticles before (a) and after surface  \n    modification with arachidic acid (b),  \n    dodecylamine (c), OTMS (d) and di(2- \n    ethylhexyl)phosphate (e).   \n \n  \n \n \n Figure 1. XRD patterns of the ZrO2 \nnanoparticles prepared from zirconium (IV) \nisopropoxide isopropanol complex (a) and \nzirconium (IV) n-propoxide (b)  \n  \n \n   \n nanoparticles, especially moisture, do not desorb and thus impede the surface modification, \nrendering the nanoparticles much less dispersible [9].  \n \n As shown in Figure 2 (b), the arachidic acid-modified ZrO2 nanoparticles exhibit \ncharacteristic bands of bidendate carboxylate stretching vibrations at 1548 and 1467 cm-1, \ndemonstrating a complete replacement of benzyl alcohol from the nanoparticle surface. Since \nposition and relative intensity of the methylene antisymmetric and symmetric vibrations are \nknown to be highly sensitive to the spatial conformations of the aliphatic chains [10-11], the \npeaks at 2920 and 2851 cm-1 suggest a closely packed and crystalline-like state of the aliphatic \nchains around the nanoparticles. Among all the studied ligands, only arachidic acid shows such \nan all-trans conformation in the alkyl chains on the surface of ZrO2 nanoparticles. This indicates \nthat arachidic acid forms a stable and densely packed monolayer on the nanoparticles through the \nstrong interaction of the carboxylic acid head groups with the zirconium species on the particle \nsurface. A high load of organics (~25%), decomposing in a narrow temperature range of 285-\n300°C as shown by the TGA measurement in Figure 3 (e), supports this result of a rather densely \npacked, uniform arachidic acid shell around the nanoparticles.   \n \n In the DRIFT spectrum of the \nOTMS-stabilized nanoparticles, in addition \nto the stretching vibration of the Si-O bond \nat 1049 cm-1 [12], the peaks from initially \nadsorbed benzyl alcohol species are still \nobserved at 1400-1600 cm-1, indicating only \npartial replacement by OTMS. This result is \nfurther confirmed by thermogravimetric \nanalysis. Whilst the normal TGA plot \n(Figure 3 (d)) suggests rather slow \ndecomposition of the organic ligands, in the \nderivative curve (not shown here), three \nindividual weight loss steps could be \ndistinguished, with a total of 12% organics. \nA major loss related to decomposition of \nsurface bound ligands occurred in the \ntemperature range of 250-350°C, followed \nby final loss at 400°C which coincides with \nthat of unmodified ZrO2 nanoparticles, \n \n additionally suggesting that benzyl alcohol species are still present after surface modification. \nFrom the TGA plot, the ratio of OTMS to benzyl alcohol could be estimated as approx. 2.5. A \nsimilar trend was observed for dodecylamine-stabilized ZrO2 nanoparticles (Figure 2 (c)). The \nN-H deformation vibration of the amine group at around 1600 cm-1 is probably overlapping with \nthat of surface organics. The ZrO2 nanoparticles stabilized with di(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate \nexhibited several DRIFTS absorption peaks at 1022, 1089 and 1191 cm-1, corresponding to P-O  \nand P-O-C stretching vibrations [13]. As can be seen from Figure 3 (d), the thermogram of ZrO2 \nnanoparticles stabilized with di(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate shows a gradual decrease in weight up \nto 500°C, with a final loss of 17.6%, which corresponds to decomposition of surface bound \nligands, proving the binding of di(2-ethylhexyl) phosphonate to the ZrO2 surface. \n \n  \n \n Figure 3. TGA curves of the ZrO2 nanoparticles \nbefore (a) and after surface modification with \ndodecylamine (b), OTMS (c), di(2-\nethylhexyl)phosphate (d) and arachidic acid (e).    \n  \n \n   \n Interestingly, the yield of \nnanoparticles from the solvothermal \nsynthesis as well as their \ndispersibility in particular media are \nstrongly dependent on the reaction \nconditions. Here, we discuss the \ndependence of reaction yield and \ndispersibility on the synthesis \ntemperature. To study the \ndispersibility of the nanoparticles \nafter post-functionalization with \narachidic acid, the maximum \nconcentration of the nanoparticles in \nhomogeneous dispersion were \ndetermined by preparing \nconcentrated suspensions in the \n \n functionalization solution. After sonication for 20 min, the turbid liquids were centrifuged in \norder to remove all agglomerated nanoparticles, resulting in transparent dispersions in all cases. \nThe solid content of these dispersions was determined gravimetrically by heating at 400°C. As \nshown in Figure 4, as the reaction temperature rises from 200 to 240°C, the obtained yield of \nnanoparticles increases drastically. At the same time, the maximum solid content of the \ndispersions decreases significantly above 230°C. The relatively low yield of ZrO2 nanoparticles \nat a reaction temperature of 200°C may however be partly due not to incomplete reaction, but to \na good stabilization of the nanoparticles also in benzyl alcohol, therefore making them \nimpossible to separate from the solvent by centrifugation (as was performed here). This is \nsupported by the increasing stability of the nanoparticles after post-functionalization, which \npossibly points to a high stability also before the functionalization. At higher synthesis \ntemperatures, we infer that the number of surface binding sites of the zirconia nanoparticles is \nreduced, possibly due to enhanced ripening and elimination of surface defects of the \nnanocrystals.   \n \n In order to assess the capability of the ligands for stabilization in photocurable isooctyl \nacrylate (IOA)-based organic matrices for the preparation of volume holographic devices, we \nadded dispersions of the stabilized nanoparticles to the IOA monomer, followed by evaporation \nof the volatile organic solvent to obtain nanoparticle-IOA composites with a ZrO2 content up to \n15 wt%.  All dispersions can initially be mixed with IOA to obtain transparent liquids. The \ndispersions with dodecylamine and di(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate-stabilized nanoparticles however \nbecame turbid within 30 minutes, showing that these only weakly attached ligands are desorbed \nquickly due to destabilization of the bond between their functional head groups and the zirconia \nsurface when a third component is introduced to the system, consequently leading to \nagglomeration of the ZrO2 nanoparticles. The arachidic acid and OTMS-stabilized nanoparticles \nremained stable and non-agglomerated in the IOA matrix even after complete evaporation of the \nsolvent, demonstrating their strong interaction with zirconia through multidendate coordination, \nas already confirmed with DRIFTS and TGA. Clearly, the arachidic acid and OTMS-stabilized \nZrO2 nanoparticles exhibit better compatibility with IOA owing to their stronger binding affinity \nfor zirconia.  \n \n  \n \nFigure 4. Dependence of reaction yield and \ndispersibility on the synthesis temperature  \n  \n \n   \n CONCLUSIONS \n \n \n Highly crystalline zirconia nanoparticles with an average diameter of 3-5 nm were \nsynthesized via a non-aqueous route in benzyl alcohol using zirconium (IV) isopropoxide \nisopropanol complex or zirconium (IV) n-propoxide as precursor. The dispersibility of the \nresulting ZrO2 nanoparticles in non-polar solvents can be strongly enhanced by binding organic \nstabilizers (ligands) to the nanoparticle surface. The stability of the nanoparticles is thereby \nstrongly dependent on the binding strength of the functional head group of the used ligand. \nChelating ligands such as carboxylic acids and silanes bind to the nanoparticle surface in a stable \nfashion and therefore result in stable dispersions at high solid contents. On the other hand, our \nresults highlight the importance of reaction variables such as the reaction temperature on the \nperformance of resultant ZrO2 nanoparticles besides the chemical characteristics of the stabilizer \nfor achieving optimum stabilization of the nanoparticles. Applying the gained insights for a \ntuning of the synthesis and post-functionalization treatments, highly stable nanocomposites of \nthe nanoparticles can also be achieved in the photocurable organic monomer IOA, providing \nmeans for the optimization of the nanoparticle components for efficient holographic gratings.   \n \n   \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n  \nWe thank Prof. Dr. H.

These detectors were intended for ground, airborne, and space \nborne remote sensing applications. Discussion will be focused on recently developed \nsingle-element infrared detector and future development of near-infrared focal plane \narrays (FPA). The FPA will be applied to next generation space-based instruments. These \nactivities are based on phototransistor and avalanche photodiode technologies, which \noffer high internal gain and relatively low noise-equivalent-power. These novel devices \nwill improve the sensitivity of active remote sensing instruments while eliminating the \nneed for a high power laser transmitter. \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n \n NASA\u0092s Earth Science Technology Office and Science Mission Directorate show \ngreat interest in broadband detectors for numerous critical applications such as \ntemperature sensing, process control, and atmospheric monitoring of trace gases (CO2, \nH2O, CO, and CH4). When selecting a detector for such applications, key parameters, \nmust be considered in order to satisfy the requirements of the Earth and planetary remote \nsensing systems. These parameters include spectral response, quantum efficiency, noise-\nequivalent-power (NEP), and gain. In general, large format focal plane arrays (FPA) in \nthe 1.0 to 2.5 µm spectral range are the detectors of choice for the next-generation Earth \nand Space Science remote sensing, Mars Orbiter, and planetary instruments. An \nAntimonide (Sb)-based heterojunction phototransistor (HPT), as a suitable candidate, \nstimulates a strong interest for broadband remote sensing applications [1-4]. Besides p-i-n \nphotodiodes and avalanche photodiodes (APD), HPTs have also attracted a great \nattention to satisfy many of the detector requirements for these applications without \nexcess noise and high bias voltage problems, while maintaining superior NEP. HPT has \nan internal gain mechanism that allows increasing the output signal and signal-to-noise \nratio (SNR). However, further reduction of gain related noise is desirable, and research \non different HPT structures indicate some important design considerations that can \nminimize device noise and further increase the SNR. \n \n On the other hand, APDs are integrated solid-state semiconductor devices that \nmanufactured using different materials. The common near-IR InGaAs/InP APDs are \noperational in the spectral range of 0.9 to 1.6 µm [5-7]. Recently, a group from DRS \nTechnologies demonstrated responsivity of ~ 15 A/W using HgCdTe electron (e-) APD at \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1076 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1076-K03-04 \n  \n \n   \n short wave infrared (SWIR) wavelength (at -7 V and 20oC) [7]. However, HgCdTe e- \nAPDs have demonstrated very high responsivity in the 3.0 to 5.0 µm range and their \nSWIR responsivity was low [7]. Even though HgCdTe detectors are efficient in the \ninfrared range, significant technology limitations curb their application in that range. \nTherefore, researchers have been looking to other III-V systems that provide much higher \nyield by manufacturing and higher operability. In this context, it is necessary to explore \nalternative material systems, which can absorb radiation in the 1.0 to 2.5 µm range and \nare compatible with general requirements of a low-noise detector. InGaAsSb/AlGaAsSb \nheterostructures are very suitable for this application, and single-element HPTs based on \nthese heterostructures demonstrated record responsivitites [3, 4, 8-14]. \n \n Quaternary InGaAsSb/AlGaAsSb HPTs in the 1.0 to 2.5 µm wavelength range have \nbeen developed and fabricated at AstroPower, Inc. in collaboration with NASA Langley \nResearch Center (LaRC). These devices have been characterized at NASA LaRC and \nencouraging results have been obtained, including high responsivity, high detectivity, and \nrelatively low NEP [3,4, 8-14]. Development of large-format Sb-based phototransistor \nFPA will enhance the capability of space-based active and passive remote sensing \nimaging systems and enable major advances in Astronomical, Earth, and planetary \ninstruments. This new detector will enhance the capability of active remote sensing of \nCO2 and water vapor at 2.05 and 1.9 µm, respectively. \n \n There is no commercially available broadband detector with sufficient sensitivity in \nthe 1.0  to 2.5 µm spectral range, whereas this spectral range is suitable for sounding \nEarth and planetary atmospheres. Therefore, we propose to develop the capability to \nreliably fabricate detector arrays that respond to broad near-IR wavelength regions.  \n \n \nDEMONSTRATION OF SINGLE ELEMENT INFRARED DETECTOR \n \n \n Recently, NASA LaRC characterized single-element InGaAsSb/AlGaAsSb HPTs \nwith a 200 µm diameter. Figure 1 shows the responsivity variation with wavelength in the \n0.6 to 2.4 µm range at different collector-emitter voltages and temperatures of such a \ndevice [11]. The responsivity is strongly dependent on wavelength, temperature, and bias \nvoltage. A maximum responsivity of 10000 A/W was achieved at 1.9 µm, -193oC and 5V. \nThat was the highest responsivity ever reported in the 0.6 to 2.4 µm wavelength range for \nthe Sb-based photodetectors. \n \n Figure 2 compares the NEP variation with bias voltage of a HPT and of commercial \nInGaAs p-i-n photodiodes (Hamamatsu; G5852 and G5853) at different wavelengths \n[10]. The photodiodes have different cutoff wavelengths: 2.6 µm for G5853 and 2.3 µm \nfor G5852. It was determined that at 2.0 µm, NEP of G5852 (top solid lines at -20 oC) is \nabout five times lower compared to G5853. Comparison with the best of the tested p-i-n \nphotodiodes shows that at 4.0 V the HPT achieves near an order of magnitude lower NEP \ndespite the 40 degrees higher operating temperature (20oC). Furthermore, this HPT was \nalso operated at -20oC and NEP was reduced to 1.83x10-14 W/Hz 2\n \n 1\n at the same operating \n \n conditions. \n \n \n  \n  \n \n   \n   \n 600 1000 1400 1800 2200\n10-2\n \n 100\n \n 102\n \n 104\n \n Wavelength [nm]\n \n R\nes\n \n po\nns\n \n iv\nity\n \n  [\nA\n \n /W\n]\n \n 20oC & 0V\n \n 20oC & 4V 70oC & 2V\n \n -193oC & 0V\n \n -193oC & 5V\n \n 600 1000 1400 1800 2200\n10-2\n \n 100\n \n 102\n \n 104\n \n Wavelength [nm]\n \n R\nes\n \n po\nns\n \n iv\nity\n \n  [\nA\n \n /W\n]\n \n 20oC & 0V\n \n 20oC & 4V 70oC & 2V\n \n -193oC & 0V\n \n -193oC & 5V\n \n  \nFigure 1.

The NEP of the p-i-n photodiodes were measured at \n2.0 µm, 1.0 V and -20oC.  \n  \n \n   \n  \n \n \n In addition, commercial APDs were acquired and characterized at NASA LaRC. \nSpectral response measurements of InGaAs APDs from Perkin-Elmer (APD1 with 80 µm \ndiameter) and Sensors Unlimited Inc./Goodrich (APD2 with 200 µm) were performed. \nFigure 3 shows responsivity curves as a function of wavelength of the InGaAs APDs and \nphototransistor. The selected biases for the APDs were 52.0 V and 53.4 V at 20oC as \nspecified by the manufacturers and the bias voltage for HPT was 4.0 V at -20oC. These \ntwo APDs have similar cutoff wavelengths near 1.7 µm, but the HPT has the cutoff at \napproximately 2.1 µm. The following responsivities were determined: above 100 A/W \n(20oC and 53.4 V) for APD2 and about 85 A/W (20oC and 52.0 V) for APD1 at 1.6 µm \nwavelength; and about 260A/W (20oC and 3.0 V) and 1700 A/W (-20oC and 4.0 V) for \nthe phototransistor at 2.0 µm.

We \nbelieve that these discrepancies are due to the higher noise of APD2 and the \nphototransistor as compared to APD1. \n \n  \n \n \n 1.0 1.4 1.8 2.2\nWavelength (µm)\n \n 10-14\n \n 10-13\n \n 10-12\nN\n \n E\nP\n \n  (\nW\n \n /H\nz1/\n \n 2 )\n \n APD1 @ 20\n \n o\n \n C & 52.0V\n \n APD2 @ 20\n \n o\n \n C & 53.4V\n \n HPT @ -20\n \n o\n \n C & 4.0V\n \n HPT @ 20\n \n o\n \n C & 3.0V\n \n 1.0 1.4 1.8 2.2\nWavelength (µm)\n \n 10-14\n \n 10-13\n \n 10-12\nN\n \n E\nP\n \n  (\nW\n \n /H\nz1/\n \n 2 )\n \n APD1 @ 20\n \n o\n \n C & 52.0V\n \n APD2 @ 20\n \n o\n \n C & 53.4V\n \n HPT @ -20\n \n o\n \n C & 4.0V\n \n HPT @ 20\n \n o\n \n C & 3.0V\n \n  \nFigure 4. Comparison of NEP between the APDs and the phototransistor at the same \noperating conditions (20oC and -20oC). \n \n \n \n The HPTs have longer wavelength sensitivity and comparably short wavelength \nsensitivity, which is an attractive solution for the broadband imaging systems. The \nattraction to this solution is because the easiest way to acquire broadband imaging is to \nuse a single detector array with simple optics and electronics. For commercial \ntechnologies (for example, Si-cutoff 1.1 µm and InGaAs: 1.7 or extended 2.6 µm \ndetectors), each wavelength band requires a separate detector with appropriate dichroic, \nfocusing optics, support electronics, cooling, and mounting hardware. These requirements \nfor additional components increase the size of an imaging system, resulting in increased \npower consumption, weight, and cost. Therefore, the broadband approach is being \npursued because it offers an advantage of simple, efficient, cost-effective, lightweight, \nand compact instrument design. Broadband phototransistor arrays proposed to the NASA \nEarth-Sun Systems Division (ESSD) technology program for the active and passive \nremote sensing instrument will operate in the spectral range of 0.6 \u0096 2.5 µm and extend \nthis technology to flight missions for the next generation. For the broad-spectral active \nand passive instrument, we will select regions that cover only interest lines (e.g., CO2, \nCH4, H2O, CO) with higher resolution within those bands. \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n   \n FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF NEAR-INFRARED DETECTOR FPA \n \n \n The record results achieved with discrete 200-µm diameter HPTs provide a base for \ndesigning and fabrication of arrays of these devices. However, fabrication of the arrays is \na challenging task. It requires a very high level of homogeneity of InGaAsSb/AlGaAsSb \nepitaxial layers, including their thickness, doping and chemical composition. For this \npurpose we are planning to use the Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) - growth method. \nThis method provides precisely controlled and reproducible growth of the required \nmultilayer InGaAsSb/AlGaAsSb/GaSb heterostructure on the area of up to 4 cm2.  This \nepitaxial growth was successfully used by the University of Delaware-NASA team for \nfabrication of the first room temperature HPT with the cutoff wavelength of 2.4 µm [15]. \n \n There are no reports regarding fabrication of arrays of Sb-based photodetectors with \ninternal gain (APDs or phototransistors), and only few reports about SWIR arrays of \nInGaAs and HgCdTe APDs. For example; Sensors Unlimited developed 32 x 32 arrays of \nInGaAs APDs on a 100 µm pitch for 1.55 µm wavelength [16] and DRS reported about \nfirst HgCdTe APD arrays [17]. NASA LaRC is interested in 2-D arrays fabrication and \nhybridization in cooperation with the University of Delaware (UD) and a start-up \ncompany Advanced Optical Materials, LLC, related to the antimonide based \nphototransistors.  \n \n \n \n SUMMARY \n \n \n We have demonstrated current single-element infrared detectors and future \ndevelopment of near-infrared focal plane arrays (FPA) for applications to next generation \nspace-based instruments. Most of these activities are based on phototransistor technology, \nwhich is offering high internal gain and low NEP operation. Developed phototransistors \nshowed higher responsivity and higher gain with a light collecting area diameter of 200 \nµm. Spectral response measurements and NEP calculations were carried out to the \nphototransistor to achieve the responsivity at 2.0 µm and NEP is several times lower than \ncommercially available state-of-the-art p-i-n photodiodes. On the other hand, \nphototransistor has achieved two-order-of-magnitude higher responsivity as compare to \nAPDs, despite the higher NEP as compare to Perkin-Elmer APD and lower NEP with \nrespect to SUI/Goodrich APD at near room temperature operation. These new \nphototransistors will improve the sensitivity of the passive remote sensing instruments \nand reduce the laser transmitter power for active remote sensing instruments, while \neliminating the need for high breakdown voltage avalanche photodiode. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \n1.

Da \nVinci, 33, Milano, 20133, Italy \n2IFN-CNR, Milano, 20133, Italy \n \nABSTRACT \n \n \n As non-volatile memory technology is approaching the 45nm generation node and con-\nventional Flash technology is facing severe scaling limitations, phase-change memory (PCM) is \ngaining momentum as a reference emerging memory. However, much development is still \nneeded at technology, device and material levels, which in turn requires a significant improve-\nment of the physical understanding of programming, reliability mechanisms and scalability of \nthe new technology. This work reviews the most recent advances on modeling concerning PCM, \nspanning from program and read operations to device reliability. Electro-thermal simulations are \nemployed to address the reduction of programming current for the reset operation (i.e., the transi-\ntion to the high resistive amorphous state), and the trade-off with readout performances will be \ndiscussed and analyzed. Then, reliability issues concerning the stability of the programmed \namorphous phase will be investigated, with particular interest on the spontaneous crystallization \nleading to data-loss. Starting from electrical retention measurements, an analytical model for nu-\ncleation and growth in the amorphous phase will allow to draw guidelines for material engineer-\ning and reliability improvement, which will be addressed on the basis of reported experimental \nresults on different chalcogenide materials. \n \n  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n \n In the field of non volatile memories, phase change memory (PCM) has shown to be a \npromising emerging technology in the last few years, long after the original proposal in the \nseminal paper by Ovshinsky [1]. Indeed, PCM extended cycling endurance, good retention and \neasy integration has motivated large interest from several semiconductor industries and several \ntest demonstrators have been developed for PCM, which nowadays appears as the most promis-\ning memory concept for replacing Flash memory in the near future [2-4].  \n \n In PCM, data are stored in the crystalline or amorphous phase of an active chalcogenide \nmaterial. This can be achieved by heating up the material with external pulses, in order either to \nmelt and quench the material in the amorphous phase (which provides the high resistive state), or \nto accelerate its transition to the crystalline phase (which provides the low resistive state). \nNowadays, positive performances have been demonstrated, nevertheless several critical and open \nissues remain in the understanding of the reliability and scaling limitation of this technology. \n \n Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 1072 © 2008 Materials Research Society 1072-G06-05 \n  \n \n   \n One major concern regards the reset programming operation, where an electrical pulse is \napplied to the cell in order to obtain a high resistive, or reset, state. Indeed, reset programming \nrequires melting and fast quenching of the active material, hence large temperatures are to be ob-\ntained by Joule heating, which in turn requires relatively large applied currents. Up to date, test \ndemonstrators typically require several hundreds of µA, which raises potential limitations on the \nminimum area of the cell MOS selector, hence on overall memory density [5]. Also, simultane-\nous programming of several cells and overall write throughput are limited by the cell reset cur-\nrent at a given current capability [6]. As a response to this issue, several approaches for reducing \nthe programming current have been proposed, including material and cell engineering [5,7]. An-\nother timely topic regards the stability of the amorphous phase, which suffers from spontaneous \nstructural relaxation and crystallization [8-11]. Since the standard requirement for any non-\nvolatile memory is to hold the stored data at least for ten years, amorphous instability raises a \npotential data-retention issue. In the following, we address modeling of both programming and \nretention in PCM, drawing the attention to the most important material parameters involved, and \non possible cell geometry and material optimization. \n \n \nPROGRAM-READ PERFORMANCES \n \n \n Electro-thermal model \nProgramming and readout cell performances were studied by means of a numerical model \n \n for PCM, which accounts for 3D electrical and heat transport, as well as for phase transition of \nthe active chalcogenide from the crystalline to the amorphous phase and vice-versa [12].  Fig. 1 \nshows the comparison between experimental results and calculation according to our model. On \nthe left side, Fig. 1a shows measured and calculated current versus voltage, or I-V, curves for a \ntypical cell in the crystalline, or set, state. In the same figure, the inset shows a schematic cross \nsection of the experimental sample. This is a so-called lance cell, where  a layer of GST is con-\ntacted at the bottom by a pillar-shaped heater [3]. On the left side of the figure, Fig. 1b, measured \nand calculated R-I programming curves are reported, where programmed resistance R is reported \nas a function of programming current I. In reported measurements and calculations, the cell is \ninitially in set state, then R increases for applied currents increasingly larger than the melting cur-\nrent Im, as an increasing larger portion of GST is melted and amorphized. The good matching \nbetween data and calculations was obtained by calibrating material electrical and thermal pa-\nrameters on cells of different geometries. Employed values are reported in Table I [13]. \n \n  \nTable I: electrical resistivities ρ and thermal conductivities κ used in our simulator for materials \nemployed in the experimental cell. \n \n \n  GST Doped TiN Insulator \nρ [mΩ cm] 17 2.5 ∞ \nκ [W/(K m)] 1 12 0.7 \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n   \n a) b) \n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n \n Current [µA]\n10\n \n 3\n \n 10\n4\n \n 10\n5\n \n 10\n6\n \n 10\n7\n \n R\nes\n \n is\nta\n \n nc\ne \n \n [Ω\n]\n \n Data\nCalculated\n \n Im\n \n Rset\n \n  \n \nFig. 1: Measured and calculated I-V (a) and programming R-I characteristics (b) for a set-state \nPCM cell. In Fig. 1a, the inset schematically shows cell geometry.  \n \n \n \n Geometry optimization and scaling \nAs already stated above, the reduction of the reset programming current is a key issue for \n \n PCM technology. Nevertheless, proposed approached, such as contact area scaling and increase \nof material resistivity [3,14-15], also increase the resistance of the set state, Rset. This, in turn, \nraises a potential readout issue, since a larger Rset implies longer times to charge the parasitic bit \nline capacitance and slower read access. Therefore, geometry and material engineering have to \naim at the optimization of the program-readout trade-off.  \n \n For geometrical optimization, we refer to the vertical cell structure in the inset of Fig 1a. \nThis can be considered as a test example, therefore qualitative results can be addressed also to \nother vertical cell concepts proposed in the literature, such as µtrench , ring and pore structure \n[2-3,14]. The purpose of the optimization is to find the most proper size of the bottom electrode \nLh and of the chalcogenide layer Lc, so that the temperature is maximized in the programmable \nregion for a given value of the programming current. This is equivalent to identifying the cell \ngeometry allowing the minimum melting current Im , which is indicative of the programming cur-\nrent. \n \n Fig. 2 shows optimization process, reporting a graphical description of the optimization \nmethodology (Fig. 2a-c) and calculation results (Fig. 2d). Our search for the optimized cell ge-\nometry is performed at equal read performance (Rset) and transversal size of the bottom electrode \n(diameter φ). In fact, on one hand, an upper limit to Rset is given by minimum cell  readout speed, \nsince, for a fixed read voltage Vread. a large Rset would result in a low read current, hence in a \ntypically long read time. On the other hand, the bottom electrode diameter φ is controlled by the \nlithographic capability and the sub-lithographic techniques available at a given technology node \n[13]. In Fig. 2d Therefore, we fix φ=55nm, which is a suitable sub-litho contact size for a 90nm \ntechnology, and, vary Lh and Lc for different values of Rset (from 2 to 5KΩ). Note that, for each \ncurve in the figure, Lc is decreased as Lh is increased in order to obtain the same Rset value. \nClearly, for each curve a minimum Im value, i.e. an optimum cell, exists, which corresponds to an \noptimum balancing of the electrical and thermal resistances of heater and chalgogenide (see Fig. \n2b). On the contrary, unbalanced geometry of the cell, i.e. an excessively large Lc (see Fig. 2a) or  \n  \n \n   \n an excessively large Lh (see Fig. 2c) results in less efficient heating of the active region, hence in \nlarger Im at a given Rset.  \n \n  \n \n a) b) c)a) b) c)\n \n  \n \n d) \nFig. 2: Calculated temperature profiles for different lance cell geometries, all having in common \nthe heater diameter φ and the set resistance Rset. The optimum geometry ensuring minimum pro-\ngramming current is shown (b). \n \n \n Fig. 2d also shows that larger Rset provide lower Im, since increased resistances result in \nlarger heating at the same current. This is further shown in Fig. 3, reporting calculated Im as a \nfunction of Rset in scaled cells, going from the 90 down to the 16nm technology node. Scaling \nresults refer to two different scaling approach: an isotropic approach, where all geometric fea-\ntures (Lc , Lh and φ) are all scaled proportionally to the technology node feature F, and a non-\nisotropic approach, where only φ is reduced and both Lc and Lh are kept unchanged. Clearly, as \ncompared to isotropic, non-isotropic scaling provides a faster decrease of Im, but also an ever \nfaster increase of Rset. Furthermore, a comparison with the PCM requirements from the 2006 In-\nternational Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) reveals that further device optimi-\nzation is needed, which can be possibly achieved by means of material engineering. \n \n \n 10\n3\n \n 10\n4\n \n 10\n5\n \n Rset [Ω]\n10\n \n 1\n \n 10\n2\n \n 10\n3\n \n I m\n [µ\n \n A\n]\n \n Isotropic scaling\nNon-isotropic scaling\nITRS 2006\n \n F=90nm\n \n 16nm\n \n 16nm\n \n 65nm\n \n 45nm\n \n 32nm\n \n 22nm\n \n 90nm\n \n 32nm\n \n  \nFig. 3 Scatter plot for calculated Im and Rset, for technology nodes going from 90 down to 16nm. \nFor comparison, values from the International Semiconductor Roadmap for Semiconductors are \nreported. \n  \n  \n \n   \n Material engineering for programming current reduction \nWe address possible material engineering for improving programming performances by \n \n exploring the impact of electrical and thermal material parameters on Im and Rset. As a reference \ncell, we consider the experimental 90nm cell in Fig. 3, which corresponds to the 3KΩ optimum \ncell in Fig. 2d. Then, with respect to the reference cell, in Fig. 4 we increase material electrical \nresitivities ρh,c by a factor 3 (electrical conductivity decreased by a factor 3) and report the corre-\nspondent value for Im (open triangles). Note that results are reported both when thermal conduc-\ntivities (κh,c) are kept unchanged and when they are decreased of the same factor 3 as for electri-\ncal conductivity, according to the Wiedemann-Franz law (WF). From the figure, the most rele-\nvant Im reduction is obtained by increasing ρh. However, we note that a change in material pa-\nrameters with unchanged geometry affects the balance between heater and chalcogenide electri-\ncal and thermal resistances, which implies that the cell might loose its optimum feature. There-\nfore, a new geometrical optimization could be needed after material engineering (see full circles \nin the figure), showing that cell optimization is indeed a coupled matter of geometry and material \nengineering [13].  \n \n \n   \nFig. 4 Melting current Im for a 90nm technology cell with increased electrical heater and chalco-\ngenide resistivity (ρh and ρc, respectively), calculated either including or not including Wiede-\nmann-Franz law. \n \n \nINSTABILITY OF THE AMORPHOUS STATE  \n \n \n The metastable nature of the amorphous phase represents the most relevant reliability is-\nsue for PCM. Indeed, amorphous GST is subject to structural relaxation (SR), which means that \natoms locally rearrange to reach more stable but still disordered configurations [9, 16], and to \nspontaneous crystallization, which is the phase transition to the ordered poly-crystalline structure \n[18-19]. From the device standpoint, SR appears as a slow but steady increase, or drift, of the \ncell resistance, as a result of the annealing of defects and the consequent drop of Poole-Frenkel \n(PF) conductivity [20]. Fig. 5 shows cell R-t curves, i.e., resistance versus time, on a log-log \nscale, for both a crystalline and an amorphous state. From the figure, the crystalline (set) state is  \n  \n \n   \n stable, while the resistance of the amorphous (reset) state steadily increases with time, following \nthe empirical power-law R=R0(t/t0)\n \n ν, where ν=0.11 is the drift coefficient. \n \n \n 10\n-2\n \n 10\n-1\n \n 10\n0\n \n 10\n1\n \n 10\n2\n \n 10\n3\n \n 10\n4\n \n 10\n5\n \n 10\n6\n \n Time [s]\n \n 10\n3\n \n 10\n4\n \n 10\n5\n \n 10\n6\n \n 10\n7\n \n 10\n8\n \n R\n [Ω\n \n ] ν=0.11\n \n ν<0.01\n \n Reset state\n \n Set state\n \n R=R0(t/t0)\nν\n \n  \n \n  \n \n Fig. 5 Resistance versus time measurement at room temperature for a reset (amorphous) and set \n(crystalline) state, showing the resistance drift of the amorphous state. \n \n \n On the other hand, crystallization of the amorphous phase leads to a resistance drop due \nto the lower resistivity in the crystalline structure. Figs. 4a-c depict the evolution of the pro-\ngrammed amorphous spot with time, as obtained by iso-thermal simulations [17-18], where crys-\ntallization proceeds by nucleation and growth (N/G) of nano-crystallites [21]. On the right hand \nside of the figure, the correspondent R-t curves are reported both for data and calculations at dif-\nferent bake temperatures T=180, 190 and 210°C. For increasing time, resistance displays an ini-\ntial slow decrease as first crystallites build up (a), then rapidly drops as a crystalline percolation \npath is formed (b) and eventually stabilizes to the set value (c). From electrical measure-\nments/calculations in Fig. 4, the cell crystallization time tX can be defined as the time needed for \nR to drop below a certain threshold, say 100 kΩ, when the reset state can be considered to be \nlost. Clearly, tX decreases with temperature, which is captured in simulations by accounting for \nthermal activation of N/G parameters. However, for correct extrapolation of short-time, high-\ntemperature measurements to long-time, low-temperature retention, a physically based model is \nrequired. \n \n \n   \n  \n \n   \n Fig. 6 \u0096 (a)-(c) Calculated phase distribution within an amorphous region (red) during isothermal \nannealing leading to the transformation into the crystalline phase (blue).

Indeed, crystallization speed is determined by nucleation rate IN [m\n-3s-1] and growth \n \n velocity vG [m/s], which both depend exponentially on temperature T (in reported equations, κB \nis Boltzmann constant). The temperature dependence of IN results from two different energy bar-\nriers, namely from the atomic mobility energy barrier, ∆GA, and from the barrier to the formation \nof a stable nucleus, ∆G*. This, in turn, depends on surface energy density, σ, representing an en-\nergetic penalty to the formation of a stable nucleus, and on free Gibbs energy gain per unit vol-\nume, ∆GV, which is zero at melting temperature Τm and increases for decreasing T, as the over-\ncooling term Tm-T increases and the crystalline phase becomes increasingly more stable. For \n∆GV(T) dependence, we used the Sing and Holz approximation in Eq. (4), where ∆Hf  is the dif-\nference of enthalpy between the two phases at melting point [22-24].  \n \n  \n \n  (1) Tk\nGG\n \n NN\nB\n \n *\nA\n \n eII\n∆∆ +\n \n −\n= 0  \n \n  (2) ( )[ ]Tk/GTk\nG\n \n GG\nBVB\n \n A\n \n ee ∆\n∆\n \n −\n−\n \n −= 1vv 0  \n \n  (3) \n2\n \n 3\n \n 3\n \n 16\n \n G\nG*\n \n ∆\nπσ∆ =  \n \n  (4) \n⎥\n \n ⎦\n \n ⎤\n \n ⎢\n \n ⎣\n \n ⎡\n \n +\n−=\n \n TT\n \n T\n \n T\n \n TT\nHG\n \n mm\n \n m\nfV 6\n \n 7∆∆  \n \n  \nTable II. Standard N/G model equations for crystallization.  \n \n \n For reliability extrapolations at low temperatures we need to characterize both nucleation \nand growth in our active material and, as a first step, we extract IN and vG from electrical meas-\nurements. However, it is clear that to extract information on these two distinct parameters, the \ncell crystallization time tX alone is not sufficient, but we need another experimental datum. We \nfind this datum in the average size of crystalline grains at crystallization time, which we extract \nfrom experimental tX distributions. To this purpose, Fig. 7 shows statistical distributions of tX at \ndifferent device temperature. As temperature increases, statistical spread also increases. Since \nreported measurements were performed on the same cell and no aging trend could be observed, \ntX statistics can be ascribed to the percolative nature of conduction in the mixed-phase material, \nand the different spread at different T can be explained with different average size of the crystal-\nlites when cell crystallization occurs. Based on Monte Carlo data-loss calculations, we extracted \naverage crystallites radius rC at experimental temperatures, which are reported in Fig. 7 [18].  \n  \n \n   \n  \nFig. 7 Measured and calculated distributions of retention lifetime, or cell crystallization time tX.  \n \n \n From experimental tX and rC, we then extract N/G parameters, namely, nucleation rate IN \nand growth velocity vG according to an analytical model for PCM cell crystallization [24], i.e.  \n \n  (5) \nΩNX\n \n X\nX I/f\n \n f\nt\n \n 1\n \n 21−\n=  \n \n  (6) \n2\n \n   v XG\nNC\n \n t\nrr += , \n \n where fX  is average crystalline fraction at failure and Ω is average crystallites volume at tX.

On the right, the table reports the most meaningful material parameters used. \n \n \n Parameters in Fig. 8 finally allow to calculate tX as a function of T from experimental to \nlower temperatures. Results are shown in Fig. 9 on an Arrhenius scale, where log(tX) is plotted as \na function of 1/kBT. Results are reported for two different values of σ, i.e. 0.12 J m-2 [24] or 0.04 \nJ m-2 [25], and compared with an Arrhenius extrapolation (straight line in the plot) [8,11-10]. \nIrrespective of σ  value, tX displays an increase with decreasing temperature, which is faster than  \n  \n \n   \n Arrhenius, as a result of non-Arrhenius behavior of IN in Fig. 8. From the application standpoint, \nit is important to compare retention performance of the cell with the standard 10 year data reten-\ntion requirement for any non-volatile memory. From the figure, we can define the 10 year reten-\ntion temperature, T10y, as the maximum device temperature still compliant with such specifica-\ntion. According to our calculations, T10y is between 100 and 120°C, depending on assumed σ  \nvalue, well beyond the 85°C for user applications. \n \n  \nFig. 9 Experimental tX at 180-210°C and calculated tX from experimental to lower temperatures. \nTwo different possible values of σ  were used for calculations. \n \n \n Material engineering for retention improvement \nEven if the retention properties of PCM based on Ge2Sb2Te5 should largely fulfill stan-\n \n dard user applications, material research toward more stable phase-change materials is a timely \ntopic. Indeed, possible extension of PCM to applications operating at higher temperature (e.g. in \nthe fast growing automotive sector),  and possible concerns on retention properties of scaled \namorphous spots of less than 10nm in size [26-29, 30], demand for engineering of high retention \nmaterials. \n \n To this aim, here we address chalcogenide alloys in the ternary system Ge-Sb-Te along \nthe pseudo-binary line (GeTe)x(Sb2Te3)y, as possible alternative phase-change materials. Fig. 10 \nshows the measured crystallization temperature Tx as a function of the stoichiometric parameter \ny/(x+y), as obtained from data by Yamada et al. [31]. Also shown is the band gap EG in the \namorphous phase (data from [9,32]). By moving from Sb2Te3 to GeTe, i.e., for decreasing y/(x + \ny), Tx and EG increase, which suggests that chalcogenide glasses are increasingly strong against \ncrystallization for increasing EG.   \n  \n \n   \n  \n \n \n Fig. 10 Literature data for crystallization temperature TX and energy gap EG for materials in the \npseudo-binary line (GeTe)x(Sb2Te3)y. \n \n \n The relatively high Tx and EG values of materials with high GeTe content suggests that \nsuch materials may be an attractive choice for PCM. Fig. 11a shows calculated cell crystalliza-\ntion time tX as a function of T on an Arrhenius plot for three different materials in the pseudo-\nbinary line (namely, Ge2Sb2Te5, GeSb2Te4 and GeSb4Te7). For each material, the tX-T curve was \ncalculated from available data of TX and EX [31]. Clearly, Ge2Sb2Te5, which has the highest \nGeTe content, displays the largest T10y. Fig. 11b extrapolates these results to other materials on \nthe pseudo-binary line: moving toward GeTe might increase T10y above the typical automotive \nrequired temperature of 125°C. However, we recall that a change of  material would also affect \ncell programming current and speed, as both electrical and thermal conductance will change, as \nwell as high temperature crystallization speed, which is essential for set programming. There-\nfore, the most suitable phase change materials have to be selected and engineered based on a \ncareful trade-off between programming, reliability and technology issues.  \n \n a)  b)  \n \nFig. 11 \u0096 (a) Arrhenius plot of calculated tX for three different materials on the (GeTe)x(Sb2Te3)y \npseudo-binary line.

An electro-thermal model for PCM was employed to investigate optimum cell and ma-\nterial design, stressing the importance of electrical and thermal parameters of materials. Then, \ncrystallization was addressed as the main issue affecting the stability of the programmed amor-\nphous state. Nucleation and growth parameters were extracted for Ge2Sb2Te5 material in our de-\nvices, allowing for estimation of retention capabilities at the 10 year time-scale. Finally, possible \nmaterial engineering was explored for improved retention at temperatures higher than 100°C. \n \n \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n \n This work has been partially supported by the EU within the FP6 project CAMELS (IST-\n3-017406) and by CARIPLO Foundation under Project 2005.124. \n \n  \nREFERENCES \n \n1.

The size of the nanodots was less than 15nm in diameter with 40nm spacing. This method is quite flexible regarding the patterned materials, and can be used on different substrates. The crystallization behavior of small scale phase change nanodot arrays was studied for different materials, such as Ge15Sb85, Ge2Sb2Te5 and Ag and In doped Sb2Te. It was found that the nanodots had higher crystallization temperatures compared to their corresponding blanket films and crystallized over a broader temperature range. \n (Received March 17 2008) \n (Accepted July 25 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t self-assembly;  \n\t nanostructure;  \n\t x-ray diffraction (XRD) \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t \t  How to Cite This Article \n\t\t\t\t \n\t  Link to This Abstract \n\t\t \n\t  Blog This Article \n\t\t \n \n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCopy and paste this link  Highlight all \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\thttp://dx.doi.org/10.1557/PROC-1072-G08-05\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tCitation is provided in standard text and BibTeX formats below.\n\t\t\t\t\t Highlight all \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBibTeX Format\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t@inproceedings{OPL:7989950,\nauthor = {Zhang,Yuan and Raoux,Simone and Krebs,Daniel and Krupp,Leslie E. and Topuria,Teya and Jordan-Sweet,Jean and Caldwell,Marissa and Rice,Philip and Milliron,Delia J. and Wong,H.-S.

,"description":"Phase change nanodot arrays were fabricated using self-assembly diblock copolymer template PS-b-PMMA (polystyrene-poly (methyl-methacrylate)) and studied by time resolved X-ray diffraction. The size of the nanodots was less than 15nm in diameter with 40nm spacing. This method is quite flexible regarding the patterned materials, and can be used on different substrates. The crystallization behavior of small scale phase change nanodot arrays was studied for different materials, such as Ge15Sb85, Ge2Sb2Te5 and Ag and In doped Sb2Te. It was found that the nanodots had higher crystallization temperatures compared to their corresponding blanket films and crystallized over a broader temperature range.","coins":   [

    {"values":"Amorphous LaAlO3 high-k oxide was grown in a molecular beam epitaxy reactor on p-Si(001) using a thin γ-Al2O3 epitaxied buffer layer. Interfaces were free of SiO2 or silicates and remained abrupt despite the high temperature used for annealing, as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed. Electrical measurements performed on as-deposited samples revealed a dielectric constant value close to that of the bulk, small equivalent oxide thickness and low density of interface states. But some negative charges were present, leading to a flat band voltage shift. Post deposition annealing with forming gas can correct this effect."    },

F7, 36 Avenue Guy de Collongue, Ecully, 69134, France \n ABSTRACT \n  \n Amorphous LaAlO3 high-k oxide was grown in a molecular beam epitaxy reactor on p-Si(001) using a thin γ-Al2O3 epitaxied buffer layer. Interfaces were free of SiO2 or silicates and remained abrupt despite the high temperature used for annealing, as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed. Electrical measurements performed on as-deposited samples revealed a dielectric constant value close to that of the bulk, small equivalent oxide thickness and low density of interface states. But some negative charges were present, leading to a flat band voltage shift. Post deposition annealing with forming gas can correct this effect. \n (Received June 29 2008) \n (Accepted  August 27 2008) \n\n Key Words \n \t microelectronics;  \n\t oxide;  \n\t molecular beam

,"description":"Amorphous LaAlO3 high-k oxide was grown in a molecular beam epitaxy reactor on p-Si(001) using a thin γ-Al2O3 epitaxied buffer layer. Interfaces were free of SiO2 or silicates and remained abrupt despite the high temperature used for annealing, as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed. Electrical measurements performed on as-deposited samples revealed a dielectric constant value close to that of the bulk, small equivalent oxide thickness and low density of interface states. But some negative charges were present, leading to a flat band voltage shift. Post deposition annealing with forming gas can correct this effect.","coins":   [

    {"values":"The properties of lanthanum silicate (LaSiOx) gate stacks on GaAs substrates have been examined, comparing different GaAs pretreatments; namely a) as-received, b) HCl-treated, and c) sulphur-treated. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the As 3d, Ga 3d, and Ga 2p binding energy peaks were used to reveal the chemical nature of the stacks. After a 400 6 torr pO2, the LaSiOx chemically reduces the As oxides from the as-received GaAs, while Ga oxide species remain. HCl and S-treated GaAs similarly show no As oxides, and a much smaller degree of Ga oxides than the as-received case. The Ga-S bonding may be responsible for lowering the tendency towards Ga oxidation for the S-treated case. On p-type, Zn-doped GaAs, 3.0 nm lanthanum silicate films produce MOS device EOT values of 2.38 nm, 1.51 nm, and 1.37 nm, on as-received, HCl-treated, and S-treated substrates, respectively. The high EOT for the as-received GaAs corresponds to the thicker Ga oxide and elemental As at the interface.  The decreases in both Ga oxide and elemental As at the interface of the S-treated stack appears to be related to it having the lowest EOT devices."    },
