Their compromise resulted in the\noldest recorded private land grant in Texas. The grant, recorded in the\nGeneral Land Office, consisted of a total of fifteen leagues and seven labores\nin present-day Karnes and Wilson counties, of which eleven leagues and two\nlabores went to Menchaca and four leagues and five labores to Hernández. It is\npossible that this was the site of the first ranch in Texas. Hernández's ranch\nheadquarters was in the same locale as Fuerte de Santa Cruz del Cíbolo. \n \n1836 - Mexican forces under General Santa Anna captured Thompson's Ferry, on\nthe Brazos River between San Felipe and Fort Bend. As Sam Houston's army\nretreated eastward, a rear-guard under Moseley Baker at San Felipe and Wyly\nMartin at Fort Bend sought to prevent the Mexicans from crossing the Brazos.\nAt Thompson's Ferry on April 12, Mexican colonel Juan N. Almonte hailed the\nferryman, who was on the east bank. Probably thinking that Almonte was a\ncountryman who had been left behind during the retreat, the ferryman poled the\nferry across to the west bank. Santa Anna and his staff, who had been hiding\nin nearby bushes, sprang out and captured the ferry. By this means the Mexican\nCentralists accomplished a bloodless crossing of the Brazos. The Texan forces\nat Fort Bend and San Felipe were forced to abandon their defenses and join the\nrest of Houston's army in retreat. But the Mexicans make a huge tactical\nerror. 1,500 troops and four cannons are will remain to guard the ferry. Had\nthey received word of Santa Anna's defeat just two days march ahead of them,\nthey could easily have stolen victory from the Texans. \n \n1844 - An annexation treaty was completed on April 12, 1844, and signed by\nSecretary of State John C. Calhoun, Isaac Van Zandt, and Van Zandt's\nassistant, J. Pinckney Henderson. President Sam Houston favored a \"diplomatic\nact,\" but Anson Jones, the president elect, balked. Jones wanted annexation\nand thought that the threat of an alignment with England, connected with the\ncotton trade, was the key to achieving it. In June 1844 the United States\nSenate voted thirty-five to sixteen to reject the treaty. \n \n1879 - Wheeler County became the first organized county in the Texas\nPanhandle. The Kiowas and Comanches, who displaced the earlier Apache peoples\naround 1700, dominated the area until the mid-1870s. By that time buffalo\nhunters had already established a settlement, called Hidetown or Sweetwater,\nin the area. The U.S. Army established Fort Elliott near Hidetown in 1875, and\nthe first post office in the Panhandle opened there in 1878. The legislature\nestablished Wheeler County, named for Royal T. Wheeler, in 1876. Three years\nlater, the residents of the area petitioned for county organization, which\nbecame official on April 12. The small camp of Sweetwater became the first\ncounty seat; it was renamed Mobeetie in 1880. \n \n1919 - Broadway actress Ann Miller was born in Chireno (Nacogdoches Co).\nMiller stared in 40 movies and made numerous television shows. She had been a\ntap dancer since she was a young child. It was Ann who discovered Lucille Ball\nwhile visiting a San Francisco nightclub. Known as the \"Queen of Tap\", Ann\nMiller had her legs insured by RKO pictures for $1,000,000. She died in 2004\nat the age of 80. \n \n1927 - An F5 tornado touched down just northwest of Rocksprings, and began the\nviolent march into the small town in the Western Hill Country. The tornado\ndestroyed 235 of Rockspring's 247 buildings and killed 74 people, almost 1/3\nof the population. Clearing Rocksprings, it continued southeastward for\nanother estimated 50 miles. With the death toll at 74 dead and 205 injured,\nthe Rocksprings tornado is to date, the third deadliest tornado in Texas\nhistory, behind the Waco tornado of 1953, and Goliad of 1902. \n \n1987 - The Daughters of the Republic of Texas dedicated a bronze and marble\nplaque at the site where the original international boundary marker between\nthe United States and the Republic of Texas still stands. \n \n1991 - Following the Gulf War, the Department of Defense labeled Fort Hood a\ntop fighting installation and stationed 12,000 additional troops there. In\nDecember 1992 the Fifth Infantry Division was inactivated and redesignated the\nSecond Armored Division.\n\n","parent_id":"77129","link":"http://www.texaschlforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=974372#p974372","item_id":"974372","thread_id":"77129"},

Some ring true, but some are\nhauled out from the nether regions. \n \nThe \"Department of Precrime.\" If we postulate that humans do stupid shit, we\ncan posit that those who don't do stupid shit may need guns against those who\ndo do stupid shit. \n \nAs senorgrand noted last year, if the .gov puts a stigma on things like\nviolent tendencies, then people will not seek help for fear of some kind of\nrestriction or confiscation. This is bad. Here is that thread: \n \n[viewtopic.php?f=52&t=29425&p=409163&hilit=mental+health#p409163](http://www.t\nheliberalgunclub.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=52&t=29425&p=409163&hilit=mental+h\nealth#p409163) \n \nIt is better to accept that humans may do stupid shit. \n \n\n**Quote:**\n\n“With gun violence, you need two things: dangerous people and guns,” he said.\n“In this country, we can’t limit gun ownership, so we have to focus more on\ndangerous people, and that’s complicated.” Current criteria for restricting\nspecific individuals’ gun ownership is both too broad and too narrow, he said,\nidentifying too many who aren’t violent and not enough of those who are. But\nthree states have come up with ways to address the issue. Connecticut and\nIndiana have laws allowing preemptive seizure of firearms – subject to due\nprocess – from high-risk individuals, and California recently enacted a “gun\nviolence restraining order,” building on the existing system of restraining\norders.\n\n \nlink: \n \n[http://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/ ...\n-violence/](http://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2015/04/08/seize-guns-from-\nangry-people-and-reduce-firearm-violence/) \n \nIf we assume that some people could benefit from seeking treatment without\nfear of gun confiscation, then we should develop a better way of dealing with\nthat person's guns. I suggest that three local gun stores around the person in\nquestion be requested to submit bids to store this person's guns while the\nperson seeks treatment--the patient could select which ever one was\nappropriate. The doctor would sign off when treatment either is complete or\nhas failed, when the person would either get the guns back or have them\nconfiscated or transferred to another owner. \n \nMental health is a real thing. If we don't get out in front of it, more states\nwill pass confiscatory laws; we totally know that \"mental health\" is one of\nthe most controversial and misunderstood categories of well being. Either we\ndefine it or it will be defined for us, and we'll see unnecessary troubles and\nconfiscations. \n \nCDFingers\n\n \n_________________ \nAin't no time to hate; barely time to wait. \nWhat I want to know is, 'where does the time go?'\n\n","thread_id":"31903","link":"http://www.theliberalgunclub.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=452624#p452624","item_id":"452624"},

Some materials get a patina on them ( some \"age\" more than others, or\nfaster ) that wasn't present when made. A lot of times when it was made it was\nsolid black. Over time it changes to the colors that we see today. \n \nFt. Payne chert for example is black with white inclusions if you get it out\nof the ground today. Points that are 7000 years old are now brown and bright\nwhite. If you find one that is broken you will see that the inside is still\nblack. \n \nAlso a lot of cherts where heat treated. This makes the material easier to\nwork but also brings out color. All of these change with age. \n \nBut no doubt they favored \"pretty\" rocks.
