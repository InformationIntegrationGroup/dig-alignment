At NO time have I mentioned that OTHER items (barrels, other gun parts, etc) get cheaper. There is a reason for this. The more I order Glock slides from my supplier, the CHEAPER I GET THEM. I cannot get cheap gun parts in general, I charge roughly 100% of the list price and a little bit for shipping (depending on the item). This is the LOWEST price I will offer to you, if you&#039;re in search of a bulky item (eg. an AR upper) or a really expensive item (eg. thermal optics), the price on your end WILL BE HIGHER.So to recap:If you buy a TON of Glock slides, there is a price break on successive ordersIf you buy a TON of Glock barrels, AR/AK parts, Anything OTHER THAN a GLOCK SLIDE, there IS NO BREAKK? I hope this helps. &lt;3 &amp; Kisses  :-* ps. Price breaks on other items will always be considered depending on the country I&#039;m shipping to, the item(s) ordered, and the status of our relationship.

Helped me along the way of choosing a product, and was very, very supportive during the whole deal.Price for product: 8/10&#160; &#160;Price was very fair. Would have even bought it for a bit more.Shipping: 10/10&#160; &#160; The package was packed very securely, and there was no chance of the item being damaged. Shipping was really, really fast too.Item: 9/10Booted the machine up to see if the specs were as stated, and they were. Item is in very good condition. 3 or 4 scratches and so, but hey, who cares for that price?Overall experience: 9.5This vendor is awesome, he (or she as I read somewhere?) is very honest and will help you a lot along the way. Will definitely buy again. Thank you, Alexandrea!
