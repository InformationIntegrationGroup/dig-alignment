For example handguns are just fine, shotguns, rifles, machine guns, small guns, big guns, old guns and new guns. Even if you want to submit a review on a paintball gun, that’s okay.\nSoon there will be guidelines on what information you should submit and your review. Please don’t feel like you have to be a professional broadcaster to submit a good review. Some of the best reviews on firearms are from the people who actually use them and carry them.

      "text": "Comments\nIt can be hard to keep your finances organized – but thankfully, smartphones can help us keep track of our money no matter where we are. But finding the right programs can be overwhelming. There are many apps out there that make it easy to spend money (we’re looking at you Gilt), but what about managing it?\nHere, we investigate some of the best smartphone apps for managing your money and keeping your finances in order. From calculating traveling expenses to splitting the check with friends, this list has all the apps you need to track your cash flow.\nManaging Daily Expense. There are a number of great apps that can help you track daily living expenses. At the top of our list for this is Mint . Mint pulls all your financial information and puts it all in one place so you can easily track your finances. Ziplist is another app for the daily grind.Ziplist is the ultimate in grocery shopping apps. Studies continually show that you spend less money when you go to the grocery store with a list and if your list is in your smartphone you really have no excuses for not consulting it. Ziplist helps track your grocery spending and has a number of cool features, like a built-in bar code so you can add to your list in seconds.\nTracking Payments. Manilla is an app on a mission to make sure you never have a late bill payment. Manilla will send you reminders about when a bill is due and will also store important financial documents. In addition to syncing with over 3,500 businesses, Manilla also lets you add personalized expenses like a dog walker or babysitter.\nPaying Back Friends. Venmo makes it easy to pay back friends for things like dinner or movie tickets and can help split utilities and coordinate rent payments among roommates. Money is sent between app users and then users can easily cash out their balances at the bank. Tricount is another useful app that does a similar thing to Venmo, only for group users. This makes it easy to pay for things like group vacations where a number of people may be splitting expenses like car rentals and hotel stays.\n \nOur Tweets\nHey, textPlussers!

I had read that they were offering Easter egg coloring.\nWe ordered lunch by the fireplace, and then L went outside to color the eggs.\nBTW, do those napkins look familiar? I use the same for our living room curtains .\nThinking hard about what to draw on the egg with the wax pen. He had so much fun.\nOur lunch arrived, and while I was enjoying my beet salad with hazelnuts, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michale Douglas sat down next to me, with their two kids.\nThey had a lot of fun together and laughed a lot.

He picked up the 500th win of his coaching career earlier this season and Nixa’s 72-49 win at Republic March 6, for the Class 5 District 12 title, is his eighth district crown with the Eagles. But don’t think for a second\nUpdated: March 07, 2015 - 4:26 am\nThere were hugs and tears and looks of disbelief after Nixa lost to No. 3 Republic 60-46 in the Class 5 District 12 championship game. But it wasn’t because of the score.\nUpdated: March 05, 2015 - 11:26 pm\nSurvive and advance is the mantra in March and the Nixa Eagles did both, albeit without style points, in a 55-30 Class 5 District 12 semifinal win over Willard March 5.\nUpdated: March 04, 2015 - 5:07 am\nIt may not have been like such a big deal at first, just a chat between teammates.\nThe big snow that hit southwest Missouri Feb. 28 has scrambled the Class 5 district basketball tournaments scheduled to start that day. Here are the updated schedules for both of Christian County’s big schools.\nPosted: February 28, 2015\nIf you braved the elements Feb. 17, you saw a heck of a boys’ basketball game between the host Ozark Tigers and visiting Nixa Eagles. It was a Tuesday night, which typically means boys basketball here in the Ozarks. But, thanks to a postponement, the opening game was a showdown between the Nixa Lady Eagles and Ozark Lady Tigers.\nAddress: 123 Sherman Way, Ste. 101Mailing address: P.O.
