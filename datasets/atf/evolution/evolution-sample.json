The gun you all know and love from dozens of nazi-movies and the gun that borrowed its mechanical workings to the Beretta 92.   All around I consider this gun to be the next best thing to a Glock, with even better accuracy and concealability.   It is a relatively light and compact weapon for this caliber and can be carried concealed pretty well.   The grip is designed very ergonomical and slim and fits the hand like a glove, much better than with most modern high-cap guns. This also adds to increased accuracy when shooting.   Easy to modifiy for supressor use because of the pencil barrel.   The P38 is known for exceptional precision and reliability.   A premium collectors piece but also a reliable self defense weapon.   Together with hollowpoint ammunition from my shop you have a very accurate weapon-system for short distance self-defense. A good shooter can hit with it far further than the standard 50m.   __________________________________________  __________________________________________    This particular gun is a post war model, build for the civilian market, probably made during the 1960&acute;s-1980&acute;s. The Bundeswehr designation for the gun was &quot;P1&quot;, but all of them were technically mostly identical. All these have an aluminum frame instead of the all steel frame of the WWII P38, making the gun sigificantly lighter.  (gun weighs just under 890 grams with a full magazine, for comparison: an FN-Hi-Power will weigh over 1,2 kg)   It is in overall good condition and has been double checked for flawless function and test fired sucessfully. All serials etc. are intact, thats why there are paper sheets on the photo.   This gun has a very smooth and &quot;rock- solid&quot; feel to it, is mechanically in top condition, barrel is as good as new.   It is also surprisingly lightweight, at least for me personal. You can feel this is a solid peace of german precision-engineering.   I can guarantee that this gun has never been used in any crime of any sort.    Note: The magazine it came with is defective, I will get another magazine for it that works during the next week.    ____________________________________________  ____________________________________________     Specifications:   Weight: 800 g (1 lb 12 oz)  Length: 216 mm (8.5 in)  Barrel length: 125 mm (4.9 in)  Cartridge: 9&times;19mm Parabellum  Action: Short recoil, locked breech  Muzzle velocity: 365 m/s (1,200 ft/s)  Effective firing range: Sights set for 50 m (55 yd)  Feed system: 8-round detachable single-stack magazine ( possible is + 1 in the chamber)  ", "ships_from": "Germany", "title": "Walther P38 Pistol - 9x19 mm Luger - &quot;ZimmerFlak&quot;", "url": "http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listings/50969-2015-01-16", "price": "BTC 10.8707", "ships_to": "Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom", "user_percent": "100.0%", "user_level": "1", "user_number": "17", "stock": "Currently unavailable."}, {"username": "ErichHartmann", "description": "=&gt; Shipping safely from Germany &lt;=   ------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------    Expanding self defense ammunition, for maximum lethality.
