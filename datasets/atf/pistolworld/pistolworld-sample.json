        "content": "Is anyone else astonished at these numbers?<br /><br />&quot;Over the last 20 years, the U.S. has been slowly phasing out economic aid to Israel and gradually replacing it with increased military aid. Beginning in 2007, the U.S. has increased military aid by $150 million each year. By FY2012, we will be sending Israel $3.09 billion a year (or an average of $8.5 million a day) and will continue to provide military aid at that level through 2018. U.S. tax dollars are subsidizing one of the most powerful foreign militaries. According to the CRS report, “[current U.S. military aid] grants to Israel represent 18.2% of the overall Israeli defense budget.” <br /><br />From another website I learned that the U.S. sends $600 million to Palestine. Why?<br />You agree?",

        "content": "Hello<br />Deer season Opened here in East Tennessee Yesterday morning, so I decided to take along my Hamilton Bowen 16-4 Revolver that had been modified to the new Federal .327 Magnum Caliber. I had been recently hand loading some rounds using brass donated by forum member David Ballantyne {Thank's Dave} and worked up a very Potent load using Accurate Arms #7 Powder along with a Sierra 90 Grain Copper Jacketed Hollow point and CCI-550 Magnum Powder. This Load showed to group the size of a dime on on the 20 Yard Line at my Range Late Thursday afternoon, so I decided to use it hunting.<br /><br /><br /><br />I had my Marlin 336 Lever rifle chambered in .35 Rem. Caliber as well. I entered the woods just before daylight and Positioned myself about 30 Yards off a main Deer run. I had not seen a Deer and about Quarter to Eight, I began to wonder if the Presence of a Big Wild Cat had spoiled my chances of seeing any Bucks ? My Buddy who owns the land we hunt had warned me he had seen a Huge wild Cat the week before in his back yard about Noon. It apparently was stalking his House Cat's and he Feared it would attack them. I assured him, if I should see it in the woods he would have no more worries.<br /><br /><br />At 5 Minutes to Eight, I heard a small twig snap behind me. I looked up that way, and there was This Big Bobcat standing there Looking at me. I slowly raised my revolver that was in my lap and took aim. I was shaking fiercely, so I had to tell myself this was the chance of a life time shot, and to calm down. I knew the gun and load would do the Job if I did mine. I gently squeezed the trigger and the cat fell over Instantly.<br /><br /><br />I then called my Son in law who was hunting with me on his First Deer hunt and told him to get up to where I was sitting. He asked if I had shot a buck, and I told him I had killed that Big Bobcat. He did not believe me, but Joined me shortly. I dragged it out of the brush I had shot him in, and noticed the slug entered his left chest cavity and exited out his right rib cage. When I Gutted him out It had hit his Heart and right Lung before exiting. This cat weighed about 50 pounds and his stomach was the size of a Youth Football in size filled with what appeared to be fresh rabbit. He never made a sound nor moved after I shot him, so I guess it is safe to say the .327 Magnum more than did it's Job, and this may make the Non Belivers of this round take notice of how potent it really is. Before we left the woods, We Paced it off from where I shot this cat from and it was a true 35 Yard shot. I am still in Awe that I Bagged this animal and will have a Full Mount done of him.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v258/hammerdown-7/Kitty-Kitty001.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br /><br /><br /><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v258/hammerdown-7/Kitty-Kitty002.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />",

        "content": "Hello<br />I finally got my Wild Cat Mount back yesterday after a 10 Month wait. I had asked the Taxidermist to mount him in a Full action Pose of attack mode. I will eventually add a large Fox squirrel or Rabbit between his paws when I find the right donor. The Taxidermist shared with me that this was the largest Wild Cat he had ever seen or mounted being 41-1/2&quot; in length, and feels it may very well be a Tennessee State record due to it's size Proportion. He said that he had in the past mounted well over 200 cats from all over the United states, but this one was the biggest that he had ever seen or mounted. He had to order Two-forms to mount him on due to his size. He also commented on his eye color as he said most that he had mounted in the past were more brown in color and these eyes were custom ordered from England as they are of much higher quality than those offered in the United states and they seem to follow you across the room. The Mount adjusts up or down by taking down Two 1/2&quot; Nuts located under the base, and there is Two 3/8&quot; steel rods inside the Mold to stiffen the Pose. He will reside in our living room on a custom built corner shelf<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v258/hammerdown-7/BobCat023.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br /><br /><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v258/hammerdown-7/BobCat022.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br /><br /><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v258/hammerdown-7/BobCat018.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br /><br /><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v258/hammerdown-7/BobCat015.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br /><br /><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v258/hammerdown-7/BobCat002.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />",

        "content": "Hi - first post to this forum. <br /> <br />I love to shoot, but find myself pulling my glasses out about 1/2&quot; and looking through the bottom of the lens just to get a somewhat clear view of both the pistol sights and the target. I am near sighted, with astigmatism, and wear progressive lenses. <br /> <br />I have heard of having lenses cut especially for shooting for people like me, but all of the optometrists I have talked to seem to look at me like I have two heads when I explain my problem and aren't helpful. <br /> <br />At my age (55) I don't really mind looking sort of goofy with my glasses pulled out and my head tilted up so I can see through the bottom of the lens, but it doesn't really lend itself to comfortable or consistent shooting. When I do occasionally get a good view I do well, but most of the time I'm sort of guessing at how well the sights are aligned. <br /> <br />I would like to try some competitive shooting, but this is holding me back from trying. Has anyone else had this problem, and found a solution? <br /> <br />Thanks for a great site, <br /> <br />Randy",

He bumped up the prescription on the distance vision enough to make it better not perfect but better. Also, he does not except the insurance that I have but I do not mind having to pay out of pocket as he is really a great doctor. You might need to look for a doctor that is a shooter or really understands what you are looking for. Hope this helps",

To begin with, with out glass's on a pistol you focus on the front sight and center mass of the target. <br />Now you are older with glasses, so you need the bi-tri that lets you use the computer screen to easly focus on. I have tri-focals and its this mid range that I use for pistol shooting at 25 yds. Focus on the front sight and hold center mass on the target. Otherwise get a scope or a red dot for more accurate shooting. <br />Jim",

I did my initial range time with a law enforcement pistol instructor trading off some fishing tackle for lessons. He likes to fish and I needed some help so it was a win/win. <br /><br />I'm 60 years young and wear progressive lenses in my glasses. My problem is getting a clear view of the pistol sights more than the target. After my first 500 rounds I was doing OK, but knew I was a better shot than the scores I was shooting. I used to shoot handguns and shotguns years back and was quite proficient. I was at the range alone one evening and after shooting 250 rounds I decided to take my glasses off for the last 50 and the difference was remarkable. Sure, the target was more blurry, but the sights were crystal clear and I shot extremely well. However, shooting without my glasses is not practical, especially if I ever find myself in a real world self defense situation. I sure can't be tossing my glasses off. <br /><br />I tried my optometrist and was told there wasn't much that could be done, although she did back off on the strength of the close up portion of the progressives. Still, on the range I find myself craning my neck, moving my head around, pushing and pulling the pistol closer or farther away from my face all in a vain effort to get and hold a clear sight picture with my glasses on. It's very frustrating. I am not sure what the answer is, but it might just be a laser sight. I really hate to resort to that. Anyone else have suggestions?",

Only half found the 8x8&quot; target paper. Then I started concentrating on seeing just the front sight and did much better. I can still make out the dark center area where the bulls eye is but it is badly blurred. But enough shots came close to it so I felt I did okay. A few days later I tried again with a .40SW and did fairly decently. I won't win any contests unless it is against all shooters over 65 - then there's a chance. But that leaves room for improvement. I did find one trick that helps when I start looking at the target. I point the gun initially high over the target (finger off the trigger, of course) and then concentrate on the front sight as I lower the gun down to the target. I stop the gun when the front sight is on the blurry bullseye and squeeze off the shot.",

T.A. S. has some interesting sights as well as Jeff at Occluder Sight. Ive also gone to reloading with 200-gn lswc bullets instead of 230-gn, with a slightly lighter powder charge.This has reduced recoil and my follow up shots are much better.

However, shooting without my glasses is not practical, especially if I ever find myself in a real world self defense situation. I sure can't be tossing my glasses off.",

        "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"><br />This has come Directly from Magnum Research's Website, Hopefully You will find it interesting!<br /><br />Remember to always practice good gun safety and wear eye and ear protection while shooting. We always suggest wearing a good Magnum Research hat, too, for a little extra protection (plus they look good). <br /><br />Always make sure your pistol is unloaded before you perform any maintenance. And go through your owner's manual every once in a while. There are some good tips on cleaning and taking care of your pistol right in the manual that we send out with every new pistol. <br /><br />What comes with my new Baby Eagle pistol?<br />The firearm itself, one magazine, warranty card and owner's manual.

American Eagle, Winchester, Remington, FMC, Hornady, UMC). We do not recommend the use of these ammunitions: Wolf (lacquered steel cases, poor QC) and Sellier &amp; Bellot (very &quot;dirty&quot; ammunition). <br /><br />Can I shoot +P or +P+ in by Baby Eagle pistol?<br />No, the pistol is not designed for this type of ammunition.<br /><br />Can I shoot reloads in my Baby Eagle pistol?<br />I am sorry we do not offer any reloading information since we do not recommend reloading in any of our products. Any use of reloads (problems caused by them) will void the warranty on any MRI product. However, if you are going to reload we suggest you strictly follow all safe reloading information in a good up to date reloading manual. <br /><br />What holsters are available for my Baby Eagle pistol?<br />Uncle Mikes does carry several styles of cordura holsters (size #15 or #16 for the BABY Eagle pistols) and magazine pouches; visit their web site at <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.uncle-mikes.com\">www.uncle-mikes.com</a><!-- w -->).

Please contact them directly at 1-800-235-2162 or <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.laserdevices.com\">www.laserdevices.com</a><!-- w -->. <br /><br />Is there a speed loader for my Baby Eagle magazine?<br />A company called ADCO makes a magazine loader product called the &quot;superthumb&quot;, contact them directly at 1-781-935-1799. <br /><br />What finish is recommended on my Baby Eagle pistol (steel models) for damp conditions?<br />It depends on the price you are willing to pay, on the low dollar end it would be the Matte Chrome or Brushed Chrome and on the high dollar end either of the Titaniums. Please do note that any finish can rust including stainless steel, but with proper periodic maintenance and cleaning after each use you should not have any problems. <br /><br />Can I send in my new or used Baby Eagle pistol (steel pistols only) to be custom finished in one of the finishes you offer? <br />Yes, you can send your Baby Eagle pistol to us for a custom shop finish (takes approximately 90-120 days):<br /><br />Magnum Research, Inc.<br />Attn: Custom Shop <br />7110 University Avenue NE<br />Minneapolis, MN 55432<br /><br />Please include a cover letter stating what you would like done to your pistol, your billing address, a ship-to address (for firearms; this needs to be a business address/or your dealer's address; since we no longer ship a firearm back to a residential address for your safety and ours), a daytime phone number (in case we have any questions), or you may include a copy of this email.

        "content": "I have had this happen with my Springfield Ultra Carry when carrying IWB as it has a slightly larger safety than normal and would catch on my T-shirt or skin while moving around. I found that I had to change the position of the gun to lessen this occurance. I moved it behind the hip but depending on body shape you might find a different position to be better. I also found that an IWB holster that had a sweat shield between me and the gun reduced this occurance to nothing as did a switch to a belt carry holster. Ambidextrious safeties are renowned for this happening and is one reason I don't use them. You could also switch to a thinner safety but that might make it harder to disengage under stress.",

        "content": "This is a common and well known \"problem\" with extended safeties like on your buddy's and your former guns. The gun manufacturers know this but the buying public insists on this feature as their action shooting heroes have this feature and the magazine pundits rave about it. The only cures are as mentioned above, replace the thumb safety with a less obtrusive one or get a holster that protects the safety from catching on the body or clothing. After all, specialized equipment is not made to be used with run of the mill accessories. <br />The original IWB holster for my Ultra Carry was a plain suede Bianchi IWB with single belt clip. This regularly allowed the safety to disengage as provided little more than a pocket for the gun to ride in. The single clip also let the gun swivel a fair bit as I moved about which didn't help matters either. A switch to an Uncle Mike's equivalent never released the safety as it covered the whole side of the gun but it was a high ride model and the single clip had troubles staying on the belt. That was a different problem. A switch to a Galco USA (Ultimate Second Amendment) was better as it rode lower but still it had a single belt clip and no sweat guard which allowed the safety to disengage twice in in one year that I recall. I finally ponied up the money and bought a Tucker \"The Answer\". This is the style of holster these guns (excluding ami-safety) were made to be carried in. The dual clips hold the holster and gun in one place to help prevent safety disengagement and the sweat shield between the body and the whole gun is extra protection. A less expensive model by Crossbreed is available which is very similar and I'm sure there are others. <br />For outside waistband carry, I have had a problem with only one holster and that was a Fobus paddle. Not surprisingly it does not fully enclose the pistol nor the safety ending about at the front of the grip. It also angles the gun towards the body slightly which increases the odds of an inadvertant release. All my other belt holsters have a retention strap which protects the safety very well. Hope this all helps your buddy with his present gun.",

As for the safety, the manufacturers would like to put on a slimmer one but buyers seeing this is the \"In\" thing on the combat circuits demand an extended safety so the manufacturers put it on. Writers gush over how great it is and how one won't fumble disengaging it under stress increasing demand. I don't think most writers carry that much and have little idea how different the street is from the range. Those whose views I trust point out the benefit/risks of various \"improvements\" and what their purpose really is. It takes a bit of study to determine what constitutes a good carry gun for an individual, buying a gun named \"The Best Gosh Darndest Carry Gun\" is not necessarily it.

They are somewhat easy to shoot, just need a little practice with the trigger (nice, quick response), and sight/target acquisition. The 9mm has light recoil, affordable, and ammo is usually in stock at stores. Also, the KSR9 is capable of shooting personal defense rounds (147gr. +P).<br /><br />My advice is to clean your KSR9 very well (including the striker) prior to firing. There are several great cleaning instruction and review videos on YouTube. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />",

The gun will be used basically for recreational shooting at the range. The p93 has been the hardest for me to find, but when I do it is at a very good price about 250. I am a college student so that is very appealing. That being said I noticed a very big drop in price on the XD going in my area for about 300-400. The IAC is also about 300. Any advice is welcome. Because I am in school shooting the guns at the moment to test them is not possible this will be a purchase done this summer.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Hawkeye",

        "content": "I am very happy to see you ruled out the IAC, a knockoff at that price point would be a very low quality gun which, in my experience, is an expensive pain to keep running and nearly impossible to foist off on someone else when you finally get tired of running over He!! trying to get parts or repairs. <br />I further second, thid, or whatever the idea of getting a 9mm rather than a 40 S&amp;W or 45 ACP. Ammo cost is much lower for the 9mm with Wal-Mart just recently having them at $9.50/box of 50 for Federal and Cabela's has or had them last weekend at $9 for Fiocchi. Even now Wal-Mart has the Federals at $10.50/box which is still better than the $14/box for the 40 and $16 for the 45. I have stocked up on the 9mm as I plan on buying one for a practice gun rather than the 40 S&amp;W and 45 ACP I carry on and off duty. Even though I reload and can save quite a bit over store bought, the 9mm is still noticeably cheaper either from the store or when rolling my own. Saving nearly 1/3 is a real savings and just allows me to shoot that much more for the same cost. <br />The 9mm is also a good centerfire starter gun as the recoilis pretty mild. That allows one to concentrate more on their form rather than the recoil which only helps one to learn proper technique quicker. <br />As much as I like the XD (it is my choice as a weapon for both on and off duty) I would look strongly at a model that has a 22 LR conversion kit available. As cheap and easy to shoot as a 9mm is, the 22LR has it beat in spades. The greatly reduced cost and recoil of the 22 is a great help in learning to shoot well and one will very quickly see the price of slide paid back in ammo costs. 500 rounds of 22 LR will run about $20 at most while that amount of money will get 100 rounds of 9mm at best. In about 3-4 trips to the store, that $80 you save between 500 rounds of 22 LR and 9mm will pay for the slide. I did that with a 1911 and liked it so much I am sorry I did not choose a different gun for my duty weapon.",

        "content": "This Information Was Again Taken Right off their Website @ <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"Http://www.Magnumresearch.com\">Http://www.Magnumresearch.com</a><!-- m --><span style=\"font-weight: bold\"><br /><br />What comes with my new Desert Eagle pistol?<br />The firearm itself, one magazine, warranty card, owner's manual and the 5-in-1 universal cleaning tool. The extra slot(s) can be used for spare magazine, spare 10&quot; barrel or cleaning items. <br /><br />What if I lost my owner's manual?<br />You can download a copy of the owner's manual or order one from our store.<br /><br /><br /> Desert Eagle Pistol owner's manual download <br />or <br /> Order a hard copy from our store. <br /><br /><br />What is the warranty on my new Desert Eagle pistol?<br />One-year parts and labor. <br /><br />The spent case hits me in the forehead, why?<br />Your shooting (grip) technique is allowing the pistol to move back and torque to the left causing ejected brass to come back at you. Use a firm grip and do not allow the pistol to torque (turn) left under recoil.<br />How to Shoot<br /><br />You can also add Hogue soft rubber grips with or without finger-grooves or have your barrel MagNaPorted, which will improve your grip and reduce felt recoil. <br /><br />Can my Desert Eagle pistol be ported?<br />Yes, we suggest a company called MagNaPort International. Please contact them directly if you would like to have your pistol/revolver done at 1-586-469-6727, <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.magnaport.com\">www.magnaport.com</a><!-- w -->. <br /><br />What ammunition is recommended for use in my Desert Eagle pistol?<br />DEP Suggested Ammunition<br />Remember that ammunition is very important with the Desert Eagle pistol. Defective ammunition will keep you from chambering. Check the type of ammunition you are using. If ammunition is underpowered it will not reliably cycle the action of your Desert Eagle. Shooting lead or full-metal jacket with an open lead base will not only foul the recoil spring assembly crosspiece and the rods, but it will also carbon and lead-foul the piston and solder it to the barrel. You should stay with good, semi-jacketed ammunition. We do suggest trying as many commercial, manufactured, semi-jacketed Magnum cartridges as possible and see which one works the best for you and your pistol. <br /><br />Can I shoot reloads in my Desert Eagle pistol?<br />I am sorry we do not offer any reloading information since we do not recommend reloading in any of our products. Any use of reloads (problems caused by them) void the warranty on any MRI product. However, if you are going to reload we suggest you strictly follow all safe reloading information in a good up to date reloading manual. <br /><br />Why can I not see the rifling in my barrel?<br />The Desert Eagle features the innovative polygon rifling system. To the uniformed eye used to seeing the sharp edges of the land and grooves of typical rifling, the Desert Eagle pistols bore does look almost smooth and featureless. The polygonal rifling reduces gas leakage and bullet distortion and promotes higher velocity; longer bore life and easier cleaning. Accuracy is typically as good or better than conventional rifling, which is probably why many Desert Eagle owners claim that it is the most accurate pistol they've ever shot. <br /><br />What does my Desert Eagle pistol weigh?<br />With an empty magazine the Mark XIX pistols weigh approximately 4lbs. 6.2 oz.<br /><br />My Desert Eagle pistol will not chamber or my bolt does not close fully, why is this?<br />The first thing is being sure your pistol is unloaded. The main reason this may happen is your pistol is dirty and needs to be cleaned; a dirty pistol will affect the chambering, extraction and the overall performance of the gun. Inspect the chamber, clean it with a bore brush (we use a bronze brush) and solvent, and lightly oil it with a patch. Next the recoil spring assembly gets lead and carbon-fouled that it may not let the bolt shut. All you need to do with the recoil spring assembly is fieldstrip it and clean it, oil it, and be sure to properly assemble it. Use your 5-in-1 tool to remove the firing pin, remove the bolt assembly and inspect the bolt - basically just clean your bolt assembly, clean your firing pin, review your manual and reassemble the pistol. <br /><br />Another problem is a lot of people that shoot wheel guns and different types of pistols have a tendency to limp-wrist. They have to in order to take up recoil of the gun itself. With the Desert Eagle pistol, you can't. You have to take a good two-handed grip to assure a clean, crisp snapping action of the slide forward and back. If you are limp-wristing, it takes ups the inertia of the slide, it won't come all the way back, and the action doesn't cycle properly.<br />How to Shoot <br /><br />How do I use the 5-in-1 tool universal cleaning tool for my Desert Eagle pistol?<br /><br />The Reamer Head - used to clean lead deposits from the gas cylinder. Remove barrel from pistol, place reamer head in cylinder and work back and forth to remove lead deposit. <br /><br />The Disassembly Tool on the handle has four uses: <br />Firing Pin Tool - used to push the firing pin to allow removal of firing pin stop to allow removal of firing pin. <br />Bolt Guide Pin Tool - used to pull the bolt guide pin from the bottom of the slide to remove bolt from slide. Note: Firing pin must be removed first. <br />Grip Pin Tool - used to push in grip pin to allow removal of handgrips. <br />Magazine Disassembly Tool - used to push in the magazine base catch pin on the bottom of the magazine to allow removal of base and disassembly of magazine. (Warning: Wear safety glasses when disassembling the magazine - the magazine spring is under tension and could cause serious eye injury if released suddenly.) <br />How do I install the Millett adjustable sights on my Desert Eagle pistol?<br />Front Sight<br /><br />Remove factory sight by tapping out with a soft punch. <br />When retrofitting the optional sight, if front sight is too tight to fit into dovetail, remove a small amount of material from bottom of the sight base and or blade with a file. <br />Use a sight press or smoothed jawed vice to press front sight into place (center of barrel). Be careful not to damage your barrel.<br />Rear Sight<br />Note: Millett Rear Sight Installation<br />To prevent breakage of the windage adjustment screw during installation, remove the rear sight ramp by tapping out the roll pin and backing out the elevation screw all the way. Install the sight base (see &quot;rear sight&quot; #3). <br />Remove factory sight by tapping out with a soft punch. <br />When retrofitting the optional sight, if rear sight is too tight to fit into dovetail, remove a small amount of material from the dovetail of the sight with a file. <br />Use a sight press or soft punch with a patch to center rear sight. Once centered remove elevation screw to access and tighten down the dovetail locking screws. Replace elevation screw. Note: Make sure elevation springs are properly seated in base.<br />Are there night sights for my Desert Eagle pistol?<br />Yes, Trijicon does make fixed night sights. Please contact them directly at 1-800-338-0563 or <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.trijicon-inc.com\">www.trijicon-inc.com</a><!-- w -->.<br />Yes, Meprolight does make adjustable night sights. Please contact them directly at <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.meprolight.com\">www.meprolight.com</a><!-- w --> <br /><br />Are there any laser sights that you recommend for my Desert Eagle pistol?<br />Yes, Laser Devices does make a frame-mounted laser. Please contact them directly at 1-800-235-2162 or <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.laserdevices.com\">www.laserdevices.com</a><!-- w -->. Aimpoint makes a Red Dot. Please contact them directly at 1-703-471-6828.<br /><br />What finish is recommended on my Desert Eagle pistol for damp conditions?<br />It depends on the price you are willing to pay; on the low dollar end it would be the Matte Chrome or Brushed Chrome and on the high dollar end either of the Titaniums. Please do note that any finish can rust including stainless steel, but with proper periodic maintenance and cleaning after each use you should not have any problems. <br /><br />Can I send in my new or used Desert Eagle pistol to be custom finished in one of the finishes you offer?<br />Yes, you can send your Desert Eagle pistol to us for a custom shop finish (takes approximately 90-120 days):<br /><br />Magnum Research, Inc. <br />Attn: Custom Shop<br />7110 University Avenue NE<br />Minneapolis, MN 55432<br /><br />Please include a cover letter stating what you would like done to your pistol, your billing address, a ship-to address (for firearms; this needs to be a business address/or your dealer's address; since we no longer ship a firearm back to a residential address for your safety and ours), a daytime phone number (in case we have any questions), or you may include a copy of this email.

They have excellent customer service right here in the states and if there is ever a problem they will certainly take care of it for you. You might also want to look at the Auto-Ordnance 1911 which can be had for $489 and Para USA 1911 G.I. Expert for about $505.<br />Don",

Also as you say your wife is going to be shooting it also, can she handle a six inch barrel revolver comfortably? I see a lot of men buying a handgun they like and expect their spouses to be able to shoot it comfortably and it does not always work out for them. As far as barrel lenght goes, if youand your wife practices enough what ever you shoot with a 4&quot; or a 6&quot; barrel will not know the difference in accuracy. I also prefer the 4&quot; guns as they shoot just as good as 6&quot; or 7 1/2&quot; guns but pack easier. I am a firm believer of trigger time on the gun range, if you practice you will not need that seventh round. Just my 2 cents.",

        "content": "Generally, I’m another one who prefers a revolver with a 4 inch barrel; however, my hunting, PPC (Police Pistol Combat), and range revolvers all have barrels longer than 4 inches. Why? Because a 6 inch barrel is easier to shoot straight and hits a little harder. I have a custom-built, 6 inch barreled, S&amp;W Model 27 that is absolutely deadly to use. <br /><br />Could I shoot PPC with a 4 or 5 inch barrel? Sure, but, the longer barrel points more quickly and easily. My hunting pistol is an S&amp;W Model 29 with an 8 3/8 inch barrel. This pistol has the best balance and is the most natural pointer of any handgun I’ve ever owned. Personally I wouldn’t shave an inch off my Model 29’s barrel length. <br /><br />My EDC carry revolver is an S&amp;W Model 686 with a 2 1/2 inch barrel. I shoot it well enough for most self-defense scenarios; but you’ve got to remember I’m a practiced double-action revolver shooter. I suppose that if I had only one general purpose revolver it would have a 4 inch barrel; but, I own many revolvers and am able to match various barrel lengths to specific intended uses. For whatever it’s worth, it wouldn’t bother me to use my Model 27 (with it’s 6 inch pipe) as an EDC piece. It’s an easy pointing, hard hitting gun that I happen to have a nice piece of leather for. So, it is possible to carry a concealed revolver with a 6 inch barrel if you happen to have the need. <br /><br />HKS does make 7 round speedloaders. The only problem is you’ve got to be Jerry Miculek in order to use one of those things (with their rotational locks) well. The rest of us, mere mortals, are better off with 6 round, Safariland, ‘Comp II’ speedloaders - For most revolver shooters the Comp II’s (with their push action locks) are, both, faster and easier to use. <br /><br />Consequently I, personally, wouldn’t own a 7 shot revolver; and I would think twice before purchasing any revolver that I couldn't get Comp II speedloaders (or, perhaps, ‘moon clips’) for. 6 in the gun, and 2 full Matt Del Fatti, ‘split-the-belt’ speedloader pouches (12 more cartridges) on the strong-hand side of my gun belt should be more than I’ll ever actually need. <br /><br />By the way, I never use 38 Special cartridges, or cases, in my 357 Magnum revolvers. What I’ve done for many years, now, is to load down longer 357 Magnum cases to 38 Special velocities; or else I purchase commercial, ‘el crapo’ 357 Magnum target loads and use them in my 357’s. Running a lot of shorter 38 Special cartridges through a 357 Mag cylinder can, ‘fire etch’ or powder-corrode the front of each individual chamber. Then, when you return to shooting the longer 357 Magnum cartridges hard extraction can be the result. A few boxes of 38’s won’t do any harm - Especially if you clean the pistol well after each use; I’m talking about a steady diet of 38’s in a 357. THAT is never a good thing.",

This was not an inexpensive fannypack, but it was fabric, not leather. The darned thing may have had lint elves in it. Every week or two I would empty it, turn it upside down and shake it. Looked like a snowstorm sometimes. My current pack is leather and much less prone to linting up. The lint in the pistol itself seemed to accumulate in the slide, creating a drag effect.

They told me to send the gun to Earl's Gun Shop or Gun Repair, I'm not too sure which name. He is located in Tewkwsberry (SP?) Mass. and Walther said that he is the only certified Walther repair person in the USA. He identified the problem as the recoil spring. Shipped the gun back to me pretty quickly. I put about 200 rounds through it with out any problems at all. If you keep it clean and shoot decent ammo out of it you should be pretty happy. It's a neat little gun.",

Went back yesterday and set the PPS aside without handling it and went through the row. all the Sigs was too heavy, Kahr too small, S&amp;W didnt feel good, tried a bunch more, the Glock 19 came up tops. Then handled the PPS. Bought the Glock. It was great that the shop was willing to take a deposit (with guarantee that it could be credited to any gun), hold the PPS and let me walk away and come back. I probably spend 2 1/2 hours over the two visits handling different 9mm's. <br /><br />The only one that came close to the comfort of the Glock was a Walther P99 in .40 cal.<br /><br />toyrfun is 100% right - its all about what feels best in the hand!

Don't like the plastic ones. The ergonomics have changed a bit.<br /><br />The SR9, though new, seems to be a pretty good gun. It's a good size and holds 17 rounds. Go to YouTube and search for &quot;SR9.&quot; There are some pretty good videos there especially a long range segment. I was going to buy a P95 just to have a 9mm plinker, but once I held the SR9 I liked it. I do believe out of the guns you listed, it's the least expensive. More money left for ammo!

Have handled and shot them both. Like them both. I have a friend thats a Minneapolis Police Officer and he carries a M&amp;P. Hes biased towards that. He also says its about 50/50 Glock Vs M&amp;P in his department. I am leaning towards the Glock , but would love your honest opinions. Thanks in advance.<br /><br />BJP",

I have tried several Glocks and the grip angle never seemed natural and they have more flex that the FNP. When I shot the S&amp;W M&amp;P it truly felt right, a smoother trigger, better grip position (compared to a Glock) and no flex. Looking deep the M&amp;P has an stainless steel support framework in the polly to minimize the flex. That was three years ago and I carry my M&amp;P daily knowing it is the best polly frame available. IMHO your friend gave you good advise.<br /><br />Shot them both and make your own choice first hand.",

I know there are posts that have gone over this, but I am just looking for peoples opinions that have owned these guns or shot them. I know its all about what fits you best. Have handled and shot them both. Like them both. I have a friend thats a Minneapolis Police Officer and he carries a M&amp;P. Hes biased towards that. He also says its about 50/50 Glock Vs M&amp;P in his department. I am leaning towards the Glock , but would love your honest opinions. Thanks in advance.<br /><br />BJP</div><br /><br />My biggest issue with both the Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P line of pistols, as well as the Springfield Armory XD line is the constant slide rusting issues that come up all the time with these guns. The Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P Models are having severe rusting issues with the slide, and have been for some time now. Google &quot;Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P slide rusting issues&quot;, and you'll get the phone book.<br /><br /> <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1T4GUEA_enUS362US362&amp;q=Smith+%26+Wesson+M%26P+slide+rusting+issues\">http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=n ... ing+issues</a><!-- m --><br /><br /> This is being caused by the inferior Melonite treatment process to the slide itself. Springfield Armory went through much the same thing with their XD line of pistols a while back. That process did not involve Melonite, but the result was much the same. The slides themselves rusted like an old railroad track, especially when carried in a cold climate. When going from the cold outdoors into a warm building the in / out condensation rusted the slides on these guns in no time.<br /><br /> The reason for this is Melonite, and all of the other trade names this process is sold under, are far inferior to the Tenifer process that is used by Glock. I know someone will argue that, but it is a fact. Melonite, along with the other processes like Tufftride and Nitride, (both gas and liquid), are sold as being, &quot;Just as good&quot;. The fact of the matter is they are not. Certainly not from a rust and or corrosion standpoint. The best proof of this over the years is both companies, (Smith &amp; Wesson and Springfield Armory), who have used the Melonite process, or ones similar to it including the forms of different Phosphate treatments, have all experienced rusting issues, while a Tenifer treated Glock is all but impossible to acquire any rust on in most any environment. This has been proven over and over in torture treatment after torture treatment involving everything from ocean immersion for months on end to storage in rock salt. Tenifer beats all other anti rust metal treatments hands down. It also reduces the coefficient of friction of the surface itself substantially. It is one of the reasons Glock treats the inside of the barrel itself with it. The Tenifer process is .005 M.M. thick, and is close to the hardness of Diamond. This is why it wears so well. It literally takes years of daily carry for a Glock pistol to develop any kind of holster wear on the slide because of this process.<br /><br /> The reason S&amp;W and Springfield Armory don't use it is because the Tenifer process is banned in this country because it cannot be made to meet EPA environmental standards. This is why the Glock pistol is made in Austria, but assembled in this country in Georgia. Glock applies the Tenifer in Austria where the slide and barrel itself is manufactured. The parts are then shipped here, and the pistol assembled, boxed, and shipped to various distributors.<br /><br /> The Springfield Armory XD line of pistols are made in Croatia, but are shipped as completed guns. There really is no reason they could not use the Tenifer process on their XD line unless there is a logistics problem in getting it done, or else there may be a cost issue. I don't know, but I do know that Glock has it, and Springfield does not. Because of that an XD is far more likely to acquire rusting issues than any Glock ever will.<br /><br /> There is in fact zero reason for a modern defensive carry pistol to be prone to rust in today's manufacturing era. These metal treatments are out there. Glock has proven for over 25 years they do in fact work. A Glock has proven to be one of the most, if not THE most weather resistant handgun manufactured to date. You should not have to keep a modern defensive pistol soaked with oil to prevent it from rusting. That is nonsense. It isn't the 1950's anymore. The other manufacturers tout their metal treatment processes like Melonite as &quot;Just as good&quot;, when in fact it has been proven they are not. S&amp;W needs to step up to the plate here. It is 2010 and they are having trouble matching manufacturing standards Glock has set the bar at in the early 80's. To me that is totally unacceptable in today's day and age. Bill T.",

If CZ would have had a stainless model back then, I would have gotten one of those in stead. I am a fan of S&amp;W revolvers and their M-41 and M-52 semi-autos, the other self loaders are not on my short list of guns to get. They go bang but I can not shoot them as well as many, many other makes. In my book they rank above Glock in this regard but that is not saying much ( Lest someone jumps pn me for this, I think highly of Glock as a gun but it does not fit my hand very well which makes it a poor choice for me, I do recommend it to others to try before making a final decision).",

I was wondering if any P238 owners out there have felt the need to do some trigger work on their guns. Do you like the factory trigger &amp; leave it alone? Lighten it up to 5 or 6#'s? Would appreciate any feedback &amp; thanks ahead of time! p.s. Please share any other likes/dislikes concerning your 238's...",

Any way I have a question about a couple of handguns, I am thinking about geting a new handgun for deer hunting. My questions are what caliber should I be thinking about? a buddy of mine says not to buy anything smaller than a 454 casull but I am thinking that I don't need anything bigger than a 44 magnum, I have never shot a 454 but have shot a 44mag. The longest shot that i would probably take is about 50 yards. Also he is saying to buy a Taurus Raging Bull but I am thinking Ruger Super Blackhawk. What are some of your thoughts on these handguns and what caliber do you think. Sorry so long winded. Thanks Jon",

        "content": "The 44mag would be more than sufficient for your needs as well as being much cheaper to shoot (important as it takes quite a bit of practice to become proficient with a handgun). I have a 454 Casull in a Ruger Super Redhawk and much prefer it to any Taurus, I have not been impressed by these guns over the years and for just slightly more money one can get a reliable and proven Ruger. Plus, if anything should go wrong, Ruger customer service is the bar others strive for. <br />The Super Blackhawk is another outstanding gun and I doubt you would be disappointed with it. I do not have a Blackhawk but I do have a pair of Vaqueros which are the &quot;cowboy&quot; version of that gun. They are very rugged and should handle any 44 mag rounds you would care to try. <br />Another option you might consider is the 41 mag. It is not as common a round as the 44 mag so finding factory loads could be a problem but it is a little lighter bullet which would mean a little less recoil. Most companies that field a 44 mag also chamber this cartridge but as I said, it can be much harder to find. <br />I am not a fan of the 357 for deer, it is an experts gun as it leaves very little room for error in shot placement. Too, most factory ammo is not suitable for deer hunting and one needs to look for specialty manufacturers such as Buffalo Bore, Corbon, Garrett, and such which can be tough to find and fairly expensive.",

I also have a TC Contender with 14 inch 44 mag. barrel that has taken more deer at longer ranges, out to 78 yards, measured. I also have a 14 inch barrel in 357 Maximum which is good too. I have taken a few deer with it as well. To me it would be a Ruger or TC. To me no one needs anything any larger than a 44 mag. I mean how dead can you kill something.",

        "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"><br />This Information Was Taken Directly off the Magnum Research Website @ <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"Http://www.MagnumResearch.com\">Http://www.MagnumResearch.com</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Can I shoot reloads in my BFR revolver?<br />I am sorry we do not offer any reloading information since we do not recommend reloading in any of our products. Any use of reloads (problems caused by them) null and void the warranty on any MRI product. However, if you are going to reload we suggest you strictly follow all safe reloading information in a good up to date reloading manual. <br /><br />What loads will the BFR .45/70 handle?<br />Lever action rifle loads, the #2 loads.<br /><br />Can I interchange cylinders on my BFR revolver?<br />Yes, if you have a serial number beginning with the prefix &quot;JT&quot;. We have cylinders for your BFR .45/70 to the .450 Marlin or your .450 Marlin to the .45/70 and also for your .22 Hornet to the .218 BEE. The cylinder does need to be fitted to your BFR revolver either at the time of ordering or you can send in your revolver to us. <br /><br />Can I put the new .410 vent rib on my BFR .45LC/410 revolver?<br />Yes, if you have a serial number with the prefix &quot;JT&quot;. The .410 vent rib is for enhanced sighting on moving targets. Features front and mid-bead. Simply remove front and rear sights and install on your BFR revolver. For those of you that have a BFR revolver with the serial number prefix &quot;DM&quot;, this is also a possibility but we will need to fit it to your existing BFR and there is a some labor charges for this. <br /><br />Just some interesting factoids on the BFR revolvers...<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />100% made in the USA. <br />Handmade by gun people for gun people. Each BFR is meticulously inspected and hand polished, hand fit and hand assembled. <br />Nominated for handgun of the year 2002. <br />Chambered for cartridges that provide heart-stopping power for the serious handgun hunter. <br />Interchangeable cylinders in calibers that utilize the same bullet diameters. The .450 Marlin and .45/70 are fully interchangeable and the .22 Hornet and .218 BEE is also fully interchangeable, cylinders to be fitted by MRI gunsmiths. <br />Free wheeling cylinder allows the shooter the ability spin the cylinder either clockwise or counter clockwise to load or unload the revolver. <br />ACCURACY<br /><br />Barrel cylinder alignment is held to under .002 concentricity. <br />All barrels are precision cut rifled. <br />Barrel cylinder gap is held to less than .005. <br />All barrels are hand lapped. <br />All barrels are precision recessed crowned. <br />Cylinder tolerances are so tight that best accuracy is available with all chambers. <br />Tolerances between the cylinder throat and internal barrel dimensions are matched to each caliber. <br />Many of the BFR's calibers will shoot groups of well under 2&quot; at 50 yards with mechanical sights. <br />All calibers feature twist rates specifically matched to the ammunition available and barrel lengths offered. <br />QUALITY<br /><br />The BFR utilizes state of the art tough stainless alloys through out. We use five different types of stainless steel in each revolver so that we can produce the strongest, most weather resistant handgun available. Some of these alloys are extremely hard to machine but the end result is worth it. Each part is made from the best stainless alloy that will give it the strength and hardness necessary to hold up for the powerful loads it is chambered for. <br />The BFR is hand finished to a beautiful soft-brushed finish, which is more weather resistant and practical than vapor honed or satin finished guns. This soft-brushed finish is also very easily restored by the gun-owner. <br />Fully adjustable rear sights and a full complement of different front sight heights allow guaranteed point of impact for all individual shooting styles. <br />All grip frame screws are specially hardened and plated hex head screws that WILL hold up under continuous repeated firing of heavy loads. <br />Frames, grip frames and cylinders are machined in precision CNC equipment with a proprietary process developed specifically for the BFR. This process insures the dimensional integrity of ALL of our parts. The frame alone has over 70 features that are measured after machining to insure quality. <br />All guns are proof fired after assembly to insure integrity of the entire revolver and its total function. <br />THE ONLY'S<br /><br />Only .450 Marlin revolver. <br />Only .45/70 revolver that is not a joke. This gun really works and shoots like a laser. <br />Only .45 Long Colt/. 410 revolver <br />The one .480 Ruger/.475 Linebaugh under $1,000 retail. <br />Only serious heavy caliber handgun that is designed from the floor up to eat up the powerful cartridges that it is chambered for. The BFR is NOT a standard revolver &quot;converted&quot; to a heavy caliber. It is designed and built as a heavy caliber handgun and will hold up to the test of repeated and sustained firing. <br />RECOIL <br /><br />The BFR in 45/70 recoils less than any .44 Magnum that weighs under 3-pounds. <br />Recoil is a factor of bullet weight, velocity and gun weight. <br />Remember recoil is not a factor of size, just because it is physically large does not mean that it recoils large. The BFR simply weighs a little more than other revolvers because of its heavy design for powerful ammunition. The added weight makes the gun balance better, makes it easier to hold steady and makes it recoil less…Period. <br />The 45/70 will produce the same velocity as the 454 Casull with 2/3 less pressure, and a lot less noise and muzzle flash. This is because the 45/70 case is longer so it allows for different types of gunpowder to be used and the case has more room for the burning and expanding gases to expand. The end result is less pressure, less wear and tear on the gun, less noise and less recoil. <br />SAFETY<br /><br />The BFR uses a transfer bar that will not allow the gun to fire unless the trigger is pulled back to release the hammer only after it has been fully cocked. There is no need to carry the gun with an empty chamber while hunting. The BFR will not fire if it has been accidentally dropped. <br />Special processes are used for heat treating critical parts. <br />All guns are proof fired after assembly to insure integrity of the entire revolver and its total function.<br />RECOIL OF FACTORY REVOLVERS AND LOADS<br />Formula: Add velocity to bullet weight and multiply that number by the velocity. Then divide by the weight of the firearm multiplied by 80. <br /><br />BFR .450 Marlin, 10-Inch <br /> 4.5 lbs. <br /> 350-gr.

Bullet <br /> 1400 FPS <br /> 98.96 Recoil Factor<br /> <br /><br /><br />BFR .45/70 recoils less than all of the above guns including the lowly .44 Magnum with a 4 5/8-inch barrel. The advantages of the .45/70 over the .454 Casull are that the .45/70 is an extremely potent hunting cartridge that is loaded at EXTREMELY low pressures. The Casull is loaded at over 50,000 PSI and the .45/70 is loaded under 25,000 PSI. The .45/70 can be hand-loaded to exceed .454 Casull velocity and still be under 30,000 PSI! There is the big advantage. Much less recoil and half the working pressure means the guns will shoot better and last longer. Ammo is also a lot less expensive and more readily available. THE LONG .45/70 CARTRIDGE DOES NOT MEAN MORE RECOIL IT MEANS MUCH LESS PRESSURE BECAUSE THE POWDER HAS MORE ROOM TO EXPAND, GIVING EQUAL PERFORMANCE WITH LESS PRESSURE. <br /><br />BFR VELOCITY WITH SELECTED AMMO<br />(All tested with PACT Chronograph) <br /><br />.45/70, 7.5-Inch Barrel<br /><br />300 grain Federal Sierra Classic, average 1472 FPS and muzzle energy 1444 FT/LBS<br /><br />300 grain Winchester Super X, average 1272 FPS and muzzle energy 1078 FL/LBS <br /><br />405 grain PMC, average 980 FPS and muzzle energy 864 FT/LBS<br /><br /><br />.45/70, 10-Inch Barrel <br /><br />300 grain Federal Sierra Classic, average 1507 FPS and muzzle energy 1513 FT/LBS<br /><br />300 grain Winchester Super X, average 1405 FPS and muzzle energy 1315 FT/LBS<br /><br />405 grain PMC, average 1056 FPS and muzzle energy 1003 FT/LBS<br /><br /><br />.444 Marlin, 10-Inch Barrel <br /><br />240 grain Remington Soft Point, average 1831 FPS and muzzle energy 1787 FT/LBS<br /><br /><br />.450 Marlin, 10-Inch Barrel<br /><br />350 grain Hornady, average 1814 FPS and muzzle energy 2558 FT/LBS<br /><br /><br />.480 Ruger, 7.5-Inch Barrel<br /><br />325 grain Hornady XTP, average 1409 FPS and muzzle energy 1433 FT/LBS<br /><br /><br />.475 Linebaugh, 7.5-Inch Barrel<br /><br />400 grain Hornady, average 1424 FPS and muzzle energy 1802 FT/LBS<br /><br /><br />.500 S&amp;W, 7.5-Inch Barrel<br /><br />275 grain Barnes X CorBon, average 1770 FPS and muzzle energy 1914 FT/LBS<br /><br />400 grain Hawk SP CorBon, average 1679 FPS and muzzle energy 2504 FT/LBS<br /><br />440 grain Hard Cast CorBon, average 1671 FPS and muzzle energy 2729 FT/LBS<br /><br /><br />.500 S&amp;W, 10-Inch Barrel<br /><br />275 grain Barnes X CorBon, average 1856 FPS and muzzle energy 2104 FT/LBS<br /><br />400 grain Hawk SP CorBon, average 1752 FPS and muzzle energy 2727 FT/LBS<br /><br />440 grain Hard Cast CorBon, average 1718 FPS and muzzle energy 2884 FT/LBS<br /><br /><br />.50AE, 6.5-Inch Barrel<br /><br />300 grain Samson Ultra JHP, average 1550 FPS and muzzle energy 1601 FT/LBS<br /><br />300 grain Samson Ultra JSP, average 1425 FPS and muzzle energy 1353 FT/LBS<br /><br />350 grain MRI/Blount JSP, average 1410 FPS and muzzle energy 1545 FT/LBS<br /><br /><br />All ammo and firearms can and will produce slightly different results.

        "content": "imo, the XD is a good gun. what you will find is that everyone has their favorites. I, in general, like anything that goes bang. some more then the others.<br /><br />I got an XD45 Tactical and thought the trigger sucked. The S&amp;W M&amp;P that i was also feeling sucked more. I ended up with the XD and was plesently surprised the trigger smoothed up alot within the first few hundred rounds at the range. It may not happen with all XDs, but it did w/mine. Its something you should remember that all guns are not the same. I also ended up with the M&amp;P a few months later. It still can use some smoothing tho.<br /><br />youve tried alot of guns and that alot more then others. so use that experince to guide you, but it doesnt hurt to try as many as possible.",

        "content": "The Blue Book of Gun Values has a listing for model PPK pre-war production, 1931-1940. At the bottom of that section it states you should add 60% to the value for a bottom release magazine in .32 ACP. <br /> <br />It also has a separate listing for a model PPK Lightweight, aluminum version. It says to add 20% to the .32 caliber commercial price listing. <br /> <br />So it appears that you have commercial, pre-war, PPK Lightweight in .32 cal with bottom mag release, so you would add at least 80% to the listed value. <br /> <br />A PPK pre-war .32 caliber, rated 100% condition lists as $725.00. <br /> <br />So according to the book, one with a bottom mag release would be worth $1,160. <br /> <br />And since it's a aluminum alloy frame you could add 20% to that and it would be worth $1,392.00. <br /> <br />Or if you wanted to be conservative and just add 80% to the base price of $725.00, the value would be $1,305.00.",

I was surprised that the recoil is about the same as my S&amp;W 9mm..........I expected something more!<br /><br />2. I bought a box of Magtech 230 grain FMJ when I bought the gun.......it was what the dealer had. I only had time to run 2 magazines through it and there were no problems.<br /><br />3. That target is one I printed off in a hurry..........black portion is 4 inches. I have a bench and will be running a few rounds from a rest to see what the gun can do.<br /><br />4.

The .38 special is a great all around caliber and can be found in all sizes of revolver. I agree with the idea of buying a .357 and shooting .38's, but additional cleaning is necessary. I don't believe most of the little snub-nosed .357's are good .357's because of the terrible recoil, but they are great .38's. There are several good mid-sized .357's from Ruger and S&amp;W. Don't let anyone tell you that you should only buy a semi-auto. Look around, shoot as many as you can of all types and calibers and then pick the one you &quot;shoot&quot; the best, not the one that is most popular.",

        "content": "Brief history from older article... <br /> <br />Jack Scott's Senate Bill 489 - a 2003 bill that takes effect Sunday - is touted by gun-control groups as first-of-its-kind legislation. It targets a specific kind of accidental shooting, involving a single unspent round fired from a handgun thought to be unloaded. <br />Semiautomatic pistols rechamber a bullet with each pull of the trigger, so a user can detach the magazine, believe the gun is empty, pull the trigger and only then discover that a live round was in the chamber. Under SB 489, new models of rim-fire semiautomatic pistols introduced to the California market after Sunday must have a disconnect mechanism to prevent firing when the magazine is removed. These models generally fire .22-caliber ammunition. <br /> <br />New center-fire semiautomatics after New Year's Day must be equipped with either a magazine disconnect mechanism or a chamber load indicator that warns of an unspent round. These models typically use 9 mm and other such rounds. <br /> <br />In one year - by January 2007 - all new center-fire models must contain both safety devices. <br /> <br />full story at <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/content/politics/story/14023757p-14856134c.html\">http://www.sacbee.com/content/politics/ ... 6134c.html</a><!-- m -->",

I, in general, like anything that goes bang. some more then the others.<br /><br />I got an XD45 Tactical and thought the trigger sucked. The S&amp;W M&amp;P that i was also feeling sucked more. I ended up with the XD and was plesently surprised the trigger smoothed up alot within the first few hundred rounds at the range. It may not happen with all XDs, but it did w/mine. Its something you should remember that all guns are not the same. I also ended up with the M&amp;P a few months later. It still can use some smoothing tho.<br /><br />youve tried alot of guns and that alot more then others. so use that experince to guide you, but it doesnt hurt to try as many as possible.",

You can certainly put a lot of holes in the target's center <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /> <br /> <br />Before I bought it, I talked to several very good shooters and the owner of the range I shoot at.

My Makarov is the 380 ACP version. I have had my Mak for about 24 years now. It shoots as good today as it did when it was new. It has never FTF or FTE a single round in all these years. <br /> <br />I carry my Mak in my car console, and sometimes in my pocket. <br /> <br />It is a single stack magazine holding 9 rounds + one in the chamber. It is a Double Action pistol so your first shot is nothing more than pulling the trigger. It will carry in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Condition One</span>, but it makes me a little nervous relying on the safety. So, I carry it with the hammer down. It uses an <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">inertia firing pin</span> so you don't have to worry about accidental ingition from dropping or hitting the hammer. <br /> <br /><img src=\"http://tech.flygsw.org/mak.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />",

The new Hornady 45 Colt 225gr Flex Tip leverevelution is more powerful than the 45 acp unless you chamber a +P round so there is really no need. Plus with the Shorter 45 acp casing now you have the potential for a different carbon ring to develope if you shoot them alot. If you clean your guns regularly this wont be a problem but why take the chance. The 45 acp is really only for the Semi auto lovers. Since you are a revolver man stick with a revolver cartridge. If you do your own loading there is a load that is called the Ruger/TC load from Hornady that will run circles around even a 45 acp +P load.<br /> <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /> <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />",

Of the 2 I'd go with the .44 as will a thousand others I'm sure. A lot of people recommend the .44 mag for it's versatility and availability of ammo and they're right. But I wish people would stop suggesting it for the use of .44 special. That round is damn hard to find and no cheaper than the magnums. My .454 is no more expensive to feed than the .44 mag and the .45 long colts are much easier to find if you want a mild plinking round for comparison to the .44 mag/special combo. For me the .454 works better. It doesn't get shot as much as it gets carried that's for sure. But when I do shoot it, I shoot well. And it'll give me a little more confidence in the presence of big, nasty critters. That's why I keep it.............In addition shooting .45 long colt in a .454 casull. I've learned that it might be possible to customize full moon clips for .45 acp revolvers and shoot that round in the .454 as well. Anyone else hear of this or see it done?</div><br /><br />I forgot to mention earlier you made a great caliber choice. I hope you choose a Ruger or Smith. Dont settle for anything less in a revolver. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />",

It felt incredible in my hands. I mean the comfort was top notch! That sold me on it alone but then the mag release is right under the trigger guard...WOAH!!!! Sweet deff another plus for me.<br /><br />Her choice was actually my first pick ( haha funny , huh ) the Bersa Firestorm 380 which is an updated/slight modded version of Bersa's Thunder Series. Felt really solid/sturdy, a good 5 ounces more then the PK380 unloaded (guesstiment) <br /><br />My question is has anyone shot/owned these guns?<br /><br />The pros/cons and other details would be much appreciated!",

Even the 40 isn't too bad to shoot, I can shoot the center out of a B-27 target out to about 5 yards without thinking. 10 yards or double taps to COM and one to the head takes a bit more concentration but this is not meant to be a long range or precision gun. The KelTec website seems to have quite a bit of info on their guns, at least that is the impression I got from a quick scan of it. <br />Oh yeah, Kimber puts out a quality gun, I think they just put out a double stack model which means I'll have to look at them a little closer.",

        "content": "If you really want to get a derringer, I'd suggest an automatic cartridge, simply because they are shorter. This gives your bullet a little extra barrel to work with than the longer revolver cartridges, and it may be a bit more accurate. The .40 may be a good one. More power than the 9mm, yet not as much boom as a .45ACP. <br /> <br />I think the American Derringer is more compact and easier to carry. Sure the Bond is bigger and stronger, but I hardly think anyone is going to put a thousand rounds a year through a derringer.

        "content": "Revolvers are simpler to operate and generally more reliable than autoloading pistols. Other than that, it all comes down to personal preference. Either one is deadly in the hands of a proficient shooter.<br /><br />If you are new to handguns, I'd recommend starting with a .22 rimfire. The only way to become proficient with a handgun is to shoot it.... LOTS. Some qualified instruction is also a good idea.... if you can't come up with any, here's the next best thing:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.bullseyepistol.com/chapterf.htm\">http://www.bullseyepistol.com/chapterf.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Also, as you spend some tiume at the range, you'll have the opportunity to see (and probably try) other handguns, as well as BS with the guys about the pros and cons of various makes, models, amd calibers. Once you have a better feel for what you would like, it's time to go shopping.<br /><br />I have a pile of revolvers, both SA and DA, in everything from .22 rimfire to .44 Magnum. For autoloaders, I have a couple Ruger .22 pistols and 3 1911s, all in .45 ACP. My personal preference for home defense is a 4&quot; Smith &amp; Wesson M19. For considerably less money, the Colt Trooper or Trooper Mark III is a fine revolver.<br /><br />For currently produced American products, Ruger and Smith &amp; Wesson are the big revolver producers. Ruger sells both SA and DA revolvers, while Smith sells only DA. A Ruger revolver lacks the refinement of an old Smith, but is well-designed, and tough as a Sherman Tank. Aside from the recently introduced &quot;Classic&quot; series, I much prefer to buy older, used S&amp;W revolvers rather than the new ones.<br /><br />Autoloading pistols currently produced in the U.S. - Smith &amp; Wesson, Colt, Springfield Armory, Ruger, Kimber, Wilson Combat, and a whole bunch of others. All produce good quality firearms. There are a few producers of cheap pistols.... avoid them.",

        "content": "i would hope you would do some target practice since its your resonsibility to be able to handle the weapon properly.<br /><br />good luck in your search for American made guns. there arent alot anymore. Ruger, S&amp;W is all i can think of.<br /><br />also, since your wife will be using it too, you MAY have to settle for 2 different guns. <br /><br />Autoloaders can malfunction and if you decide to get one, both you and your wife will need to learn how to clear malfunctions. Its just part of owning one. You may not like it, but it will be necessary since you will never know when a malfunction will occur.<br /><br />Revolvers are more simple in operation but you will have a more limited round capacity. Even a revolver can malfunction but if its still working, all you would have to do is to pull the trigger again. As with the autoloader, you should learn how to load/unload the revolver using minimal steeps and keep your eyes on the target as much as possible.<br /><br />I would look for a gun rental range in your area and do some testing of their guns. keep in mind tho that some ranges dont take good care of their guns so some autoloaders may malfunction alot. the idea is to get a feel of whats out there and what you may lean towards getting.<br /><br />in terms of calibers, i would look at 9mm, 40 and 357. one thing nice about the 357 is that you can shoot 38s if you choose. However, the other way isnt recommended.<br /><br />there are some good used guns out there now, but unless you know what to look for, you can get screwed. or unless you know of a trusted smith that is willing to evaluate them you could go that route.",

        "content": "Good advice already given.<br /><br />A couple of questions that may help in giving you a more defined search. What is the budget you plan to spend on your firearm? While this is your first handgun have you shot handguns before? <br /><br />If possible find a range that rents pistols and shoot a few to get a feel for what fits you best. Even if you have to drive a couple of hours to a range that rents it is well worth your time. <br /><br />Smith &amp; Wesson and Ruger make fine handguns and seem to have a model for just about everyone. Revolvers are easier to operate and maintain but are limited to the number of rounds they hold. In most cases the 5-7 rounds should be enough if you know how to fire the pistol well. With practice semi autos are a fine choice, they are more complex but not to a level that they are difficult to shoot or maintain. Most semi autos will provide a higher capacity of ammo between reloands and reloading is far quicker if you purchase an extra mag. I own both revolvers and semi autos and could make a case for either. It comes down to personal choice.<br /><br />Best advice is to take the time and find a pistol that fits you well and then shoot on a regular basis to improve your skill and expereince with your firearm.",

        "content": "Difficult to give you an answer without some additional information, however if the gun is to be used by more than one person, you should pick a gun that is easily used by the least experienced person. For most, that is a revolver in a medium caliber like 38/357. I suggest a 4&quot; barrel and grips should be selected to fit the smallest hands. The 38/357 caliber allows you to learn with light 38 loads and work up to whatever level you want in 38+p and 357 magnum. The price of ammo is about as good as it gets these days for centerfire ammo.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with selecting a semi-auto as long as you and your wife are willing to put in the time to learn to shoot, clear jams, reload and understand all the functions of a semi-auto. I have been an NRA instructor for over 20 years and the vast majority of my students were beginners who quickly learned to shoot a revolver. Many were overwhelmed with the manual of arms for a semi-auto. If you pick a gun your wife likes to shoot, you will have a shooting partner. If you don't, you will have an observer.",

I don't have to check to see if it's the right caliber.<br /> 4. I don't hit my neighbor in the next booth, or myself, with spent brass.<br /> 5. I don't lose (misplace) magazines.<br /> 6. I don't have to load magazines, and my thumbs are happy.<br /> 7. I don't have to clear jams.<br /> 8. I like making the guys shooting the wimpy 9mm guns jump when my .357 or .44 mag goes off!<br /> 9. I've been through the &quot;spray and pray&quot; phase in my younger days, and now rely on shot placement to get the job done.<br />10. You don't go through your ammo as fast, and you get to enjoy more time shootin'.<br />11. I don't have to remember how to take the blasted slide off and disassemble the gun to clean it. Too many pieces.<br />12. I don't have to put all those pieces back together.<br />13. Cleaning a revolver is easy, and they are all the same.<br />14. It takes three seconds to disassemble a single action revolver, and you've only got three parts: frame, cylinder, and pin.<br />15. The grip is always a nice, comfortable size because you don't have a magazine running through the middle of it.<br />16. You can completely change the looks and feel of the gun by changing grips: rubber, wood (so many to choose from), ivory, micarta, smooth, checkered, finger grooves, gunfighter, etc., etc., etc.<br />17. And not only is it &quot;All American&quot; but it's intimidating as hell when you pull out a N-frame S&amp;W, or a Colt Anaconda, or a big mama Ruger SA or DA revolver. Something about a revolver just says, &quot;Bubba, I'm about to put a hole through you big enough to park my pick up.&quot;<br />18. When pointed at someone, they can SEE that cylinder full of ash trays 'bout to come their way, and they'll believe that story about the pick up.<br />19. I know my .41 mag, .44 mag, .357 mag, .44 Sp., or .45 Colt will accomplish #17. The only automatic round that will do the job right is the All American .45 ACP (thank you John Moses Browning). I hear the 10mm ain't half bad, and S&amp;W makes a revolver for that, too.",

He is in his low-to-mid 20's. He is a fairly decent fellow, maybe a bit prone to the dramatic. <br /> <br />At any rate, he carries a Glock concealed most of the time. I have zero problem with that. However, from time to time, he feels it necessary to pull the pistol out, flash it, fiddle with the slide, and say some corny line (\"let's do this\" seems to be a favorite). This practice makes me uncomfortable, even though it is generally done in a more private location. <br /> <br />What do you think? I think the weapon should be handled with more respect. While I'm sure he's proud of the ability to carry concealed and to have a decent pistol, it seems a bit much.",

I believe it only takes one complaint from a concerned witness to have that CCW suspended or revoked. A CCW is for personal protection of yourself and those around you, not to make you feel manly. Tell this guy to grow up or leave it at home, he's making the rest of us look bad. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif\" alt=\":evil:\" title=\"Evil or Very Mad\" />",

A gun wont help you if some guy knows where you carry it and comes from behind to snatch it. <br /> <br />I think you should wait till he does it again and take the time to bring up your concerns with him. If you dont like him very much to begin with, just report him. I imagine this happenning to me (I am not a lucky person), I would be hanging out with this guy while he is playing with his gun in public (eeww) and some mother with her four kids walks past us and decides to call the police and push any legal issues.

Although, that's been my training with handguns. I know that Police officers often bring out their handguns in situations were they \"may\" be required to shoot it.

Sig. makes excellent pistols. I dont own a glock but have the xd-45 and xd-9 and both are excellent in my opinion. I recently purchased a new model FNP-45 and really like it.

Handguns are very subjective - what I prefer may not do anything at all for you - which is &quot;best&quot; is relative. <br /> <br />You are fortunate to have so many really good designs to choose from. The problem is that you have so many really good designs to choose from. <br /> <br />You could not go far wrong with any of the pistols you listed, but find something that just seems to fit your hand, and is what you want. You can only do this by handling variouys pistols and shooting as many various types as you can. <br /> <br />Good luck, and I hope you enjoy your search. <br /> <br />mark",

        "content": "There are a number of good guns out there in both 9mm and 45, but depending of your experience, what is best for me may not be best for you. <br /> <br />Do you want a single action, double action, double action only, etc., high capacity (big grip), a concealed carry gun, and on and on. <br /> <br />I personally like Glocks, Walther PPK types and 1911 semi autos. Glocks are soft feeling when fired and the polymer frame soaks up a lot of the recoil force. The Walther is just something I like in a small auto and of course, the old standard Government 45. (1911) <br /> <br />Each of them operates differently and requires practice to get familiar with them. If I &quot;had&quot; to pick just one for both calibers it would probably be a Glock 19 (9mm) and a Glock 21sf (45). They are reliable, reasonably accurate and not too expensive. Others like the Springfield XD (doesn't fit my hand as well), but it is a good gun. <br /> <br />Having said all that, unless you are locked into a semi-auto, don't ignore revolvers. Depending on your needs, there are hundreds of revolvers out there that can serve you well. <br /> <br />I suggest you rent or borrow as many different types of handgun as you can, shoot them and then make a decision. As you can tell, I don't believe there is &quot;one best&quot; gun in any caliber.",

        "content": "My preference is both JMB designs.<br /><br />As far as the 45acp, it would be one of the Kimber 1911 series. I have 2, one is a full-size Royal the other a Ecilpse Pro II, love them both. Out of the box accuracy, dependable and has all the bells and whistles at a fraction of the cost of Wilson, Novak, Yost, etc... <br /><br />The 9mm it is the Browning High Power. Over the years I have had several, but stupid me ( <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Rolling Eyes\" /> ) I get bored with them, sell them, then have to try and find another when I realize that it is &quot;THE&quot; pistol for me! Simple in design yet accurate and dependable. One of the first if not the first to realize the importance of ergonomics of design, the gun feels like the natural extention of my hand.<br /><br />The nice thing about both is that they carry exactly the same so there is no confusion in handling them under stress.<br /><br />With that said, if you're new to pistols I would recommend a &quot;Double Action Only&quot; for ease of training, handling and safety. The DAO pistol is as close as you can come to a revolver in a pistol. The thing that I like about that action is the only thing that you have to think about is point and squeeze the trigger.<br /><br />In that case I would recommend then the Kahr P series pistols both in 9mm and 45acp. My daily carry is a Kahr TP9 with one backup magazine, I like it for is it's thin profile, light weight, and low maintance (s/s and polymer) makes it ideal (in my opinion) for everyday carry. When I know that I'm going into a area where there is a better then likely chace of problems, then I carry either the Ecilpse or the HP for their superior firepower (bullet mass or numbers) and not concern myself with their inferior (to the Kahr's) concealibility.",

        "content": "I would just add that I agree with the previous poster who said the Browning Hi-Power is a gun that just seems to fit my hand like it was made to be there and hits pretty much anything I point it at. It is one sweet gun, so long as you don't mind a single action/double action pistol. <br /><br />As for the Model 1911 style of gun, you might want to have a look at this month's edition of Field &amp; Stream. They have a two-page chart showing the history and development of that gun that tells a story of a basic gun design that has survived and flourished over its 100 year history. Makes you want to go out and buy another one.",

The Tokarev I have actually has an insert welded into the back of the magwell where the full-sized 7.62 mag would have gone, but it's still for smaller hands. <br /> <br />The Tok's got style. It actually points pretty well with the standard grips (compared to the CZ, which takes some getting used to). The button magazine release is quite nice compared to the CZ heel release, and the mags seem to drop free consistently. It's a bit finicky on ammo, though...handloading it up a few notches from factory (nothing near maximum, mind you) kicked the slide back hard enough to improve feed reliability...with Remington in particular it could get stuck doublefeeding and stovepiping from time to time, even without a limp wrist. <br /> <br />Frickin' love the CZ52, though. It's a tackdriver if you feed it good ammo, smooth recoil, reliable as hell once you get good magazines...1000+ rounds and not a single failure to feed or eject on mine. And it shoots 9 with a drop-in barrel.",

Please rank and be specific about the make, model, caliber and your reason.<br /><br />For example,<br /><br />1.) Springfield 1911 Operator/45 ACP - excellent grips and accurate shooter<br /><br />2.) HK P30 /40 S&amp;W - like the night sights and grip ergonomics<br /><br />3.) Glock 34 /9mm - fun to shoot quickly and easy to field strip",

        "content": "1. From a collectors standpoint (I am a collector) I love the German Luger in all Variations. It's beautiful design to this day is to me a very elegant and unique looking pistol ;and it's cartridge is still one of the most popular of the day.<br /><br />2. Without a doubt second is the Walther HP. This is better known as the Walther P-38, P-38 being the MIlitary designation. It's double action, solid locking block safety makes this design just as modern today as it was in 1938 and the Beretta 92 emulates it internally completely.<br /><br />3. I would have to say the Colt single Action Army. A true AMerican classic.",

        "title": "Taurus = Junk!",
        "content": "I bought a Taurus model 17MBCH chambered in .17 HMR (see Page 24. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.taurususa.com/gun-search.cfm\">http://www.taurususa.com/gun-search.cfm</a><!-- m -->) three years ago. I wanted a small revolver as a backup and I am very impressed with the .17HMR. This revolver carries 8 rounds, is “hammer-less”, and is fairly lightweight. When it arrived I ran to the local indoor range to see how it would perform. I went through the first 8 without a problem. I reloaded and fired until the third round when I noticed a dramatic increase in the amount of trigger pull. It fired once more and locked up! I had to wait 20 minutes until it cooled down enough to open the cylinder. I ended up “tapping” the ejector rod on the table top to extract the spent cases and live ammo. Since that event it has been to the Taurus factory and returned to me three times. It still does the same trick, I can't get beyond the twelfth round before it locks up. So far I've spent more than $100 in shipping fees and now I'm looking at sending it back for good. That's another $30!!! I'm going to write Taurus a note telling them how I feel about the quality of their “fine” products. I doubt they will give me my money back, more than likely I will get a coupon good for redemption towards the purchase of another “fine” Taurus product. I will post their response here provided I get an answer. <br />Anyone want to buy a paperweight that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">looks</span> like a gun?",

This revolver carries 8 rounds, is “hammer-less”, and is fairly lightweight.&quot; <br />I couldn't find anything that matched what I wanted so I ended up with a Taurus.<br />I looked at Smith &amp; Wesson's .17 HMR Model 647 pistol but It looks to me like a revision of their .44 mag. So it was not a candidate for carrying concealed.<br />The only Beretta I could find chambered in HMR. 17 is a rifle.<br />The same applies to Springfield Armory and H&amp;K, no pistol in HMR .17. At least I couldn't find one.<br />So if you have a URL for any pistol chambered for HMR .17, Id very much like to see it. Please!<br />Thanks for the reply.<br />Mav39",

I am very impressed with Hornaday's HMR .17 ammo that claims a muzzle velocity of 2550 fps. I think the muzzle velocity would compensate for the bb sized projectile in a close quarters situation. While it most likely wouldn't put an attacker down I'm sure it would get their attention. I used to own two rifles chambered in HMR .17 and I was impressed with their performance until Remington recalled their rifle. Seems like Remington didn't do their homework on this one.",

        "content": "Hi everybody, I surf this site all the time and thought I would register and say hi. Any way I have a question about a couple of handguns, I am thinking about geting a new handgun for deer hunting. My questions are what caliber should I be thinking about? a buddy of mine says not to buy anything smaller than a 454 casull but I am thinking that I don't need anything bigger than a 44 magnum, I have never shot a 454 but have shot a 44mag. The longest shot that i would probably take is about 50 yards. Also he is saying to buy a Taurus Raging Bull but I am thinking Ruger Super Blackhawk. What are some of your thoughts on these handguns and what caliber do you think. Sorry so long winded. Thanks Jon",

        "content": "The 44mag would be more than sufficient for your needs as well as being much cheaper to shoot (important as it takes quite a bit of practice to become proficient with a handgun). I have a 454 Casull in a Ruger Super Redhawk and much prefer it to any Taurus, I have not been impressed by these guns over the years and for just slightly more money one can get a reliable and proven Ruger. Plus, if anything should go wrong, Ruger customer service is the bar others strive for. <br />The Super Blackhawk is another outstanding gun and I doubt you would be disappointed with it. I do not have a Blackhawk but I do have a pair of Vaqueros which are the &quot;cowboy&quot; version of that gun. They are very rugged and should handle any 44 mag rounds you would care to try. <br />Another option you might consider is the 41 mag. It is not as common a round as the 44 mag so finding factory loads could be a problem but it is a little lighter bullet which would mean a little less recoil. Most companies that field a 44 mag also chamber this cartridge but as I said, it can be much harder to find. <br />I am not a fan of the 357 for deer, it is an experts gun as it leaves very little room for error in shot placement. Too, most factory ammo is not suitable for deer hunting and one needs to look for specialty manufacturers such as Buffalo Bore, Corbon, Garrett, and such which can be tough to find and fairly expensive.",

        "content": "+1 on Rugers. <br /> <br />A .44 Mag or .45 Colt (particularly if you handload) should work well for your intended use. Unless you want to use a scope, a Super Blackhawk or Bisley would be nice. I personally prefer the Bisleys, but many don't. <br /> <br />If you want to scope the revolver, a Super Redhawk would work, but it's pretty bulky if you walk around a lot. In .45/.454, extracting fired cases can also be difficult. <br /> <br />I've not used one, but the Ruger Hunter models have a good reputation among folks that prefer a scoped single action for hunting.",

The use of rifles or handguns to hunt turkeys, waterfowl, or any other federally regulated migratory game bird (except crows) is prohibited. The use of handguns to hunt deer is prohibited. Hunting on private land with ammunition larger than .22 caliber rimfire long rifle during the private land shotgun/rifle deer season is prohibited unless the user has a valid private land deer season permit and landowner consent form. The use of rifles to hunt deer is subject to additional restrictions (see Private Land Shotgun/Rifle Season). The use of ammunition larger than .22 caliber rimfire long rifle to hunt raccoon or opossum at night is prohibited. A person using a handgun for hunting must possess any required state/town permits to carry. Note that it is legal to use .17 caliber rimfire firearms in all situations where it is legal to use .22 caliber rimfire long rifle firearms.</div> <br /> <br />That seems kind of restrictive.

Either one is deadly in the hands of a proficient shooter.<br /><br />If you are new to handguns, I'd recommend starting with a .22 rimfire. The only way to become proficient with a handgun is to shoot it.... LOTS. Some qualified instruction is also a good idea.... if you can't come up with any, here's the next best thing:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.bullseyepistol.com/chapterf.htm\">http://www.bullseyepistol.com/chapterf.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Also, as you spend some tiume at the range, you'll have the opportunity to see (and probably try) other handguns, as well as BS with the guys about the pros and cons of various makes, models, amd calibers. Once you have a better feel for what you would like, it's time to go shopping.<br /><br />I have a pile of revolvers, both SA and DA, in everything from .22 rimfire to .44 Magnum. For autoloaders, I have a couple Ruger .22 pistols and 3 1911s, all in .45 ACP. My personal preference for home defense is a 4&quot; Smith &amp; Wesson M19. For considerably less money, the Colt Trooper or Trooper Mark III is a fine revolver.<br /><br />For currently produced American products, Ruger and Smith &amp; Wesson are the big revolver producers. Ruger sells both SA and DA revolvers, while Smith sells only DA. A Ruger revolver lacks the refinement of an old Smith, but is well-designed, and tough as a Sherman Tank. Aside from the recently introduced &quot;Classic&quot; series, I much prefer to buy older, used S&amp;W revolvers rather than the new ones.<br /><br />Autoloading pistols currently produced in the U.S. - Smith &amp; Wesson, Colt, Springfield Armory, Ruger, Kimber, Wilson Combat, and a whole bunch of others. All produce good quality firearms. There are a few producers of cheap pistols.... avoid them.",

Ruger, S&amp;W is all i can think of.<br /><br />also, since your wife will be using it too, you MAY have to settle for 2 different guns. <br /><br />Autoloaders can malfunction and if you decide to get one, both you and your wife will need to learn how to clear malfunctions. Its just part of owning one. You may not like it, but it will be necessary since you will never know when a malfunction will occur.<br /><br />Revolvers are more simple in operation but you will have a more limited round capacity. Even a revolver can malfunction but if its still working, all you would have to do is to pull the trigger again. As with the autoloader, you should learn how to load/unload the revolver using minimal steeps and keep your eyes on the target as much as possible.<br /><br />I would look for a gun rental range in your area and do some testing of their guns. keep in mind tho that some ranges dont take good care of their guns so some autoloaders may malfunction alot. the idea is to get a feel of whats out there and what you may lean towards getting.<br /><br />in terms of calibers, i would look at 9mm, 40 and 357. one thing nice about the 357 is that you can shoot 38s if you choose. However, the other way isnt recommended.<br /><br />there are some good used guns out there now, but unless you know what to look for, you can get screwed. or unless you know of a trusted smith that is willing to evaluate them you could go that route.",

        "content": "Good advice already given.<br /><br />A couple of questions that may help in giving you a more defined search. What is the budget you plan to spend on your firearm? While this is your first handgun have you shot handguns before? <br /><br />If possible find a range that rents pistols and shoot a few to get a feel for what fits you best. Even if you have to drive a couple of hours to a range that rents it is well worth your time. <br /><br />Smith &amp; Wesson and Ruger make fine handguns and seem to have a model for just about everyone. Revolvers are easier to operate and maintain but are limited to the number of rounds they hold. In most cases the 5-7 rounds should be enough if you know how to fire the pistol well. With practice semi autos are a fine choice, they are more complex but not to a level that they are difficult to shoot or maintain. Most semi autos will provide a higher capacity of ammo between reloands and reloading is far quicker if you purchase an extra mag. I own both revolvers and semi autos and could make a case for either. It comes down to personal choice.<br /><br />Best advice is to take the time and find a pistol that fits you well and then shoot on a regular basis to improve your skill and expereince with your firearm.",

        "content": "Difficult to give you an answer without some additional information, however if the gun is to be used by more than one person, you should pick a gun that is easily used by the least experienced person. For most, that is a revolver in a medium caliber like 38/357. I suggest a 4&quot; barrel and grips should be selected to fit the smallest hands. The 38/357 caliber allows you to learn with light 38 loads and work up to whatever level you want in 38+p and 357 magnum. The price of ammo is about as good as it gets these days for centerfire ammo.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with selecting a semi-auto as long as you and your wife are willing to put in the time to learn to shoot, clear jams, reload and understand all the functions of a semi-auto. I have been an NRA instructor for over 20 years and the vast majority of my students were beginners who quickly learned to shoot a revolver. Many were overwhelmed with the manual of arms for a semi-auto. If you pick a gun your wife likes to shoot, you will have a shooting partner. If you don't, you will have an observer.",

I don't have to check to see if it's the right caliber.<br /> 4. I don't hit my neighbor in the next booth, or myself, with spent brass.<br /> 5. I don't lose (misplace) magazines.<br /> 6. I don't have to load magazines, and my thumbs are happy.<br /> 7. I don't have to clear jams.<br /> 8. I like making the guys shooting the wimpy 9mm guns jump when my .357 or .44 mag goes off!<br /> 9. I've been through the &quot;spray and pray&quot; phase in my younger days, and now rely on shot placement to get the job done.<br />10. You don't go through your ammo as fast, and you get to enjoy more time shootin'.<br />11. I don't have to remember how to take the blasted slide off and disassemble the gun to clean it. Too many pieces.<br />12. I don't have to put all those pieces back together.<br />13. Cleaning a revolver is easy, and they are all the same.<br />14. It takes three seconds to disassemble a single action revolver, and you've only got three parts: frame, cylinder, and pin.<br />15. The grip is always a nice, comfortable size because you don't have a magazine running through the middle of it.<br />16. You can completely change the looks and feel of the gun by changing grips: rubber, wood (so many to choose from), ivory, micarta, smooth, checkered, finger grooves, gunfighter, etc., etc., etc.<br />17. And not only is it &quot;All American&quot; but it's intimidating as hell when you pull out a N-frame S&amp;W, or a Colt Anaconda, or a big mama Ruger SA or DA revolver. Something about a revolver just says, &quot;Bubba, I'm about to put a hole through you big enough to park my pick up.&quot;<br />18. When pointed at someone, they can SEE that cylinder full of ash trays 'bout to come their way, and they'll believe that story about the pick up.<br />19. I know my .41 mag, .44 mag, .357 mag, .44 Sp., or .45 Colt will accomplish #17. The only automatic round that will do the job right is the All American .45 ACP (thank you John Moses Browning). I hear the 10mm ain't half bad, and S&amp;W makes a revolver for that, too.",

        "title": "A Pair Of 75th Anniversary Browning Hi-Power's",
        "content": "I’ve been wanting a Browning Hi-Power for quite a long time. Admittingly it hasn’t been way up on my list, because the version I wanted just seemed a little hard to come by for some reason. Like so many pistols, Browning has gone with quicker to manufacture, lower cost options. I wanted a polished blued finish with checkered Walnut grips. For the last several years the only new versions of this handgun I’ve come across were either matte finished, or else had the even cheaper black Polycoat finish, which is nothing more than a high tech paint job. Most also had cheap, plastic grips instead of the much nicer checkered Walnut versions.<br /><br />The other day I got an E-Mail from Davidson’s showing some of their “New Arrivals” they currently had in stock, and I came across these beautiful 75th Anniversary Edition Browning Hi-Powers. They offered them in a beautiful highly polished, rich blued finish with both Target Adjustable, as well as fixed sights. They also have the original select Walnut checkered grips. And as if that wasn’t enough, both versions were on sale until the end of this month! I promptly ordered 2. One with adjustable sights, and the other with fixed. My local shop called me yesterday morning to let me know they had arrived. I immediately drove over and picked them both up!<br /><br />What I really liked about these 75th Anniversary Edition Models is the fact they not only retain the original bright blued finish with the Walnut grips, but they both have very tasteful roll engraving on the top of the slide stating “75th Anniversary - 1935-2010”. The roll marking is very sharp and clean looking. I’m glad they kept it subdued instead of going with an overpriced, fully pimped, “Barbecue Gun” to commemorate this Model’s 75th Anniversary. This gun costs no more than a similar, non commemorative Hi-Power, and can be shot without damaging any of it’s value if the shooter chooses to do so. Yet it still retains the roll marking which distinguishes it from the standard models. <br /><br />What really impresses me about this gun is the fact it was one of the first of the double stack Hi-Cap 9 MM pistols, and today it’s still one of the best. In a modern age with everyone and their brother offering double stack, Hi-Cap nines, the Browning Hi-Power is still as graceful, well made, and solid as ever. These guns could go up against any of the newer Tupperware versions from Glock and H&amp;K and still hold their own in the performance department. Not bad from a gun that first was designed in 1935. This was John Browning’s last design. In fact he died before a lot of the finishing touches were put on the gun. That alone makes it well worth owning.

Recoil is all but non existant because of the guns soild weight and massive frame for a 9 MM. All of my shooting was at 25 yards. The adjustable sights required no adjustment to bring them in. The gun printed beautifully with a 6:00 O'Clock hold. <br /><br />These weapons double tap phenomimonally. The front sight hardly jumps at all if you maintain a good grip. I even went to my clubs rifle range and had at it at the 200 yard steel gong with these guns. It was no trouble ringing 24&quot; steel gongs at that distance with standard 115 Gr, FMJ bullets. I simply held about 12&quot; inches over the very top of the Target. If you're looking for a solid 9 MM the Browning Hi-Power is the way to go!

        "content": "billt,<br /><br />Congratulations on getting a beautiful pair of pistols. I was fortunate enough to be able to get a Browning Hi-Power quite a few years back that was manufactured in 1986. It was manufactured in Herstal, Belgium, and had fixed sights. It is nearly the spitting image of your fixed sight model, I believe, with the only exceptions being your <span style=\"font-style: italic\">75th Year Scroll</span> and ambidextrous safety.<br /><br />Just wanted to show you how similar they are. I hope you enjoy shooting yours, as much as I enjoy shooting mine. Although it may not look it, I've literally put thousands of rounds through mine ... probably the most trouble free pistol I've ever owned.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://i39.photobucket.com/albums/e172/RuffBuff43/LIS%20Photos/HighPowerLeft.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />",

These are very accurate guns that are often used in competition, especially the Rugers. I have a S&amp;W 41 and an old High Standard Supermatic Trophy Military which are the standards all others were compared to at one time. The High Standard is no longer made though they can be readily found on the used racks. Another good gun is the Colt Woodsman which is also no longer made. In revolvers I would look at the S&amp;W 17, Ruger Single Six, and the hunting model from Taurus (sorry but I don't know the model name/number). Except for a new S&amp;W 41, they should all be under your $600 dollr maximum. I would stick with the .22 LR chamberings as ammo is very inexpensive and accurate enough at handgun ranges.",

If you want my advice, leave the CCW until you can take a good centerfire carry weapon and empty the magazine or cyl. into at least the 9 ring - every time you shoot. Practice both slow fire and rapid fire. If you throw a round off target - start over.<br /><br />Being very new to pistols and believing you're ready to CCW will get you killed.",

        "content": "I agree with what everyone has said. Training with the handgun, pistol or revolver, is much more important at this stage than a CCW permit. In fact, based on your statement, you may not qualify for a permit in many States. Having said that, taking the time to find a gun you like and shoot well is important.<br /><br />If you take the time to learn semi-auto guns, so you know how to clear jams, load, unload, reload and fully operate the gun, then try a semi, but don't forget about a revolver just because it isn't cool or doesn't carry enough ammo.<br /><br />And last, there is no one perfect handgun for all occasions, so you may want to consider a couple of guns, small and larger. The one benefit of a revolver may be that you can find a smaller gun that can do the job year round and maintain decent power.<br /><br />Owning and carrying a gun is serious business. Carrying is easy. Learning to shoot is also easy and fun. But, learning when, where, how and why to shoot or not to shoot when armed with your CCW is a very difficult thing to learn. Take your time, go slow and don't become a public liability.",

I got to hold off buying until after the next gunshow though since you never know, might be a good deal at it. Wont have to wait too much since the next gunshow is Oct 7 &amp; 8 <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /> <br /> <br />On a side note: Did get to put some rounds down range with my .30-06 after the show and tried to with my AR, but had some disappointing issues with it.",

I passed on that gun but somebody bought it when it went on a moving sale for 5% off. They are probably equal for dealer cost but the Kimber name gets a premium price on the shelf due to past reputation. Kimber is more of an assembly line operation now than the near custom shop they used to be.",

        "content": "I bought a Taurus model 17MBCH chambered in .17 HMR (see Page 24. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.taurususa.com/gun-search.cfm\">http://www.taurususa.com/gun-search.cfm</a><!-- m -->) three years ago. I wanted a small revolver as a backup and I am very impressed with the .17HMR. This revolver carries 8 rounds, is “hammer-less”, and is fairly lightweight. When it arrived I ran to the local indoor range to see how it would perform. I went through the first 8 without a problem. I reloaded and fired until the third round when I noticed a dramatic increase in the amount of trigger pull. It fired once more and locked up! I had to wait 20 minutes until it cooled down enough to open the cylinder. I ended up “tapping” the ejector rod on the table top to extract the spent cases and live ammo. Since that event it has been to the Taurus factory and returned to me three times. It still does the same trick, I can't get beyond the twelfth round before it locks up. So far I've spent more than $100 in shipping fees and now I'm looking at sending it back for good. That's another $30!!! I'm going to write Taurus a note telling them how I feel about the quality of their “fine” products. I doubt they will give me my money back, more than likely I will get a coupon good for redemption towards the purchase of another “fine” Taurus product. I will post their response here provided I get an answer. <br />Anyone want to buy a paperweight that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">looks</span> like a gun?",

So it was not a candidate for carrying concealed.<br />The only Beretta I could find chambered in HMR. 17 is a rifle.<br />The same applies to Springfield Armory and H&amp;K, no pistol in HMR .17.

While it most likely wouldn't put an attacker down I'm sure it would get their attention. I used to own two rifles chambered in HMR .17 and I was impressed with their performance until Remington recalled their rifle. Seems like Remington didn't do their homework on this one.",

Only 50 rounds through it so far, but no problems of any kind except perhaps getting adjusted to a 1911 again after being away from the model for 25+ years. I was a competitive pistol shooter (NRA bullseye) for years, but because of department requirements I was forced to use, teach and carry Glocks.<br /><br />I find the gun to be well made and tight. Accuracy was not exceptional but I wasn't really doing an accuracy test, just a light break-in. Generally 2-3&quot; group at 15-20 yds. I am looking forward to further break-in shooting sessions. When I get another 200 rounds through it I should have a better idea of the guns true capabilities and any problems it may have.<br /><br />I bought the gun after considering several other manufacturers. Prices ranged all over the place. I paid $625+tax and felt it was a good deal. I do admit I was looking for a more traditional version of the 1911 rather than one of the more modern versions. Specifically I wanted a standard GI type guide rod and spring rather than the full length version that seems to be so popular these days. If I decide to modify this gun with a beaver tail grip safety, hammer and perhaps different sights, I believe this is a good model to start with. I also liked the fact that the gun is built entirely in the US (I think). I looked at several Kimbers, but the one I liked, with the characteristics I wanted, was over $1300.<br /><br />I think the gun is well made and a solid buy even at the MSRP. The difference between the series 70 or 80 is not an issue with me as I have owned and fired both and find no real differences. IMO, if you buy one you will like it.",

        "title": "A Pair Of 75th Anniversary Browning Hi-Power's",
        "content": "I’ve been wanting a Browning Hi-Power for quite a long time. Admittingly it hasn’t been way up on my list, because the version I wanted just seemed a little hard to come by for some reason. Like so many pistols, Browning has gone with quicker to manufacture, lower cost options. I wanted a polished blued finish with checkered Walnut grips. For the last several years the only new versions of this handgun I’ve come across were either matte finished, or else had the even cheaper black Polycoat finish, which is nothing more than a high tech paint job. Most also had cheap, plastic grips instead of the much nicer checkered Walnut versions.<br /><br />The other day I got an E-Mail from Davidson’s showing some of their “New Arrivals” they currently had in stock, and I came across these beautiful 75th Anniversary Edition Browning Hi-Powers. They offered them in a beautiful highly polished, rich blued finish with both Target Adjustable, as well as fixed sights. They also have the original select Walnut checkered grips. And as if that wasn’t enough, both versions were on sale until the end of this month! I promptly ordered 2. One with adjustable sights, and the other with fixed. My local shop called me yesterday morning to let me know they had arrived. I immediately drove over and picked them both up!<br /><br />What I really liked about these 75th Anniversary Edition Models is the fact they not only retain the original bright blued finish with the Walnut grips, but they both have very tasteful roll engraving on the top of the slide stating “75th Anniversary - 1935-2010”. The roll marking is very sharp and clean looking. I’m glad they kept it subdued instead of going with an overpriced, fully pimped, “Barbecue Gun” to commemorate this Model’s 75th Anniversary. This gun costs no more than a similar, non commemorative Hi-Power, and can be shot without damaging any of it’s value if the shooter chooses to do so. Yet it still retains the roll marking which distinguishes it from the standard models. <br /><br />What really impresses me about this gun is the fact it was one of the first of the double stack Hi-Cap 9 MM pistols, and today it’s still one of the best. In a modern age with everyone and their brother offering double stack, Hi-Cap nines, the Browning Hi-Power is still as graceful, well made, and solid as ever. These guns could go up against any of the newer Tupperware versions from Glock and H&amp;K and still hold their own in the performance department. Not bad from a gun that first was designed in 1935. This was John Browning’s last design. In fact he died before a lot of the finishing touches were put on the gun. That alone makes it well worth owning.

        "content": "Well they shoot great! Not one FTF or FTE. These are nice guns and perform as expected. Recoil is all but non existant because of the guns soild weight and massive frame for a 9 MM. All of my shooting was at 25 yards. The adjustable sights required no adjustment to bring them in. The gun printed beautifully with a 6:00 O'Clock hold. <br /><br />These weapons double tap phenomimonally. The front sight hardly jumps at all if you maintain a good grip. I even went to my clubs rifle range and had at it at the 200 yard steel gong with these guns. It was no trouble ringing 24&quot; steel gongs at that distance with standard 115 Gr, FMJ bullets. I simply held about 12&quot; inches over the very top of the Target. If you're looking for a solid 9 MM the Browning Hi-Power is the way to go! These are some pictures I took in bright Sun after they were cleaned up.

        "content": "billt,<br /><br />Congratulations on getting a beautiful pair of pistols. I was fortunate enough to be able to get a Browning Hi-Power quite a few years back that was manufactured in 1986. It was manufactured in Herstal, Belgium, and had fixed sights. It is nearly the spitting image of your fixed sight model, I believe, with the only exceptions being your <span style=\"font-style: italic\">75th Year Scroll</span> and ambidextrous safety.<br /><br />Just wanted to show you how similar they are. I hope you enjoy shooting yours, as much as I enjoy shooting mine. Although it may not look it, I've literally put thousands of rounds through mine ... probably the most trouble free pistol I've ever owned.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://i39.photobucket.com/albums/e172/RuffBuff43/LIS%20Photos/HighPowerLeft.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />",
