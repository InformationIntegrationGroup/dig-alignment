There is a few scratches around the screw the barrel pivots on. Cabelas offered $600 for it. Is that reasonable? Thanks.",

        "content": "Hi,<br /><br />Does anyone have exact factory production totals for the 6.5mm and .350 magnums in the 1969 BDL's? It's usually stated as about 1500 of each, but I've also seen very specific numbers (but from questionable sources). Does the RSA research team have any real numbers from Remington? As of this week I have as-new examples of both and would like to be more exact about their rarity. More broadly, if we have real production stats on the collectible guns and rarer calibers, can we post them permanently somewhere on the site? John Lacy's excellent book has specifics on 721/722/725 production, but the later guns seem to be more of a mystery or estimate. I know Billy has written a lot about 600/660 production - it would be great to have the knowledge base readily available, if it exists.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Chris",

        "content": "Hey all, only my second time to post to the forum here, but I keep returning because this is such a great souce of information on all things Remington.<br /> I recently came into possession of a barrel and have no freaking clue what it was for. I suspected it may be a conversion sleeve to convert a shotgun to a rifle caliber, but it was only a guess. I tried to drop it down the barrel of a break open 12 gauge that I have in my collection, but the shoulder wouldn’t go past the rebate of the chamber that holds the shell from dropping all the way through. Then I noticed the small numbers stamped on one side near the chamber (as seen in one of the pics below), and thought maybe it was for a 10 gauge shotgun. Still had no idea what gun it was for though. The guy we got this barrel from was a big Parker Bros collector, so that was my first guess. Still only a guess. I can’t ask him because we got it from his wife since he died a couple years ago. She was cleaning out his old wood shop and called us first since we bought a few guns from the estate. Anyway, after doing a little research, it looks to possibly be for the Remington 1882. The only markings I’ve found on it are seen in one of the pics below, and it measures 30 1/8” in overall length. After finding very limited info on this thing on the web, I found one pic that resembles what I have, and that person stated that they were made as a conversion from 10 gauge to two different rifle calibers; 38-55 and 45-70 Gov’t. I tried the 45-70 and would not fit. I don’t have a 38-55 cartridge to test, so I resorted to looking up the cartridge dimensions on Wiki, measured the chamber diameter and rim diameter, and the numbers almost confirm this so far. Bore diameter measured at the lands comes to about .393” and measured at the grooves is about .400”. Anyone out there familiar with what I have? Thank you so much in advance!<br />Mike",

        "content": "What can I learn about my RB from its barrel band markings? First a little bit about the gun.<br /><br />My RB is a Type 1 “Transformed” with the earliest variant breechblock that has the small plate added to it to give it “ears.” There are no steps on the side of the receiver. It has the standard two-line patent stamp. Ed Hull has suggested that it might have been sold to France for the Franco-Prussian war. The proof and inspector’s stamps on the bottom side of the barrel indicate that the RB passed through Belgium sometime between 1877 and 1892 where I’m guessing it was re-barreled. The upper and lower tangs are stamped with the letter ‘C’ and the number 93348. A chamber casting indicates that it is chambered for 11x59R French Gras (or so the gunsmith says). The bottom of the barrel has the number 10.6 stamped into it.<br /><br />The barrel bands are of the solid type, retained by spring clips attached to the forestock. The front barrel band has a crown stamped into it (see pictures). This crown is slightly different in style than the ones on the Greek RB shown on pages 83-85 in George Layman’s book. The cross on the crown in Layman’s book appears different than what we see here: the crown on the Greek RB seems to be splayed out more along the horizontal axis, and the design of the cross atop the crown appears to be different. In fact, to my eye it’s more of a star than a cross atop the crown on my RB (but there may be no historical precedent for stars atop crowns so I’m not pushing my opinion here). The crown on my front barrel band (and it is the only crown on the gun) looks very much like the crown shown at <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.theopenrange.net/forum/index.php?topic=6174.0\">http://www.theopenrange.net/forum/index ... pic=6174.0</a><!-- m -->. Someone commented on that site that the crown was a Danish crown, but the Danish crown has four lobes, not three. I’m not so certain it’s Danish. Does this crown reveal anything about the history of my RB?<br /><br />The middle and rear barrel bands are stamped with the letters ‘DB’ as shown in the attached pictures. Any ideas? Has anyone seen this before?<br /><br />I should also mention that there is no stamp on the sling attachment ring that is part of the middle barrel band.<br /><br />Thanks for any help.<br />Don",

A French document (Puaud &amp; Mery p.263) says the same cartridge was used in the Remington Spanish, Peabody and Berdan Russian I rifles--the .42 Russian will chamber in the .43 Spanish rifles.<br />It is my THEORY that Remington interrupted the manufacture of the Greek contract rifles and had the chambers made in .43 Egyptian before shipment to France. Most of the Greek Model were shipped in Feb-Mar, 1871, so they had not been completed in 1870. Documentation shows that some Greek Model rifles were already made in the original caliber--these later had the chamber bored out, a sleeve inserted (braised in place?) and were rechambered in .43 Spanish before delivery. Maybe France made a separate accounting of Greek Model rifles only because their price was different?<br />Can you send me a copy if the entire list, from which you pictured a small part? Or send me the link to the Internet location? The version in Puaud &amp; Mery p.267 is hard to read.<br />Regards, Ed",

She is all matching serial number 381 nickle plated but does have replacement grips on her. I am posting a few pics I hope and hope you all can help me out. I do plan on shooting from time to time at my local CASS matches. <br />Thanks Billy",

This seems like the right place <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /><br /><br />It has XG on the side of the barrel so i assume this is a 1917 made gun?<br />Serial number is 1525866 and the barrel has the same serial number.<br />It has a scene of a duck landing in a marsh with weeds on the left side and a walking pheasant walking in a field on the right side.<br />The front stock is round on the bottom<br />It has fine checkering on the front stock and the rear stock<br /><br />All the metal is in excellent shape and I know its all original, my grandfather bought it new and my father never messed with it.<br />It looks like it was made very recently.<br /><br />Any info would be a great help, thanks.",

I found a new bolt body at Numrich. once the part came in I was amazed at how worn down this part had become. works like new now.",

        "content": "I know this is out of my area of expertise but the entire line of these rifles were really fussy when it came to feeding from magazines. It may be an over simplification but find another original magazine or two, they aren't cheap but it's probably the best solution.<br /><br />I love to digress but when I was coaching an Air Force Reserve team we had a whole bunch of 513T and other 500 Line rifles. We rarely used the magazines but on those occasions when it was required about one out of three wouldn't feed properly. After a hour or so of switching them from rifle to rifle we had all but one feeding properly. The same held true for rifles like the Winchester 69a, 75, &amp; 52.............they were fussy about magazines and once you started messing with them like bending the ears or whatever they just got worse!!! <br /><br />Keep checking Ebay and the auction sites, you will find one eventually.<br /><br />Jim Peterson<br />Charlotte, NC",

        "content": "Hello:<br /><br />Once you know exactly which version of the Remington Rolling Block rifle you have (military or civilian), your dovetail questions should be easy to answer. If you do not know exactly which gun you have, the folks at Rolling Block Parts can probably tell you which one you have. Then, either they, or the folks at Montana Vintage Arms can tell you the dovetail widths, depths, and distances apart. Most dovetail inserts/mounts have to be fitted, depending the age and other factors of your old rifle. Therefore, folks at Montana Vintage Arms make their dovetail inserts .003 larger than you request. This bit of extra metal to allow you to do that last bit of custom fitting (and possibly some touch-up cold bluing if you knick something in the process). Some rolling block versions have screw-on/bolt-on front and rear barrel sights to be attached to tapped barrels, while others have dovetails to be inserted into barrels (with an occasional set-screw to hold the dovetail in place). Some have no tapped holes or dovetail for a rear barrel sight at all because they were fitted only with a rear tang sight, etc, etc.<br /><br />Two recommendations:<br /><br />Contact <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.rollingblockparts.com\">www.rollingblockparts.com</a><!-- w --> They see so many old Remington Rolling Blocks (including every type of military and civilian style) that they should be able to give you standard sizes for your dovetails.<br /><br />Contact <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.montanavintagearms.com\">www.montanavintagearms.com</a><!-- w --> They machine and manufacture dovetail and screw-on/bolt-on sight and scope mounts for all styles of antique and modern rolling block rifles. Extremely high accuracy machining. They should know exact dovetail tolerances and can even custom manufacture for you if your dovetail is not standard.<br /><br />Hope this helps.",

        "content": "Philippe, thanks for the very good photos.<br /> I believe the Greek Sabre is the same as the Chassepot, but made in Germany where Remington got all of its similar saber bayonets. Remington called them the Greek Sabre to tell the difference from the Egyptian Sabre (which has not extra little mortice). They shipped so many more Greek Sabre bayonets than Greek Model rifles because the French could also use the bayonets on their Chassepot rifles. When the Remington Greek rifles were sold without bayonets in 1873 &amp; 78 the bayonets were probably kept for use on the Chassepot rifles. See Puaud/Mery book, pages 232-3. The only way a collector could identify a likely Greek Sabre bayonet is by finding a German made Chassepot bayonet with no serial number, likely made by Alex Coppel or Kirschbaum (from which Remington bought Egyptian Sabres).<br /><br /> The saber bayonet in photo no. 2 is what Remington called the “American Saber.” It has a ribbed grip on the hilt. Janzen (no. 4-4) calls it the Remington Export, I call it the 1870 Remington Export because it was made for only a very short time in that period. Puaud/Mery picture it on page 183.<br /><br /> There were no U.S. Navy Model 1870 Sword Bayonets shipped to France with the M1870 Navy rifles. Navy and Springfield Armory records are clear that the Navy did not sell bayonets with the rifles. Records show that Remington obtained and shipped 10,000 “Navy Sabres” at the same time as the rifles were shipped. Just as in the fact that most M1870 Navy rifles shipped to France were not inspected by the Navy, the “Model 1870” bayonets that Remington obtained were also not inspected--the Navy did not inspect weapons for commercial sale. The only type of bayonet which fits the M1870 rifle that is uninspected is the type with the yataghan blade; the straight blade types always show Navy inspection. Later these “Remington M1870” bayonets were likely sold as surplus to Mexico after the war.<br /><br /> The story of these various 1870 Remington bayonets will be published in the next journal of the American Society of Bayonet Collectors.<br /><br /> Thank you for the dates of the surplus rifle sales: 6,640 + 9,202= 15,842 but Remington records show they shipped only 15,000.<br /><br /> In the photo of the three saber bayonets, the type with fish scale hilt on either side of the M1870 are the Ames Export, Janzen 4-1. The first record of the sale of these is in the late 1870s, well after the F-P War. They are more common than the 1870 Remington Export.",

        "content": "Hi Philippe,<br />Ed, I don't know if you had this done previously, but if not, I wonder if it might help if someone on the coming RSA research team trip could measure the diameter of the muzzle areas of the Greek example in the Remington archive room, and then perhaps you could compare the inner diameters of all bayonet examples that you obtain information on? In addition, though I know the presence of the tenon would make it difficult, but if it could somehow be determined if a standard Egyptian saber bayonet would at least give an indication to fit the museum's Greek rifle might also be of interest. For some reason I get the feeling that like several other pieces in the Remington archive collection, (i.e. examples of Argentine and Egyptian Models in the non-standard .50 caliber etc.) that the brass tag #117 Greek model in Ilion is a pre-production prototype or tool room pattern model that didn't go into production as intended. Hence, a reason why no collectors in France (at least to my knowledge) have ever uncovered a Remington Greek Model or another Remington made rolling block with the identical tenon feature. In a somewhat related matter, these .43 Egyptian rifles with the KM markings, seem to be among the earliest in this caliber and two of the dozen or so known, also have a faint J.O.B. cartouche as well. Hope this is of assistance.<br /><br />George",

Or, it could have been .43 Egyptian and later altered to one of the other .42/.43 cartridges.<br /><br />It predates August of 1870 when the design of the breechblock changed and can't be one of the Egyptian pattern rifles that went to France because all of the 1st contract Egyptian rifles (with the concave breechblock) went to Egypt.... they were delivered 6 months before the Franco-Prussian War began. The story that they were diverted to France is a myth - although a later Egyptian order may have been.<br /><br />The serial number on the butt as illustrated above is a very Spanish convention.",

Do not need it, but price was too good to pass up. It has the one line barrel address REMINGTON ARMS CO ILION NY USA on the top of barrel, 22 RF just forward of the forearm, buffalo horn insert in schnabel tip, and SN of 397XX. Any way to tell what year this was made? One guy at the gunshow thought it was an early model due to the &quot;cheeks&quot; on stock where it meets back of receiver. Thanks!",

        "content": "Hello.<br />I'm new here but not at all new to firearms. Recently I acquired a Rem mod 721 (.270) from a friend after his 98 year old father died. Apparently his father bought this rifle new. From what I have scoured up on it, it is all original. Fortunately there have been no amateurish alterations to this rifle. in fact, it has never even had a scope mounted on it. The chamber and throat are clean with very little wear, and the barrel and crown are the same. I believe this rifle has been carried a lot more than it has been shot. <br /><br />I had entertained thoughts of robbing the action and making a custom shooter from it but I must admit that I have a soft spot for a &quot;classic&quot; rifle, And this thing has history. So I will give it a respectful restoration. <br /><br />I am curious however of the date of manufacture. Based on the barrel stamping and internet searching I have come to believe it is a 1961 production. The last year of production I believe. But it is the only one I have seen that does not have the barrel swell below the rear sight. Am I correct in my deduction?<br /><br />Barrel stamp reads:<br /><br />0H 32",

Recently I acquired a Rem mod 721 (.270) from a friend after his 98 year old father died. Apparently his father bought this rifle new. From what I have scoured up on it, it is all original. Fortunately there have been no amateurish alterations to this rifle. in fact, it has never even had a scope mounted on it. The chamber and throat are clean with very little wear, and the barrel and crown are the same. I believe this rifle has been carried a lot more than it has been shot. <br /><br />I had entertained thoughts of robbing the action and making a custom shooter from it but I must admit that I have a soft spot for a &quot;classic&quot; rifle, And this thing has history. So I will give it a respectful restoration. <br /><br />I am curious however of the date of manufacture. Based on the barrel stamping and internet searching I have come to believe it is a 1961 production. The last year of production I believe. But it is the only one I have seen that does not have the barrel swell below the rear sight. Am I correct in my deduction?<br /><br />Barrel stamp reads:<br /><br /><strong>0H</strong> 32</div></td><td class=\"bb-right\"><img src=\"images/spacer.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"4\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></td></tr><tr><td width=\"4\" height=\"4\" class=\"bb-left-bot\"><img src=\"images/spacer.gif\" width=\"4\" height=\"4\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></td><td width=\"100%\" class=\"bb-bot\"><img src=\"images/spacer.gif\" width=\"4\" height=\"4\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></td><td width=\"4\" height=\"4\" class=\"bb-right-bot\"><img src=\"images/spacer.gif\" width=\"4\" height=\"4\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></td></tr></table></div><br /><br />You are correct. It's 1961. I have a 721 in .264 Win Mag with a &quot;D H&quot; date code and it doesn't have the barrel &quot;hump&quot; either.<br />Other than cleaning some crud out of the bolt, having the trigger lightened by a qualified gunsmith (it was about 6 lbs. when I got it) and adding bases and scope, I haven't altered mine. I wanted to keep it &quot;as close to original&quot; as possible. It had been used, but not abused. I've had a couple of other 721s and 722s that were so &quot;butt ugly&quot; that I felt some &quot;enhancements&quot; weren't going to hurt their value, but otherwise, I've tried to keep mine as close to original as possible......even though I don't plan on selling them in my lifetime.<br /><br /><br />Den<br /><br />.",

        "content": "Hello.<br />This is my first post on the forum. Thank you in advance for your wisdom and consideration. I am looking for a tang sight for a Remington Arms Co. No. 1 1/2 in 32 Short/Long rimfire blackpowder. Serial number is 3007. Originally great grandfather's. Want to pass down to nephew with a tang sight included.<br /><br />The original filler screws are still in the tang. Anyone know the original or new Lyman, Vernier, or Marbles tang sights for this rifle? Sight base letter or number and sight upper part number or model number would be very helpful.<br /><br />My initial measurement of the tang sight screws was 1.95&quot; C to C. Hoping to find a midrange sight with both elevation and windage to allow for teaching my nephew the use of the old-style sight. Note that both the original front blade and rear buckhorn sights are currently dovetailed on the rifle.<br /><br />Found some reloadable 32 Short/Long rimfire cartridges from H&amp;C in the UK (primers must come from the USA though).<br /><br />Any tang sights out there? Thanks to everyone for your help and enthusiasm for old rolling blocks!",

While the .42 Russian cartridges were used extensively as a replacement for the .43 Spanish by the French ordnance department (the .42 conveniently fits the Spanish Model chamber) that is not the Greek Model caliber. Originally the Greek Model was chambered in .43 Greek. But when Remington diverted the Greek rifles to France it was easy to ream out the chambers to the longer .43 Egyptian. I hope to tell this story in more detail in a future RSA journal article. Your rifle with the &quot;G&quot; mark appears to be a Spanish Model, which shows that this mark does not mean Greek Model.

        "content": "Hello Philippe,<br />Regarding the .43 Greek cartridge, I have a copy of an 1878-1880 UMC broadsheet, which displays this cartridge alongside both the .42 Berdan and .43 Spanish, as well as the .43 Egyptian cartridges. In reality, the .43 Greek is a secondary nomenclature of the 1874 French 11mm Gras cartridge. This came about simply because the Greek designed, single-shot Mylonas rifle was chambered for the French Gras cartridge, and for reasons unknown, the cartridge was soon coined the .43 Greek. The Mylonas somewhat copies a rolling block style action, thus the UMC broadsheet also mentions that the .43 Greek is intended for the &quot;Grecian Remington&quot; rifles. Interestingly, not long after the Mylonas rifle was dropped, Greece also adopted the French Gras rifle as well. It would be impossible that that the original 1869/70 Greek Remington rifle used in the Franco Prussian War, could have been chambered for the so called .43 Greek cartridge as this round was introduced long after (four years) following the F/P war to include having been developed in France. In my book on pages 83-84, is a Greek model Remington that was removed from the French Engineer and Artillery Museum School Museum by the occupying Germans in 1940 and was brought back from a Nazi depository in Augsburg, Germany to the United States in 1945 by a US Army ordnance officer. This particular rifle would accept only the .42 Berdan cartridge following close examination during our photo session at the publishers studio. At least eight out of some 20 or more identically marked Greek models I have previously owned such as yours with the crowns, and the Circle G cartouche, accepted only the .42 Berdan and not the .43 Spanish. Being that your rifle remained in Europe since the war of 1870 ( I am assuming it remained in Europe), .....please try to at least obtain a .43 Spanish cartridge and fit it to your rifle. It is my feeling that it will protrude close to 1/8 of an inch...Simply because only those Greek contract rifles viewed thus far which returned to the US had their chambers &quot;throated&quot; or rather &quot;bushed&quot; in this country to .43 Spanish for resale to the Latin American <br />market. In essence, those which never were re-exported to the United States, such as yours, should indeed have remained in the original .43 Berdan chambering. Hoping this may be of assistance.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />George Layman",

        "content": "Philippe,<br />One last item I neglected to mention. The possibility also exists that your Greek marked Remington may be in .43 Egyptian...Looking a bit closer at the open breech, the chamber appears to be much larger than the normal .579 diameter base of either the .42 Berdan / .43 Spanish cartridges. Additionally, the J.O.B cartouche on the left butt is often, if not most often, found on Greek models that were rechambered to the very popular .43 Egyptian cartridge which accounts for the majority of the rolling block calibers received by France in the War of 1870-71. Look closely for an &quot;E&quot; beneath the forearm on the middle band, or elsewhere on the stock. This appears to indicate such rifles were converted from .42 Berdan to .43 Egyptian, giving a hint so to speak to French logistics personnel. I have one of the Greek marked variations in the .43 Egyptian chambering and is in identical &quot;bright finish&quot; and condition. Do not however neglect to inspect the caliber of the other G marked rifle (without the bayonet lug), and do try to obtain a .43 Spanish cartridge for an evaluation on both rifles.<br /><br />George Layman",

        "content": "Hello Philippe and thank you for your reply!<br /> I am happy to hear that you confirmed my suspicions that the your Greek crown marked variant was indeed verified as a re-chamber to the Egyptian cartridge. I am afraid it would be difficult to date a particular rifle as to a shipment. However my own take on this is that once word had gotten to US exporters that the both the .43 Spanish and .42 Russian Berdan cartridge had obviously become a dilemma regarding ammunition interchangeability, thus the wisest course of action would be to simply take the remaining .42 caliber Remington Greek rifles and re-ream the chambers to the larger .43 Egyptian cartridge which was by then, firmly established as perhaps the primary French cartridge as far as Remington rolling block rifles were concerned. My feeling on this though is that such an undertaking must have been accomplished not long before the cessation of hostilities with Germany in May of 1871, simply because a fair number Greek model Remington rolling block rifles in .43 Egyptian caliber have been circulated in the USA for several years, most of which have been in very good, if not near excellent condition. This also could be evidence that a number of the 9,202 rifles in the original .42 Berdan caliber never made it to France, and were part of the once advertised &quot;French Models&quot; shown but once in the 1876 Remington factory broadsheet. The problem here though is<br /> that between 1873 and 1878, supposedly all 9,202 Greek rifles in .42 Berdan caliber were sold at auction in France. With this in mind, it could well mean that these .43 Egyptian chambered Remington Greek rolling blocks were not part of the equation, as a total of 13,500 of the Greek contract Remington rolling blocks was the original specified quantity ordered by Greece in late 1869. Trust me, after 46 years of studying the military rolling block, the Greek version almost appears to be the &quot;rolling block that never was,&quot; overtly due to its appearing in three different calibers at times; a convoluted but detailed story that has mystified all! Anyhow your Circle G marked rifle minus the bayonet lug will be an interesting one to solve...that is after you receive your .42 and .43 caliber cartridges! If it turns out to be chambered in .42 Berdan, it will be the first discovered without a bayonet lug but marked with the ubiquitous G. Incidentally, of those .43 Spanish caliber rolling block rifles shipped to France viewed thus far. all have had two barrel bands and a 30.5&quot; barrel much like a Remington Civil Guard Model...however none had the saber bayonet lug. An example is in my book in the section under France. Anyhow, take care for now Philippe.<br /><br />Best,<br />George Layman",

A total of 21,500 were shipped to France, but French receipts show the lesser number.<br /><br />How can the Remington rifle version with the crown mark be both .42 Berdan and .43 Egyptian and both called the Greek Model? That would be unsupportable in the field. There must be a distinguishing characteristic to be a Greek Model, like always having the bayonet stud bar AND tenon. Also, I have a standard French delivery Egyptian Model with the JOB cartouche (no crown mark), so this is not a distinguishing mark.<br /><br />There were 15,000 Greek Model rifles delivered to France, along with 18,800 Greek saber bayonets. In other words, the bayonet for the Greek Model is unique from the Egyptian Model, so the rifles must have had the original stud bar and tenon.",

We have not yet found a 44-77 under ser 1000 that we can say is definately right. But I would think there may be some in the 900 range. Remington did not offer the 44-77 until the late summer of 1872 and getting towards the end of the roundtops. We believe the octagon receivers started around the first of 1873. You must do the math when buying the roundtops. If the cartridge had not been developed, it is highly unlikely Remington made a rifle in that caliber. Also beware of roundtops in 44-60. At least 2 people have rechambered some in that caliber in the last few years. Ed",

        "username": "RAR45110",
        "title": "58 Caliber Rolling Block",
        "content": "Gentlemen,<br /><br />I would appreciate some help identifying a Remington Rolling Block barreled action that I purchased some time ago at a gun show. The seller was an elderly gentleman who said when I purchased it, &quot;That's all original.&quot; Unfortunately, at the time I failed to ask what it was. I only knew that it was a Remington RB and that is what I have collected. This gun is a 58 caliber with a 39&quot; barrel. The witness marks on the barrel and action line up, so I don't think that the barrel has been replaced. The block has &quot;ears&quot; on either side of it to accommodate the larger cartridge rim, and the action has cutouts on the sides for these &quot;ears&quot; to pass by. I have many Remington RB's and none have this type of block. The extractor is of the sliding type along side the barrel. The block has a screw, from the left to the right, that retains the firing pin. The barrel has the conventional Remington front sight and has the half dovetail slot in the rear with one screw hole. An 1868 Springfield rear sight I have fits perfectly and the stain on the barrel fits that sight shape exactly. The sight screw has the same threads as this barrel. The rear of the dovetail is about 1/4&quot; from the action. The stains on the barrel indicate it had 3 barrel bands. The centerline of the first mark is about 7 1/4 &quot; from the face of the action. The second one is about 19 inches from the action and the third is about 31 5/8 &quot; from the action. These measurements are based on stains on the barrel. The block thumb pieced and the hammer thumb piece are hatched all the way across. The upper tang is about 3 3/8 &quot; from the square of the action and the lower tang (part of the trigger guard) is about 4 1/2&quot; from the square of the action. This is the only RB that I have that has a longer lower tang than the upper tang. The upper tang has the first line imprint (as best as I can read it), Remington Ilion N Y U.S.A. The second line is, PAT. May 3D Nov 15 1864 April 17th 1868. The &quot;D&quot; after the 3 is smaller and superscript to the 3. There is a sling swivel on the front of the trigger guard.<br /><br />I cannot find any information on this rifle and would like to restore it to shootable condition, as I have done with several other RB's I own.<br /><br />Thank you in advance for any help you can give me.<br /><br />Robert Read",

        "content": "You are correct, I should have gotten a Flaydermans years ago, and I do have one on order now. I have looked up specific rifles in the library in Flaydermans at times. Richard, I do have your 58 and 50 caliber rifles book, and I love it! It has helped me greatly in my quest to restore an 1871 Springfield RB. I also have the RB book by Konrad Schreier on RB's. I do find it hard some times to spend money on books when I can spend it on guns. I am a collector of rolling blocks, but not an expert by any means. My collection was started by having the desire to buy old black powder cartridge guns at, back then, low prices, repair them as necessary and shoot them. I regularly shoot my 7mm's, 43 Spanish, and my 22 caliber. I have purchased guns and then looked up information on them rather than learning about all the Rolling Blocks and looking for specific ones to collect. As I said, I was at a gun show where a gun smith, who was apparently retiring, had piled a bunch of gun parts, actions, etc. on tables. He had these guns of all kinds, and most without wood, piled on tables on top of each other, 4 and 5 guns deep. I sorted through and picked up the 58 I am speaking of, two 1870 Springfield Navy RB actions and one 1871 Springfield RB action. All for a couple hundred dollars. I researched the 1871 Springfield and am now restoring it. I have had to become familiar with all the action parts so I can recognize them when they are listed on ebay or gunbroker as unknown parts. Wescomb, who is now owned by Ken Womack, didn't have the parts, and Numrich hasn't had much of anything for years. I now have all the action parts, an 1871 Springfield RB barrel with wood, and barrel bands. It is on its way to Dave Higgenbotham of Lonestar to have the barrel installed correctly in the action. When he is done, I will have everything correct except for the buttstock. It has been difficult finding a buttstock for the 1871. I will use an incorrect one until I find one. With this project of several years approaching a close, I was looking at attacking the 58, which is why I wrote the request. I will purchase Laymans book to see exactly what I will be looking for. I think it will be much harder to find wood for this gun. However, things do turn up from time to time. I thought I might never find all the action parts for the 1871 and I did. I want to thank all of you for your help, especially the pictures of the 58.<br /><br />Thanks again,<br /><br />Robert Read",

My name is Ted, I live in MN, am a dairy farmer by profession and love shooting nice old guns, .22's and black powder guns mostly.<br /><br />I just got registered although I've been lurking here for a while reading all the great info on Remington firearms. One rifle I don't see too much written about is the #2 roller. I like the looks of them and am thinking that I need one someday in .22 rim fire. <br /><br />My question: Is the #2 a small frame rifle or is it a medium sized rifle comparable (in physical size) to say.. a 44 Stevens? I have always been under the impression that a #4 roller was about the size of a Stevens Favorite and the #2 would be about the size of my 44 Stevens. <br /><br />Thanks for any info anyone can give.<br /><br />Ted",

        "content": "Was wondering what you all have come up with for twist rates in your original guns. I get 1: 22 1/4&quot; in my 45-70 NYSM. Checked it 3 times and thats what I get. Odd since I have been shooting 500gr bullets in it with no signs of tumbling on paper at100 or 200. I just loaded a 30 rounds for load development so I will have to pay closer attention to groupings and what the holes look like. I would have thought since these were put together around 1880 that it would have the faster twist for the then new 45-500-70 loading of 1879. Or at least the 1:20 that the early trapdoor had.",

        "content": "Uhhh - not exactly.<br /><br />The earliest trapdoor, the .58 cal &quot;First Allin&quot; M1865, kept the 1:72 twist of the parent musket. <br /><br />The subsequent models of 1866 (a.k.a. &quot;Second Allin&quot;), 1868, and 1870, all in .50-70-450, used 1:42, in both lined (first) and unlined (later) versions. The trials carbine of 1870 was a .50-55-430, and used the same 1:42 twist.<br /><br />The advent of the .45-70-405 round in 1873, brought a change to 1:22 (never 1:20)<br /><br />The long range (.45-80, 2.4&quot; case) testing of 1879-1881 saw experimentation with different bullet weights, up to 550gr., and twists of 1:18, 1:19.625 as well as the then-standard 1:22. This process turned out to be a failure so far as the original premise was concerned, but <strong>did</strong> show that optimum results could be obtained at .45-70-500 in 1:22. This load was then adopted as the service (rifle) standard until end of production in 1893. Carbines, beginning in 1873, were always .45-55-405, also in 1:22.<br /><br />So, there is no reason why 500gr. bullets would have a problem with 1:22 - actually it's quite the opposite.",

The problem is that they do not seem to have been done according to a system - that each unit marked things as it saw fit and some didn't mark them at all. It might be possible to puzzle many of them out but it would require someone collecting data on hundreds, if not thousands of surviving rifles and carbines and comparing their markings to the known NY units. Oddly, I think it could be done because NY rifles have a very high survival rate, but it would be a great deal of work and would take years.",

I'll let the pictures do the talking, but my main question is whether it is possible that the plating and drill and tap was done by the factory. Could the gun have been ordered this way? Could it have been sent back to have this done? Any information on the rifle would be greatly appreciated. <br /><br /><br /><img src=\"http://i280.photobucket.com/albums/kk186/kingpenm3/Mobile%20Uploads/IMG_20150321_123801_zpsozf7yr1z.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br /><img src=\"http://i280.photobucket.com/albums/kk186/kingpenm3/Mobile%20Uploads/IMG_20150321_123154_zpsaq5tzspu.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br /><img src=\"http://i280.photobucket.com/albums/kk186/kingpenm3/Mobile%20Uploads/IMG_20150321_123812_zpsdxlw79fd.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br /><img src=\"http://i280.photobucket.com/albums/kk186/kingpenm3/Mobile%20Uploads/IMG_20150321_123035_zpsrlztotwz.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br /><img src=\"http://i280.photobucket.com/albums/kk186/kingpenm3/Mobile%20Uploads/IMG_20150321_123141_zps9knpn7ol.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br /><img src=\"http://i280.photobucket.com/albums/kk186/kingpenm3/Mobile%20Uploads/IMG_20150321_123126_zpswb7rgeyx.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br /><img src=\"http://i280.photobucket.com/albums/kk186/kingpenm3/Mobile%20Uploads/IMG_20150321_123057_zpsftdysfsp.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br /><img src=\"http://i280.photobucket.com/albums/kk186/kingpenm3/Mobile%20Uploads/IMG_20150321_123107_zpsse65arka.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />",

If it was returned to the factory to have it done it would have a barrel code followed by a &quot;3&quot;. Remington didn't do much in the way of nickel plating during that period, whatever the finish it was done a long time ago and poorly. It almost looks like it was electroplated, been exposed to 500 series rifles for a long time and they have all been blue or Parkerized. I'll bet its fun shooting it outside with the Sun reflecting off the barrel......oh well, its an interesting piece.<br /><br />Hopefully you will get a more educated response from someone!<br /><br />Jim Peterson<br />Charlotte, NC",

I actually own three Remingtons - an 870 Express and two pass-downs from my Grandfather: a 12 Gauge Model 11 and 22 caliber Model 12 pump action rifle. My post here is in reference to the Model 11...<br /><br />My understanding by checking the code stamped on the barrell that this 11A shotgun was manufactured in November of 1932. Please correct me if I'm wrong. <br /><br />But the larger question for me revolves around the numbered stamped UNDERNEATH the barrell (<strong>picture 3</strong>). Excuse me if this is common knowledge around here, and I tried to look up another forum post that goes over this. But just out of curiosity, what exactly do these numbers and letters represent?<br /><br />Thanks...<br /><br /><img src=\"http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a299/Rhilton4u/Firearms/Remington11A_0051.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br /><br /><img src=\"http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a299/Rhilton4u/Firearms/Remington11ABarrellTopSide.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #FF4000\">WHAT DO THESE NUMBERS MEAN?</span><br /><img src=\"http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a299/Rhilton4u/Firearms/Remington11AUndersideBarrell_1.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br /><br /><img src=\"http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a299/Rhilton4u/Firearms/Remington11ABarrellSerial.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br /><br /><img src=\"http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a299/Rhilton4u/Firearms/Model11ASerialNumberInjectionPort.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br /><br /><img src=\"http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a299/Rhilton4u/Firearms/Remington11ABarrellTopside2.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />",

I do not know enough about Model 11s to say if that barrel date matches the serial number date. Or they could be an assembly code, a craftman's inspection code, an assembly code, anything.

        "content": "I ran into a unique old Remington rolling block this weekend and I can't figure out exactly what it is. If anyone could help I would sure appreciate it. This is what I can tell you about it. It has a patent date of 1886 and 1888 on the top rear tang and on the bottom rear tang around the back screw are the numbers 725. It has a normal buttstock with a slight hand swell and deeper than usual crescent butt plate but not as deep as a shuetzen. The forearm is ordinary. Now heres where it gets interesting. The heavy octagon barrel is 45 caliber and is so marked on the underside mid-way up the barrel. This made me think it was rebarreled because I didn'nt think Remington made big bores with the 1886-1888 patent date. But when I removed the foream the same number (725 ) was right there, matching the one on the bottom tang! WHAT AM I LOOKING AT? Hopefully someone much more knowledgeable than me can help me out.<br />Thanks",

That's what puzzles me right now is that you have a low serial but a late patent date. Mine is 16xx and last patent date on the lh side of receiver is 1873.<br /><br />Is there a serial number on the forearm itself. Also, look at the checkering pattern on the hammer and block tab....does it match those in the pics?<br /><br />Looking forward to seeing the rifle.",

        "content": "Is your Rolling Block Remington made or Spanish made? Spain tended to use a slightly larger chamber. Geo. Hoyem, in his &quot;History and Development of Small Arms Ammunition Vol 2&quot; lists the 11mm Reformado as having the following measurements (taken from specimens): base: .519&quot;-.521&quot;. Case mouth (does not list &quot;neck&quot;): .470&quot;-.486&quot;. My own specimens have: base:.519&quot;-.522&quot;. The Reformado has a tapered neck so measurements vary depending on where measured but go from about .481&quot;-.492&quot;. I'm going to guess that your rifle is chambered for the 11mm Reformado. From a lot of experience casting chambers on these rifles I have developed a &quot;theory&quot; that rifles rechambered from 11mm Remington to the Reformado ctg AND done in an armory have fairly uniform chambers. But, due to widely fluctuating chamber measurements I have seen I believe that Spain sent reamers to various outposts where rechambering was done by whoever was available and with whatever tools may have been at hand. Generally, my Reformado chambered rifles that I shoot I have been able to use BELL 11mm Spanish brass (or Bertram or JASS or whatever) and, after the case is fireformed, I neck size only for reloading. I have one rifle with the &quot;Fluer de Lis&quot; on the side of the barrel (indicating it was in the 1st order from Remington) that I had to use BELL 450/400 brass and these had to have the base taken down a little on a lathe until they would chamber. I have yet to see a Uruguay/Francotte that that could be shot with any brass except worked over 450/400 brass. Their chambers are just too large for the 11mm Spanish brass to work. The 1st Rolling Block carbine (11mm Spanish) I bought a lot of years ago was in real nice condition. After the deal was made and I'm walking away the guy who sold it called me back to give me ammo to go with it. It was 80 rounds of 11mm Mannlicher (Werndl) ammo. That should have been my 1st clue. At home an 11mm Spanish ctg got lost in the chamber. At one time Mannlicher ammo was real common here but few rifles to shoot it is. Some folks reamed out Rolling Block chambers to shoot it. Some stamped the barrel &quot;11Mann&quot;, some did not. When dealing with old timey guns remember, a LOT of years have passed since it was made which means that there was ample time for someone to play with or bugger up a chamber.",

From what few I've seen, the engraving looks like what factory engraving should look like.<br /> As for condition; that's not as unusual as you think. If you consider the cost of a Rolling Block Special order Sporting Rifle in that configuration, you'll realise it cost a heck of a lot of money when it was new, and whoever bought it knew it. If you bought a gun today that cost you a couple months pay or more, wouldn't you take excellent care of it, and pass that same knowledge on to your family members so they'd take care of it after your demise?<br /> As for the price....it may be a bit hopeful at $24k, but not that far off for such a fine example.",

        "title": "Trapdoor Remington?",
        "content": "I have what appears to be an Allin Conversion Model 1866 rifle with some interesting variations (to me anyway). It is .50 caliber, dated 1866 over eagle head on the bolt and 1865 on the lock plate. The lock plate also has the eagle crest over U.S. and is further marked with &quot;REMINGTON'S ILION NY&quot;. The blued barrel measures ~32.5&quot; to the breech face and has two barrel bands. The muzzle has a slight annular groove about the bore that I assume is a liner. The stock bears much resemblance to my 1873 Springfield Trapdoor stock as the cross-section dimensions throughout their length are similar. The overall length of the stock (48.5&quot;) and gun (52&quot;) are also the same as the 1873, as is the two-band spacing. So, it does not appear to be a cut-down 3-band version, as the 2-band spacing is correct. There is a faint rectangular-shaped cartouche in the usual place, but is unreadable. It has a 7-groove ramrod and the tang of the buttplate is marked U.S.<br /><br />The gun is in NRA excellent condition. While Flayderman's lends some discussion to shortened-barrel versions of the 1866, there is no discussion of Remington 2-band 1865 contract rifles (only 1861's, made by Remington between 1864-66) or Remington Allin conversions, nor can I find anything in my limited library or on the Internet about Remington trapdoors. This piece resembles a &quot;Zouave Rifle&quot; in many respects as noted above, but differs significantly as well, e.g. no brass furniture and no patchbox.<br /><br />So, what do I have? Is this original and if so, how many were made? Did Remington manufacture a 2-band contract rifle? If so, should I assume this is a Springfield Arsenal Allin conversion, or did Remington manufacture/ convert trapdoors?<br /><br />Thank you.",

        "content": "You appear to possibly have a Springfield M1866 Short Rifle, with a Remington contract lockplate. SA did, around 1870/71, shorten some (around 1100) 3-band 1866s, having excessive muzzle wear/damage, to the 52&quot; length of the current Model 1868. However, this type of work was also done by various outside parties, such as Bannerman, Whitney, etc. Some of these have &quot;ugly&quot; band spacing, as well as excessively thinned wrists.<br /><br />Does your stock have a filled band spring cutout where the old middle band was fitted? Does the cleaning rod screw in, and is it about 1-1/8&quot; from the muzzle when fully stowed?<br /><br />Remington never made trapdoors, however the reverse IS true, since SA did make/assemble several varieties of Remington's rolling block. The 1866 Allin is an interesting gun, which exists in numerous different minor permutations, including built from parts, for sale to the French. To the assemblers, a lockplate was simply a lockplate.",

        "content": "You're welcome, Dave.<br /><br />SA did not make NEW 2-band 1866s. The rifles referred to were shortened due to muzzle damage. The stocks utilized were M1863 type one (which had used clamping bands) so there should be no filled spring cut (you did not respond to that question). The rods on genuine SA-converted short 66s do thread in, just like the full-length rifle, and have a similar set-back when stowed.<br /><br />So, more questions: does your rod have threads? Is there a keeper plate in the stock? You will have to pull the trigger guard to see this. The bottom of the rod hole frequently gets packed full of crud which prevents the rod from going in all the way. In profile, the rod head itself should look just like your 1873.<br /><br />As to the wrist, if it looks like your 1873 it has not been thinned. This abuse usually occurs only on rifles where the middle band was left in its' original position, on non-SA shortened arms.<br /><br />You may find some helpful info on my webpage. Go to <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.picturetrail.com/sa4570af\">http://www.picturetrail.com/sa4570af</a><!-- m -->. My (SA done) short 1866 (purchased from Ed Hull) is not yet pictured, but the other models are. You MIGHT (cheap plug here) even be interested in my book.<br /><br />Several firms apparently made up short 1866s. For years, I had one which was &quot;almost&quot; right, but finally did not pass ALL of the tests. The Remington lock IS a bit of a clue to non-SA assembly, but not necessarily a deal-breaker IF ALL else was right. In any event, AFAIK, Remington themselves did NO such work.",

        "content": "While the emphasis is on the rifles - and I am a Springfield collector, only 'involved' with Remingtons because of the several RBs made at SA in the 1867-72 period - there is an acoutrements chapter. I cannot speak for the transformed rifle, but the .58 cal M1865 &quot;First Allin&quot; used CW pouches, of both 1861 and 1864 pattern, with wooden blocks sitting atop the tin boxes. The first .50-70s used a similar adaptation, before going to the Dyer and Hagner pouches. Some McKeevers (1874) were made in .50-70, and the later Frazier pattern pouch was widely used by those militia/NG troops having .50-70s<br /><br />The book - which was vetted by Roy Marcot and Ed Hull, among others - contains chapters on each of the SA-RBs. I own an 1867 Navy Cadet, both 1870 Navies, an 1870 Trials rifle, and an 1871 Army. I lack (but would like to obtain) a transformed rifle and the Trials carbine. I purposely do not have an 1867 Navy carbine, or the NYS arms, since they were not made at SA.",

I live not to far from Ilion enjoy the history.I have a Remington Keene barreled action 20&quot; barrel in caliber 45-70 for sale. I've had this for several years and was always going to make a project of it some day to restock it and make a fun shooter out of it. I think it would be a really unique rifle for cowboy action shooting. Well, some day has come and I still don't have the time for this project so perhaps I can move it on to someone who does. As they say, &quot; Life is what happens to you while you're making other plans&quot;. Rifle is in pretty good shape with reasonable bluing and good bore with some rust up towards the muzzle on the outside of the barrel. I have fired this barreled action with a primed shell so I know it works, just needs a stock and a butt plate and some time to be a functional rifle. I am asking $900.00 and can Email photos to anyone who may be interested. You can Email me at <!-- e --><a href=\"mailto:haderondahcompany@yahoo.com\">haderondahcompany@yahoo.com</a><!-- e --> .

Not sure what cartridge it takes as it is a .50 rimfire. A U.S. 50/70 cartridge fits though from which I have read means it not one of the Swedish Rolling blocks. It could be a Papal States M1868 Papal States Remington (Pontificio).<br /><br />It is lacking the stampings, which is not unheard of in these licensed European contracts with Remington. It is only 47 inches long so I believe that it is an Artillery Musketoon, which is a short rifle. It is in very good condition for a rifle that is 140 years old. The bore is very clean with strong rifling and it shows only a Very light spotty pitting that could possibly be cleaned. The wood is nice with no major scars. The end cap is brass, as is the butt plate. Metal seems to be turning into a plum color patina. <br /><br />Just a four digit serial # 6625 and the number78 on the tang under the butt stock, also 78 and 8 marked on the bottom of the barrel and also on the forearm.</em>If it was Belgian made wouldn't it have Liege markings? The<br />pin retaining plate looks like Belgian guns I have seen. Attaching some pics.<br /><br />[OK. Pics did not attach] ???<br /><br />Any help appreciated.",

They are usually stamped on the top of the barrel with various Arabic markings, but not always: those diverted to France during the Franco-Prussian War, 1870, are not. Also, at one time some importers reamed out the chambers of some 11mm Spanish rifles so they could shoot 11mm Mannlicher ammo. Some were stamped &quot;11 MANN&quot; and some were not. At the very least take a caliper and try an get an accurate measurement of the chamber where the back end of the cartridge would be.<br />Your description of the rear of the barrel would indicate an Argentine contract that was originally chambered for the 11mm Spanish. If a 11mm Spanish case is loose in the chamber I would guess it had an 11mm Mannilcher reamer put into it.",

This barrel is round with two, almost non-existent flats on either side...just visible about the woodline, and extending only about 2 1/2 inches. I'll check out the web site you mentioned.",

        "content": "The Hepburn and patent date on my rifle is very shallow and would certainly disappear if the receiver were refinished. One explanation for yours would be a refinish. For kicks, can you measure the receiver thickness along the bottom center (where the stamp would have been) to the thousandth of an inch (or hundredth of a mm). I'll do the same and we can see how they compare. <br /><br />If you are concerned about the barrel belonging to the receiver, the barrel should be serialized to the receiver, as well as both pieces of wood and the butt plate. The number on the inside upper tang on my rifle does not match any of these other numbers, though <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_question.gif\" alt=\":?:\" title=\"Question\" /> <br /><br />I have thrown in a couple pics of my receiver and barrel markings.

That variation seems reasonable. <br /><br />Upper tang inside appears to be the same size and location<br /><br />Lower tang inside - mine doesn't have any mark.<br /><br />This part is interesting - you have two distinct numbers on your lower tang. It leads me to believe perhaps the 7744 is an assembly number. Since my upper tang number and serial number are different (7389 and 6772 respectively) I had previously assumed the receiver was a replacement, since all other parts have 6772 on them. <br /><br />I'm sure there are several others on this forum that know about this.

        "content": "Hopefully someone from Remington development and sales reads these ever once in a while.<br /><br />Many, myself included, were disappointed in Remingtons half-hearted attempt to bring back the roller. Instead of a traditional sporter, we got high gloss wood instead of satin, a round barrel, and well several major gunwriters voiced their disappoint in publications so no need to go into detail.<br /><br />This auction startled me: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.asp?Item=126035343\">http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewIt ... =126035343</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Apparently this is a custom shop Creedmoor and not a do-over by whomever. The seller has not replied to my queries as yet. What really caught my eye was the finish of metal and wood. And I appreciate the look of the rebated receiver and the offering of a SST.<br /><br />A quick look on the Remington Custom site describes options in small print which include SST, long range sights, CCH, metal forearm tip, etc. But it does not say anything about a 1/2 octagon barrel as depicted in the one-day auction of this rifle.<br /><br />It is apparent that Remington could build a sporter in the classical sense if they would just do it. Just take this action, reasonably good wood with a satin finish, straight grip of course, add the Rough and Ready rear sight, and put it in the original sporter configuration with a tapered <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">octagon barrel</span> and with the rebated receiver. Custom features as desired.<br /><br />I think they could compete very well with the current crop of imports and custom makers if they would just do it! And if they would provide options for traditional Buffalo calibers like 44-77 and 50-70, I'd jump on it. Heck its all I can do to keep from hitting buy on this 45-70 except that I have all the 45-70's I want. <br /><br />Please Remington!",

I wouldn't have given even $1,000 for what they had at the convention, and it should have been the cream of the crop.<br /> Nothing wrong with the gun at auction, or the caliber, as most folks will buy a .45-70 faster than anything else, but like you I've got too many in .45-70 now. That's why the original #1 action I'm restoring now will not be a .45-70, but instead a .40-65 cal.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v691/marlinguy/rlr3.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />",

It appears to have never been barreled or fitted with a stock. The movement of the action is very clean and precise. The entire piece seems to have been layed in a drawer and forgotten about.

The 722 stock is one of the nicest pieces of wood I have ever seen on a factory rifle. The butt stock is marble on both sides and straight grain thru the forearm. I am getting up in years and haven't any use for the stock and thought maybe someone would appreciate a good stick of wood for their 722. I can send you a photo as I don't know how to stick a picture to this message (yet). my email address is:<br /> <!-- e --><a href=\"mailto:kostan2@localnet.com\">kostan2@localnet.com</a><!-- e --> Make me a honest reasonable offer and the stick of wood is yours.<br />I also have some Hawiian Koa blanks and one semi-inlet for an older Ruger 77. This wood is on par with French Walnut and expensive if any one is interested. It is known as the wood of Kings. I love XP 100's and would entertain a trade with the Koa.<br /><br /> Kostan",

The problem that I have is that the mounting screw hole in the sight base is too small to accept the screw from the blank that was in the receiver. My question is: what size of screw was standard for the number 7? I am guessing that the screw in mine is an 8 by 40. The hole in the sight base appears to be for a number 6 screw. As I see it I have only one choice and that is to enlarge the hole in the base. Any one have a better suggestion?<br />Thanks,<br />Rider",

I checked with the smith last week and he had an accident and broke his back so I don't have any idea when I will have the rifle back.

        "content": "Pursuant to one of the Society Researchers:<br /><br />&quot;<strong>The first catalog I have that shows the No. 32 is the undated pocket catalog of about 1932 or 3, pre DuPont. It shows the double trigger No. 32A with 30-inch plain barrels as standard and 28- or 32-inch barrels to order. The double triggered No. 32 TC &quot;Target&quot; grade had 28-, 30- or 32-inch vent rib barrels. The third offering was the No. 32S &quot;Trap Special&quot; grade with 28-, 30-, or 32-inch solid rib barrels. This catalogue states &quot;Eventually we will have a single trigger for these guns but for the time being double triggers will be supplied. Later the single trigger can be fitted at a moderate extra charge.&quot; <br /><br />According to the 1938 Dealer's Price List the No. 32A &quot;Standard&quot; Grade had a wholesale price of $100.80 and a retail price of $126. A raised solid rib was $6/$8. Extra barrels were $52.50/$60. The choice of barrel lengths was 26-, 28-, or 30-inch with choice of boring -- full, modified, improved cylinder or cylinder. Higher grades were the No. 32D &quot;Tournament&quot; grade for $232.50/$276.50; No. 32E &quot;Expert&quot; grade for $276.25/$326.50; and the No. 32F &quot;Premier&quot; grade for $350.60/$411.50. Grip style and stock dimensions to order on the higher grades, $13.10/$15.00 extra on the No. 32A. <br /><br />The Trap gun was the No. 32TC &quot;Target&quot; grade for $123.35/$154.90 with 30- or 32-inch vent rib barrels. An extra set of vent rib barrels for the No. 32TC was $67.80/$80.40. <br /><br />The No. 32 &quot;Skeet&quot; grade came with 26- or 28-inch barrels with &quot;Remington Special Skeet boring.&quot; With a plain barrel $103.40/$129; with solid rib barrels $109.40/$137; and with vent rib barrels $118.70/$149.40.<br /><br />All the No. 32s were offered in 12-gauge only. The only gun that regularly came with a pad was the No. 32TC, which is shown with a Hawkins with the heart-shaped holes. A recoil pad was $4.65/$5.50 extra on any Remington gun. <br /><br />The No. 32 offerings in 1939 were the same, and by January 2, 1942, the offerings were still the same but prices were up sharply. In the 1947 catalog the No. 32s are pictured but overstamped &quot;Not Available in 1947</strong>.&quot;<br /><br />Question - If Model 32 manufacture was stopped in 1946 (per Remington catalogs) and their website states approximately 6100 guns were manufactured then the math says approximately 450 guns were produced each year. That means Remington continued producing for 6 additional years or thru 1952 to turn out enough guns to get to serial number 8888. <br /><br />The serial numbers you quote - are they Remington numbers? Were these guns made from spare parts post 1946 (Custom Shop Guns) or are they Del Grego upgrades? I am just starting my collection of Model 32s so I would appreciate any information you can provide. My collection is comprised of 11 guns; 2 Model 32Fs, 1 Model 32D, 1 Model 32E and 7 Model 32s/skeet/trap/double trigger/etc.<br /><br />Also I have no catalog reference of a Model 32TF. Is that a Model 32F with a 32&quot; barrel and a Hawkins recoil pad or is it an identified model?",

        "content": "I can't recall where i saw it printed, magazine article or maybe even a print of a 1945-47 catalog marked as discontinued item, i will try to locate in accumulated printed items over the years of collecting since the 1970's but if my memory serves me right, model 31 pumps, model 32 superposed, where advertised as available in a 1940's publication &quot;TF&quot; grade, and at that time frame &quot;T&quot; stood for target or trap depending who you speaking to, early more frequent 1930's printed material &quot;TC&quot; items refer to &quot;T&quot; for Target, with the &quot;C&quot; refers to C grade better grain/nicer wood set installed on the gun. Like the very brief &quot;32S&quot; trap gun and printed as such, uneducated persons would think the &quot;S&quot; would refer to a skeet gun, but it's &quot;S&quot; meaning was &quot;Special Trap&quot; as you have so noted. SN's i have narrowed down to this educated assumption. Before the fed's got gun purchasing regulations instituted with serial numbers documented to be tracked and traced upon purchase or selling items, specifically handguns being the main concern here, owners of long guns had the ability to customize by adding and or subtracting numbers with upgrading existing receivers already on the market in circulation with no concerns from the feds prior these regulations being instituted in the 1960's, i maybe wrong but, that's my educated guess, due to the handgun purchasing explosion of that era. Would enjoy seeing pics of your hi grade 32's, never seen a 32-D !!!! thanks !!!!",

I live not to far from Ilion enjoy the history.I have a Remington Keene barreled action 20&quot; barrel in caliber 45-70 for sale. I've had this for several years and was always going to make a project of it some day to restock it and make a fun shooter out of it. I think it would be a really unique rifle for cowboy action shooting. Well, some day has come and I still don't have the time for this project so perhaps I can move it on to someone who does. As they say, &quot; Life is what happens to you while you're making other plans&quot;. Rifle is in pretty good shape with reasonable bluing and good bore with some rust up towards the muzzle on the outside of the barrel. I have fired this barreled action with a primed shell so I know it works, just needs a stock and a butt plate and some time to be a functional rifle. I am asking $900.00 and can Email photos to anyone who may be interested. You can Email me at <!-- e --><a href=\"mailto:haderondahcompany@yahoo.com\">haderondahcompany@yahoo.com</a><!-- e --> .

The 44 2 7/16 rb was recently auctioned off as a buffalo rifle. The vernier rear and windguage front sights were taken off by a collector in California several years ago. The butt stock was also modified. This is not to say they did not make any. I have only handled some few over 1000 sporters and target rifles so there are still lots out there to look at.",

        "content": "Thanks for the further info. Where I am going with this is having a &quot;donator&quot; action rebarreled with a 34&quot; tapered octagon barrel, &quot;rough &amp; ready&quot; rear sight and either a beach or tube &amp; post front sight. Kinda a cross between a sporter &amp; a target rifle. want to stay with a Remington cartridge that was around during the 1870's. Since I already have a rebarreled RB in 44-77 &amp; want to stay with a Remington caliber the 44-90 will be it.<br />From what I can gather, Remington was like Sharps during this era in that they would build pretty much what you wanted if you wanted to pay for it. Since most all of the 44 caliber &amp; up (Remington did not recommend anything smaller than the 44-77 for Buffalo) Sharps cartridges were a little long to be easily chambered quickly ( got to get around the hammer nose) I'm kinda telling myself that an old hunter that wanted a little more poop than the 44-77 &amp; did not want to go to .50 Govt. (guvmint?) the 44-90 would have been the logical choice. At least that is my story (fantasy?) &amp; I'm sticken to it (at least for now).",

My thinking is that is why Remington used bottleneck cases. The engineering left only an absolute length that a case could be so the alternative was to make the case wider for greater case capacity.

        "content": "Dear Rick<br />Good find there! I have an exact copy of this carbine listed in my new Military Rolling Block book which will be out in December from Mowbray Publishing Co. (Man at Arms). The variation I have in the identical caliber has a slightly longer chamber almost as a.52-70 rimfire and has the Cambodian/Siamese Chakra over the receiver ring. It also has Sanskrit markings beneath the stock. and appears to have been issued to Cambodia when it became a French Protectorate sometime around 1884. Your carbine may be one of the several thousand of unamed (as of now) caliber carbines sold to France durng the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. If you note, the barrel on yours has rounded sides to the chamber which is reminiscent of either a Spencer or Whitney barrel. Try to measure your chamber and see if it is longer the standard .56-50 Spencer ctge. When my book gets out, read into that section of Cambodia thorouoghly, and it might give a better insight perhaps. Also look for any unusual markings that may be worn on yours, as well as under the forearm. By the way does your rear sight have the Springfield 1861 / 63 musket style &quot;spanner&quot; screw in lieu of the standard flat head groove type? I will be in touch..<br /><br />Regards,<br />George Layman",

        "content": "It has been reported that the longer lower tang separates the #1 Sporter from military and all other types. Yet De Haas says that both #1 and 1 1/2 actions had the longer lower early. What is early? Someone said the 1 1/2 appeared in 1888 but Schiers book says it appeared in Remington catalogs in the mid 1870's. Who's right?<br /><br />Based on the wood profile, I've located a #1 sporter but the guy reports the action as 1.24, the lower tang is longer. I wonder if he measured the upper hex flats instead of the action walls though as this is a little large for the 1/2 and too small for the No. 1. Caliber is 38-55. Barrel markings are E. Remington &amp; Sons and has patents on left side of receiver.",

        "content": "Thought you had a #1 Sporter Yellowhouse? If you measure the receiver you'll find it probably is very close to 1.24&quot; width. Mine measures 1.245&quot; wide.<br /> As for #1 1/2's having long lower tangs, DeHaas was smokin something that day! The 1 1/2 Roller has equal length tangs that are both the same as the top tang of a #1 Sporter.-Vall<br /><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v691/marlinguy/tangs.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br /><br /><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v691/marlinguy/rem2.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />",
