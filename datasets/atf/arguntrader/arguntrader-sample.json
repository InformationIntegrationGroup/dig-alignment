        "content": "Finally got a little bench time this past weekend to get it all together. This is about as correct as a build as I can get for a Navy Colt MK18 Mod 0 (other than a M16 A2 lower of course, dont currently have an extra 20k to toss out on that yet..lol) I have been gathering parts for this upper for about a year now. I located a correct profile Colt barrel, actaully bought two. They were service rifle barrels which were low round count but pretty rough finish wise and were the incorrect length. So I had to get them cut,crowned,threaded, gas port opened to spec, bead blasted and re-parked. Thats when I reached out to our fellow member UncleH. I knew that he had been reworking and building precision rifles for a while and had the right equiptment. I gave him a call and he agreed to take the project on. UncleH is one of those guys that if he does it, its gonna be done right. I wish I had a before pic of these barrels, but I didnt take one. Here are a couple pics of them after he got done with them. The crowns on them are flawless, threads are perfectly centered and the re finish made them look new. He also opened the gas port to .074 to ensure reliability. He does amazing work. <br /><br />Here is the finished product with parts list:<br />Colt Upper Receiver <br />Colt CH<br />Colt Full Auto Profile BCG<br />Colt 10.3 Barrel with FSB<br />Colt Gas Tube<br />Colt Side Sling Swivel<br />Knights Armament RAS with Panel Kit and Vertical Grip<br />Knights Armament NT4 Suppressor Ready FH<br />LMT Rear BUIS <br />Aimpoint Comp M2 (NV Compatible) in a Wilcox Mount <br />Colt M4 Lower (SBR Registered) <br />LMT SOPMOD Gen 1 Stock",

        "content": "Tell me if I'm upset over nothing...<br /><br />Ok I need to gripe for a minute. I made a deal today where I sold a pistol to 22ish yo member of the military. Made the deal off Facebook. We met at the agreed location. He was on time, has had good communication, and has been very respectful (yes sir, no sir type stuff). He looks the pistol over, says he will take it, hands me the cash, and I proceed to fill out two copies of the bill of sale while he looks the pistol over. While I'm still doing paperwork, he asked me what I carried. I told him. Next thing I know there is a Megastar .45 with the mag out sitting next to me on the tailgate of my truck. He did not clear the chamber so I assume it was loaded. He tells me about the gun and the deal he got, put it back in his CC holster, and we finish the deal.<br /><br />The thing is, the more I think about it, the more upset I get that he unholstered his CC pistol behind my back and without telling me. I realize he is a younger guy and just wanted to show off his pistol. However I just thought that it was not appropriate the way he went about it. Am I upset for no reason? Should I just forget about it? What are you guys thoughts?",

In a sense I suppose its good it happened the way it did. It could of been worse depending on how you would of reacted if you had saw him reaching for his weapon. I personaly watch everyone I deal with while doing trades and honestly, if Halfway thru the deal I noticed the other guy reaching for what could be a gun I would probably be drawing mine as well. Ya, he just didnt know better or think about it, but thats how bad things happen.",

        "content": "Well, I first got onto this website looking to sell my Savage 30-06 rifle. I never would have imagined they had a section for prayer request. Instead of selling my rifle I'm going to depend on God and ask for your prayers. <br /><br />My wife and I just had a new baby girl on January 15. My baby is healthy and it is an amazing feeling being a father. We were released from the hospital and made it home safely. My wife then went to work to talk about maternity leave. My daughter was a month early so it was kinda unexpected to this point. <br /><br />My wife spoke with her work and they are not paying anything for her leave. Yes, they are paying $0.00 for her six weeks off in recovery. I have no clue how we are going to afford rent, utilities or supporting this new baby without God's help. Just join in prayer with me. <br /><br />That being said, If anyone lives around NWA I am willing to work. Anything you have extra. I am a cop and taking leave with my wife. But we have decided I need work to make up for her recovery. I also have a Savage Axis 30-06 for sale. CHEAP. <br /><br />Thank you- Justin",

<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /> <br /><br /><br />A Father’s Prayer<br /><br />High as the heavens, deep as the oceans,<br />Filled with hope and despair,<br />As broad as the east is from the west<br />Describes a fathers prayer.<br /><br />A prayer of conviction, a prayer for strength,<br />A prayer for faith foursquare,<br />A seeking of counsel, with his God and King,<br />This is a fathers prayer.<br /><br />A plea for guidance, in leading his clan,<br />Made in all humility,<br />From the head of the household, to his Lord and Master,<br />With bowed head, and on bended knee,<br /><br />For he is entrusted, by the creator Himself,<br />With the obligation to oversee,<br />That the needs of his family are met and fulfilled,<br />Both physical, and spiritually.<br /><br />A prayer for forgiveness, when he is in err,<br />When to weakness he succumbs,<br />A prayer for wisdom, to make the right choice,<br />When the time for decisions does come.<br /><br />A prayer of dire urgency, <br />A daddy’s desperate plea,<br /> Take my children’s suffering,<br />And give it unto me.<br /><br />Give my children peace and rest,<br />Give to me their pain,<br />Give to me their sickness,<br />I will bear it and not complain.<br /><br />To keep his family safe and sound,<br />To lead past pitfalls and snares,<br />To protect his loved ones from danger and evil,<br />All of this, is a father’s prayer.<br /><br /><br /><br />Family Man<br /><br />I have worn a lot of hats,<br />A Jack of many trades,<br />So many titles I have used,<br />Throughout my Earthly days.<br /><br /> But there is one I’ve like the most,<br />The best I ever had,<br />The one that makes me swell with pride,<br />Is the one where I’m called Dad.<br /><br />A family man is what I am, <br />Of that I’m proud to say,<br />And I wouldn’t have it,<br />Not any other way.<br /><br />I wouldn’t trade what I have now,<br />For all wealth in this land,<br />I am the richest man alive,<br />I am a family man.<br /><br />It’s not your standard nine to five,<br />But the benefits are great,<br />The job starts early morning,<br />And doesn’t end till late.<br /><br />And even when the day is through,<br />And into bed I crawl,<br />I’m really still on duty,<br />Because I’m on constant call.<br /><br />Always at the ready,<br />To comfort or defend,<br />To chase away the boogie man,<br />And restore the peace again.<br /><br />And with the rising of the sun,<br />I’m on the job again,<br />I have to be the type of man,<br />On whom my family can depend.<br /><br />In the image of the Father,<br />I strive to make a stand,<br />I am Daddy, all the way,<br />I am a family man.<br /><br /><br />Teddy Bear Prayers<br /><br />Late at night when children sleep,<br />While their dreams take them away,<br />The Teddy Bears come to the side of the bed,<br />And bow their heads to pray.<br /><br />In whispered Teddy Bear voices,<br />They petition our Father above,<br />To send peaceful dreams filled with wonderful things,<br />To this special child that they love.<br /><br />They pray for angels descending,<br />To stand watch ore the child through the night,<br />With a double edged sword, reinforced by the Lord,<br /> To give evil a fatal fight.<br /><br />Last but not least the small plushy beast,<br />Includes a request of it’s own,<br />To be cared for and cuddled, loved and snuggled,<br />Long after the children have grown.<br /><br />Once Amen is said, they climb into bed,<br />And nuzzle the child in their care,<br />And God Himself smiles, <br />Upon the bear and the child,<br />When He hears the Teddy Bear Prayers.<br /><br /><br /><br />Father Please<br /><br />I stand on the brink of a miracle,<br />An event that will change my life,<br />The greatest gift of love, that our Lord above,<br />Can bestow on a husband and wife.<br /><br />I stand on the brink of creation,<br />A father I soon will be,<br />A position of great importance,<br />And responsibility.<br /><br />Charged with the physical well-being,<br />And spiritual needs of my family,<br />I ask for wisdom and guidance,<br />I ask for Thy help, Father please.<br /><br />I ask that my child be healthy and whole,<br />Free from sickness and disease,<br />I ask that both mother and child,<br />Live long fruitful lives, Father please.<br /><br />I ask for patience when my day is long,<br />And my mind is a raging sea,<br />I ask to be tender, loving and mild,<br />When I handle my child, Father please.<br /><br />I ask for courage and power,<br />To defeat my enemies,<br />To protect my family in times of danger,<br />I ask for Thy strength, Father please.<br /><br />I ask for the Holy Spirit,<br />To help teach my child about Thee,<br />As I teach her Thy way, and how she should pray,<br />I ask for Thy love Father please.<br /><br />I thank Thee dear Lord for Thy blessings,<br />For Thy grace and tender mercies,<br />I ask for the shelter of Thy mighty hand,<br />I ask, keep us safe, Father please.<br /><br />I ask Dear Lord that You help me be,<br />A fraction as good a Father as Thee.<br />I humbly ask on bended knee,<br />In Christ Holy name I ask, Father please.<br /><br /><br /><br />Little Prayers<br /><br />When a little one kneels beside his bed,<br />Before he goes to sleep,<br />Folds his hands, and bows his head,<br />And prays the Lord his soul to keep.<br /><br />Or when he sits before a meal,<br />And bows his little head,<br />And thanks the Lord for His blessings,<br />And for his daily bread,<br /><br />Or when a little one sits in Sunday school,<br />And bows his head to pray,<br />And ask the Lord to teach him,<br />To walk the Christian way.<br /><br />The angels sing in chorus,<br />And the bells of Heaven ring,<br />For little prayers are precious,<br />To God our Father and King.<br /><br />So young, so small and innocent,<br />So precious and pure of heart,<br />Our Father loves those little prayers,<br />In each and every part.<br /><br />Children do not question who He is,<br />Or how He came to be,<br />Through the eyes of innocence,<br />They see more clear than we.<br /><br />So raise your little ones on God's Holy word,<br />Each and every day,<br />Take your children to Sunday school,<br />And teach them how to pray.<br /><br /><br />Young Ones<br /><br />Rapture divine,<br />Grace so sweet,<br />When a young one lays their soul,<br />At the Saviors feet.<br /><br />Sweet surrender,<br />To salvation's plan,<br />Guided to grace,<br />By the Masters hand.<br /><br />Joy unspeakable,<br />Glory untold,<br />When a young one enters,<br />The shepherd's fold.<br /><br />Spirit of God,<br />Fill up my soul,<br />Until my heart,<br />Shall overflow.<br /><br />I revel dear Lord,<br />In thy Glory and Might,<br />I praise thy name,<br />And my soul takes flight.<br /><br />Blessed be the children,<br />Who knock at your door,<br />Keep them safe in thy bosom,<br />Forever more.<br /><br />New children are born,<br />Each and every day,<br />Give us wisdom Lord ,<br />To show them the way.<br /><br />Help us teach them Lord,<br />What you would have them know,<br />Help us guide them Lord,<br />Where you would have them go.<br /><br />Help us Oh Lord,<br />With our responsibility,<br />In guiding our young ones,<br />Closer to thee.<br /><br /><br />Hope some dad somewhere finds a blessing in one of these.<br />Some day Jesus shall come again, if I don't see you sooner, I'll sure see you then.<br />Calvin Hart",

The muzzle diameter is about .630 in the area where the sight would fit. The barrel ring on the sight is .610. The material thickness is .065. It is made from 6061 Aluminum. I'm thinking about getting the sight and reaming it to fit. There really are not many feasible options for the configuration I want. So, with the NDS-44, I'm looking at either altering the sight to make it fit the barrel or altering the barrel to make it fit the sight. I prefer to alter the sight but I am wondering if removing .010 would cause me any problems.<br /><br />Here's a pic to show the configuration of the sight in question if that helps (this is actually a different model for the bull barrel, but it shows what I'm talking about).<br /><br />I need to make the inside of the round part bigger. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /><br /><br /><div class=\"inline-attachment\"> <dl class=\"file\"> <dt class=\"attach-image\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=28056\" alt=\"NDS-23e.jpg\" onclick=\"viewableArea(this);\" /></dt> <dd>NDS-23e.jpg (25.1 KiB) Viewed 46 times</dd> </dl> </div>",

Your friend could chuck it in the lathe, find centers, and remove material in no time. I would hit it with Birtchwood Casey Perma Blue or Super Blue before installing the front sight base, to prevent any rusting. <br /><br />Make sure he goes back far enough to allow a few thousands gap between the shoulder of the muzzle threads and the face of the front sight base. The suppressor should rest against shoulder cut by the factory, not the front sight base. The factory shoulders will be perfectly square to the muzzle, preventing baffle or end cap strikes. <br /><br />Sent from my XT1058 using Tapatalk",

        "content": "Per RWB this is what you do for UPS. &quot;UPS Hazmat team told me to do just what you said in a rectangle box write ORM-D as many times as you see fit to and write Cartidges, Small arms in a couple places you just could not ship from one of there terminals. Nothing over 66lbs.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Found this and I thought some people mightfind it useful.<br />The D.O.T. has a classification called Title 49 CFR that spells out the details. We have summarized those details for you specific to shipping ammunition. FedEx has the same requirements, but also wants you to include a “Shippers Declaration for Dangerous Goods” form which is on their site if you do a search for “Dangerous Goods Forms”. The USPS follows the D.O.T. requirements.<br /><br />Title 49 CFR states in Chapter 1, section 173.63 the packaging exceptions to full regulation. Under that section, (b) Cartridges, small arms, may be reclassed, and offered for transportation, and transported as ORM–D material when packaged in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section; such transportation is excepted from the requirements of subparts E (Labeling) of part 172 of this subchapter. Cartridges, small arms, and cartridges power devices that may be shipped as ORM–D material is limited to:<br /><br />Under this “limited to” section, there is item (i) Ammunition for rifle, pistol or shotgun; and (iv) Ammunition not exceeding 12.7 mm (50 caliber or 0.5 inch) for rifle or pistol, cartridges or 8 gauge for shot shells.<br /><br />This is the critical part to shipping ammunition. If it is 50 caliber or less, or 8 gauge or less, UPS will take the shipment in a sturdy box marked with a ORM-D, Cartridges, Small Arms label on the outside of the box. UPS does recommend using this label as opposed to a regular ORM-D label from our research and inquiries to UPS themselves. Part 172, subchapter E states the label should be affixed near the shipping address location on the package. By placing it here, the carrier will see it as they direct the package to the correct location during shipment.<br /><br />Now, under section 173.115, part (v) it states that cartridges, and 22 caliber rim-fire cartridges may be packaged loose in strong outside packaging. The label marking is the same as above.<br /><br />There have been a lot of questions about Hazardous Material training for shipping ORM-D materials. This is a true fact. UPS or any other carrier does not require training. It is required by the D.O.T. and is listed under section 172.74 were the training can be performed by yourself and all you need to have is a documented record of the following:<br /><br />* Hazmat employee name<br />* Training date<br />* Copy of the training materials<br />* Name and address of person providing training (This can be yourself)<br />* A certificate showing the employee is trained. (This can be made in house) <br /><br />A description of the training is found at hazmat.dot.gov on the Internet without the www and click on rules and regulations. The key part of the in house training is you don’t have to pay someone to train you. Just read this section and put together the emergency contacts, and procedures in case there is a issue. Easy stuff. With that, anyone can ship ammunition with ease, and the correct way.<br /><br />Key resources for this ammunition shipping guideline included UPS through their hazardous materials department at 800-554-9964, FedEx 800.463.3339 through Dangerous Goods, USPS local locations and the Department of Transportation Classification division at 800-467-4922 and the Office of Hazardous Materials Safety on line at <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat\">http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat</a><!-- m --> were all the documentation is listed. Knowing how to ship ammunition or ammo the correct way is important. Please pass this information on.<br /> <br /><br />Here is the official code:<br /><br />How to ship ammunition…<br /><br />Code of Federal Regulations, Title 49, Part 173 173.63<br /><br />Packaging exceptions (b) Cartridges, small arms, and cartridges power devices.<br /><br />(1) Cartridges, small arms and cartridges power devices (which are used to project fastening devices) which have been classed as a Division 1.4S explosive may be reclassed, offered for transportation, and transported as ORM-D material when packaged in accordance with paragraph (b)<br /><br />(2) of this section; such transportation is excepted from the requirements of subparts E (Labeling) and F (Placarding) of part 172 of this subchapter.<br /><br />Cartridges, small arms, and cartridges power devices that may be shipped as ORM-D material is limited to:<br /><br />(i) Ammunition for rifle, pistol, or shotgun;<br /><br />(ii) Ammunition with inert projectiles or blank ammunition;<br /><br />(iii) Ammunition having no tear gas, incendiary, or detonating explosive projectiles;<br /><br />(iv) Ammunition not exceeding 12.7 mm (50 caliber or 0.5 inch) for rifle or pistol, cartridges or 8 gauge for shotshells; and<br /><br />(v) Cartridges power devices which are use to project fastening devices. (<br /><br />2) Packaging for cartridges, small arms, and cartridges power devices as ORM-D material must be as follows:<br /><br />(i) Ammunition must be packed in inside boxes, or in partitions which fit snugly in the outside packaging, or in metal clips;<br /><br />(ii) Primers must be protected from accidental initiation;<br /><br />(iii) Inside boxes, partitions or metal clips must be packed in securely-closed strong outside packagings;<br /><br />(iv) Maximum gross weight is limited to 30 Kg (66 pounds) per package; and<br /><br />(v) Cartridges, power devices which are used to project fastening devices and 22 caliber rim-fire cartridges may be packaged loose in strong outside packagings.<br /><br />Part 172 (Marking) 172.316 Packagings containing material classed as ORM-D<br /><br />(a) Each non-bulk packaging containing a material classed as ORM-D must be marked on at least one side or end with the ORM-D designation immediately following or below the proper shipping name of the material (Cartridges, Small Arms). The ORM designation must be placed within a rectangle that is approximately 6.3 mm (0.25 inches) larger on each side that the designation.<br /><br />(b) The marking ORM-D is the certification by the person offering the packaging for transportation that the material is properly described, classed, packaged, marked and labeled (when appropriate) and in proper condition for transportation according to the applicable regulations of this subchapter.<br /><br />So, basically you need to label the box on the end as ORM-D inside a square box you have drawn, then print Cartridges, 'Small Arms'; UPS illustration using 'Consumer Commodity'; (change to 'Cartridges, Small Arms') UPS hazardous/restricted items section @ 1-800-554-9964",

        "content": "<a href=\"http://www.tacticaloperations.com/SWATbarrel/\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.tacticaloperations.com/SWATbarrel/</a><br /><br />BARREL LENGTH AND THE PRECISION RIFLE<br />Why shorter barrels may often be better<br />by <br />Eugene Nielsen<br /><br />There’s a growing trend to shorter barrels on tactical precision rifles. In years past, a 24- to 26-inch barrel was practically a given. Accepted wisdom was that it was necessary to sacrifice a little maneuverability to gain a more complete powder burn and significantly reduced flash signature. Today, it’s not uncommon to rifles with significantly shorter barrels.<br /><br /> Attitudes are are changing. The desire for more maneuverable rifles for the urban setting has led a growing number of manufacturer's to come out with shorter-barreled precision rifles. This brings up an obvious question -- how short is too short? What sacrifices, if any, are made by going to a shorter barrel?<br /><br /> To answer these questions, we must first start by taking a look at the subject of internal ballistics. Internal ballistics is a very complex subject. There are many factors which affect the internal performance of a given cartridge and bullet. Factors affecting internal performance include the powder chamber capacity; load density; amount and burning characteristics of the propellant powder; temperature of the propellant prior to ignition; uniformity and speed of ignition; diameter, weight and bearing length of the bullet; and the length of the barrel and its interior dimensions.<br /><br /> Longer barrels give the powder more time to work on propelling the bullet. For this reason longer barrels generally provide higher velocities, everything else being equal. However, the gas pressure behind the bullet diminishes as the bullet moves down the bore. Given a long enough barrel, there will eventually be a point in which the bore friction and air pressure in front of the bullet will equal the gas pressure behind it. At this point, the velocity of the bullet will start to decrease.<br /> <br /> <br />Shorter barrels are capable of surprising long-range accuracy. San Fernando (California) PD Special Response Team long rifle marksman Chris Colelli, shown here, fired a three-shot group at 700 yards that measured just under two inches center-to-center. Colleli also fired a sub-1/4- inch group at 200 yards. The target is now framed and hanging in his lieutenant's office.<br /><br /> There isn't any clear-cut answer as to how much velocity will be lost per inch of barrel length reduction. The amount of loss is closely tied to the expansion ratio. As previously noted, the type and amount of powder, as well as the weight and bearing length of the bullet, also play a major part. Rifles with high expansion ratios (smaller calibers) tend to lose less velocity than rifles with low expansion ratios (larger calibers). <br /><br /> Tactical Operations about in the April 2000 issue of S.W.A.T., typifies the trend to rifles with shorter barrels. Tac Ops considers a barrel of length of 18 to 20 inches to be optimal for the urban environment, with 18 inches the preferred length.<br /><br /> During the development of the Tango 51, Tac Ops took a standard 26-inch barrel and cut it down to 18 inches in one-inch increments. Between 10 to 20 rounds were fired at each increment. They found that a 20-inch barrel provides for a complete propellant burn and no velocity loss when using Federal Match 168-grain BTHP, a cartridge that has become something of a law enforcement standard. Going to an 18-inch barrel only resulted in a loss of 32 feet per second (fps).<br /><br /> Shorter barreled rifles are more versatile, being equally suitable for both urban and rural operations. According to Tac Ops, there isn't any need to go to the 26-inch barrel unless you want to go to a heavier bullet or push the round to higher velocity using more powder or use a slower burning powder. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) performed tests similar to those conducted by Tac Ops and came to similar conclusions. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lambrecht, SEB armorer and Special Weapons Team long rifle expert, recently chronographed the Federal Match 168-gr. BTHP rounds. Lambrecht said that the muzzle velocity was averaging around 2,660 to 2,670 feet per second (fps) from the 20-inch-barreled Tango 51 that Tac Ops delivered to him.<br /><br /> The accuracy of the Tango 51 isn't hampered by the shorter barrel. While at the range with the Tango 51 we were consistently getting sub-1/4 MOA accuracy at longer ranges? Well, the shorter barrel doesn't hamper longer range accuracy either.<br /><br /> As I mentioned in my article on the Tango 51, San Fernando (CA) PD Special Response Team long rifle marksman Chris Colelli once fired a 3-shot sub-1/4-inch group at the article appeared, Colelli fired a 3-shot group from the rifle at 700 yards that measured just under 2 inches center to center. The group, which was witnessed by several credible spotters, was shot off of a bipod with one small sandbag.<br /> <br />Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) Special Weapons Team long rifle experts Fred Keelin (left) with Tac Ops Alpha 66<br /><br /> Colelli is a superb marksman, one of the best that I've seen, but he would be the first to admit that an element of luck played a role in this feat. Groups like these certainly aren't typical of what could be realistically expected under actual operational conditions. Still, they show that the rifle is capable of phenomenal accuracy provided that the operator does his or her part.<br /><br /> Although the 20-inch barrel remains very popular with agencies purchasing the Tango 51, many agencies prefer an 18-inch barrel for its added maneuverability. With the 18-inch barrel, you're still shooting around 2,630 fps with Federal Match. The target certainly isn't going to know if he's being hit with a bullet that leaves the muzzle at 2,660 fps or 2,630 fps. The terminal ballistics are identical.<br /><br /> Going to an 18-inch barrel doesn't adversely effect the accuracy of the rifle. Tac Ops has achieved incredible accuracy with the shorter barrels. The 18-inch barreled Tango 51 rifles will still shoot sub-1/4 MOA. The performance is just as good with the 18-inch barrel as it is with the 20-inch barrel out to a distance of 600 yards. After initially going with the 20-inch barrel for their Tango 51s, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has decided to go with the 18-inch barrel and Tac Ops 30 suppressor on all new Tango 51s that they purchase. <br /><br /> Shorter barrels are actually often more accurate than their longer counterparts. A rifle barrel is a cantilevered beam and as such they sag. More sag results in more whip and vibration as the bullet travels down the bore. Barrel sag induces longitudinal stress that can cause stringing of shots. Using a shorter, heavier barrel minimizes reduces stress and accuracy-robbing barrel vibration. A shorter barrel is stiffer and vibrates at a less.<br /><br /> Barrel length and contour determines the relative &quot;stiffness&quot; of a barrel, i.e., how much a barrel will tend to vibrate. Shorter barrels generally have oscillations of smaller amplitude. than longer barrels. Thicker barrels generally have fewer vibration nodes than slimmer barrels. The ringing frequency of a thicker barrel is higher and the oscillations are of a smaller amplitude and of a shorter duration. This equates to less barrel motion at the muzzle. The use of a shorter barrel also allows the use of a heavier contour without making the rifle unwieldy.<br /><br /> The use of a heavier contour tends to provide less variation between a cold shot and any subsequent follow-up shots. Barrels expand as they heat up. As the barrel expands any stress on or in the barrel will cause stringing of the shots. Bore expansion results in an increase in group size. Heavier barrels tend to be more consistent because they take longer to heat up. <br /><br /> An 18- to 20-inch barrel may be fine for a caliber like the .308 Win., but what about calibers such as the .300 Winchester Magnum (7.62x66B)? Many agencies are opting for this cartridge as a result of its long range ballistics. The .308 Win. has a maximum effective range of about 800 yards. While this is certainly more than enough for most law enforcement scenarios (law enforcement snipers rarely have to engage targets at more than 100 yards), the .300 Win. Mag. does increase the maximum effective range by an additional this comes with the price of additional recoil. <br /><br /> Many agencies purchasing a .300 Win. Mag. will primarily be employing the rifle in an urban environment. The common reason for opting for the .300 Win. Mag. that it extends the capabilities of the rifle to longer ranges than the .308 Winchester is capable in those rare situations where longer range capability is necessary. This leads to an obvious question -- will going to a shorter barrel for added maneuverability in the urban environment adversely affect long range performance of a rifle in this caliber?<br /><br /> To find the answers, Tac Ops took a 26-inch barreled .300 Win. Mag. and chopped the barrel down in one-inch increments as they previously did with the .308 Winchester. Ten rounds of Federal Match 190-grain BTHP Gold Medal were fired from each increment. No velocity was lost from 26 inches to 22 inches. Velocity loss started to occur only after they went below 22 inches.<br /><br /> As a result of their tests, Tac Ops decided not to go below 22 inches on their .300 Win. Mag. tactical precision rifle, the Alpha 66. According to Mike Rescigno, President of Tac Ops, the 22-inch barrel is ideal for the tactical shooters that are going to use the 190-grain Federal Match ammo. There isn't any loss of performance by going to the 22-inch barrel and this round. The Alpha 66 still provides 1/4-MOA or better accuracy.<br /><br /> For heavier bullets or hotter loads with slower burning powders, Rescigno recommends a 24- to 26-inch barrel. The longer barrel length is necessary for complete powder combustion with these loads. Rescigno adds that he has a 24-inch barrel on his personal .300 Win. Mag. just in case he wants &quot;to shoot the heavier 220-grain bullets with a lot of powder.&quot; <br /> <br /> <br />TOP: After testing and evaluation, the SEB has decided to go with an 18-inch barrel on all new .308 Win. Tango 51s, and a 22-inch barrel on all .300 Win Mag. Tactical precision rifles. Fred Keeling (left) is shown with with a suppressed 18-inch-barreled Tango 51 .308 Win., and Guy Geisler (right) is shown with a 22-inch-barreled Alpha 66 .300 Win. Mag.<br /><br />BOTTOM: The optional barrel length is closely tied to the loads that will be employed. There is no loss of performance from the .300 Win. Mag. Federal Match 190-grain BTHP when fired from barrels as short as 22 inches. The above Alpha 66 has Tac Ops muzzle brake installed. <br /><br /> At this point, I can hear readers asking, &quot;What about muzzle blast and muzzle flash? Won't they be a problem with the shorter barrels?&quot; These are valid concerns. With both calibers, shorter barrels do increase the muzzle blast and muzzle flash somewhat. It's not as much as one might expect. From a practical standpoint, the differences between a 24- or 26-inch barrel and an 18- or 20-inch barrel are negligible, except when slow burning powders are used.<br /><br /> Any concerns over the muzzle blast and sound/flash signature can easily be eliminated by the use of a sound suppressor (silencer). With today's compact, low-maintenance suppressors, such as the Tac Ops 30, there's no reason that all tactical precision rifles shouldn't be so equipped. More and more law enforcement agencies are coming to this conclusion. <br /><br /> The use of a sound suppressor provides a number of advantages to both the shooter and spotter. The suppressor greatly reduces any ground disturbance and eliminates any muzzle flash/sound signature that can identify the position or disturb vision and hearing. There isn't any necessity for the shooter or spotter to wear hearing protection. Many shooters find that their accuracy improves when a suppressor is employed due to the resulting reduction in the muzzle blast and recoil. The reduction in recoil also permits quicker follow-up shots. <br /><br /> A sound suppressor can substantially reduce the recoil velocity and recoil energy of a rifle. Gas volume and gas pressure at the muzzle are major factors in the free recoil energy produced by a rifle. Shorter barrels generally result in increased gas volumes and higher gas pressures at the muzzle. All other factors being equal, increased gas volumes and higher gas pressures at the muzzle will increase the recoil velocity and free recoil energy.<br /><br /> Free recoil energy is proportional to the square of the recoil velocity of the rifle. Doubling the recoil velocity quadruples the free recoil energy. Sound suppressors reduce the free recoil energy by suppressing the effects of the expanding powder gasses. They also add weight, slowing the acceleration of the rifle.<br /><br /> In summary, the appropriate barrel length is closely tied to the caliber and the load or loads that will be employed. If a shorter barrel provides equivalent or better accuracy and little or no loss in velocity, why go to a longer barrel? Why sacrifice maneuverability and add excess weight? While old attitudes may die hard, chronographs and ballistics don't lie. Shorter barrels are often better. The proof is in the performance.<br /> <br /><br /> SOURCE<br />Tactical Operations, Inc. <br />433 North Camden Dr. 4th Fl. #239<br />Beverly Hills, Ca 90210<br />Phone 310 275-8797<br />Fax 323 933-3521",

        "content": "I agree with the article on alot of things, But he was all over board proving his point and left out a few things. He is right you really on lose velocity in a shorter barrel. But when talking about the .308 and using factory ammo, and wanting to shoot out to a 1000 yards, air temp and elevation will have a effect on it also, I have shot my Rem700 5R 24 barrel at Camp Robinson on the 1000 yard many times and a load that works for some of the guys using 26&quot; barrel would not keep my bullets supersonic all the time. If you are buying a .308 and never plan to shoot past 600 yards then it wont matter much, if you ever want to shoot 1000 yards you will have to use a 175g bullet and be running at max load using a 24&quot; or shorter barrel. I have found in some conditions two inch longer barrel does make a differnce when wanting to shoot long. So if money is no object and you plan on having several rifles then it dosnt matter, but if you want one to use for many things get at least a 24&quot; barrel.<br /><br />Well thats my two cents.<br />Uncle H",

Just walk up to the counter in sporting goods and ask the man or women if they have any ammo on the truck. They should be able to look at the sheet and see what's coming off the truck. Now remember that everyone and their mother is asking the same questions &quot; You Got Any Ammo&quot; so just play it cool and they will treat you right. If your an ass then they will treat you like a ass. Hope this helps...Good luck!!!",

When people ask me about the differences or say it is like Crossbreed, I tell them the truth. They will be happy with either. Both are great comfortable holsters and will serve well. There a few differences, like the kydex Tommy's uses for the shell is a little thicker than the one Crossbreed uses (or use to to the best of my knowledge) so it will last longer and not be prone to cracking. <br /><br />But I want to take a second to open your eyes to something. Crossbreed was a knockoff itself and not original. There were many making and using kydex/leather IWB holsters before they were ever made commercially. Crossbreed wasn't even the first to offer them commercially though, IIRC it was Tucker who first did that. So if you are going to try to call someone out try to have your facts straight, you should have said &quot;Just another Tucker knockoff&quot;. Then my answer would have been &quot;Yeah, but isn't your car just a Henry Ford knock off?&quot;<br /><br />Also, although I have nothing bad to say about Crossbreed I will say that Theis Holsters are priced lower and have less wait time.",

Three total, not 3 of each kind. This morning all they had was some Tula 223 and 7.62x39. I picked up a 100 box of 45 for $35 last week and 3 boxes of 223 today just for giggles. Saw on another post I think a WM in Little Rock had the 100 rd 45's for $40. Wally World is getting ammo in spurts, but they are getting some. Hang tight, check the local stores, and stay away from the gougers.",

A father and son of Indian descent say they got kicked out because of their skin color and they are Hindu. The range claims they have a right to refuse anyone since it is a private business. Is this a big story in Hot Springs or just the media needing a anti gun story to run with on a slow news day?",

It would be cool to something in your sig that you've been here since the beginning.</div></blockquote><br /><br />You are number 596 out of the active members. Problem was when site first started are anti-bot stuff wasnt that great and we got a lot of spam and bot accounts. That is part fo the reason I am deleting users from that time era. As the site gets older I will start to just make old accounts that are not used for a year just become inactive. So it is hard to tell how many of the first 25-50 members are still active because I have deleted so many (100+) accounts from that same time. I can say that of the active members last month (773 members) 97 of them are members that joined in 2009. And out of the 97, 29 do nto even have one post. We have a lot of users who lurk or use this soley for the classifieds and that is fine by me. That is why I started this site.</div></blockquote><br />For anyone who is interested in knowing , you can go to the Members List (upper right hand corner between Search and Logout) click on the Join Date column tab and the software will sort the members by either Newest to Oldest or vice versa. To know what your &quot;Member number is&quot; just click on your screen name to bring up your profile page - look at the URL line and you will see the very end of that line will be a u=### where u= your member number. This works the same way on almost all forum websites. There are 25 lines to a page - for example I'm member #287 but I'm on page 5 or about 122 from the oldest members.",

You would have to send me your light/laser and I would make your holster as soon as i receive your light/laser and ship them both back to you. They are $95.00 shipped",

Call ahead of time just to be sure. <br /><br />jamie (Owner) over at arkansas sportsman will normally meet or beat any gun price in arkansas. I have bought numerous guns there and referred quite a few other people there who purchased guns as well with nothing but praises about the price, service and help they received. I had to order a few through them inwhich they proceeded to show me what their cost was and what I would be paying which is something I love about doing business there. <br /><br />Business is located in an old bank building and is crammed packed with ammo, firearms, and supplies. <span style=\"color: #0000FF\">If its hard to find or in great demand they are definately the go to place to get it.</span> <br /><br />He has sold more S&amp;W M&amp;P shields than anyone else I have contacted about purchasing one. Most stores have gotten less than 6 since the shot show in jan and they average 1-2 a month coming in to be sold. That should give you an idea of the volume of guns being moved through this store. <br /><br />Great selection of Tactical fire arms from AR's to Ak's low end AR's as well as High End. <br /><br />Also has a decent used inventory of weapons.<br /><br />Some old timers hang out there on occasion and are nice to strike up a conversation with as well. <br /><br />Contact me by pm if you have any questions.</div></blockquote><br /><br /> <img src=\"./images/smilies/+1.gif\" alt=\":+1:\" title=\"Plus 1\" /> <br /><br />But don't forget VIrgil!! <br /><br />The only reason I plug these guys, other than price, is thier approach to buisness. I've never been or have seen anyone scoffed at for anything in his store, including rediculous stupid questions. I also challenged them by sending my wife, alone, to buy a pistol. Same decent treatment went to her as it goes to people who spend thousands with Jamie monthly. If it wasn't for Virgil ansering the phone, I would have passed this shop up. He and Jamie both go far beyond what MOST dealers would have deemed satisfactory in customer service. If you're ever passing Atkins, its deffinatly worth a stop!",

To be fair, they're ammo prices are too high, but not rediculous. They're absolutely outrageous on their pricing of ARs and high cap handguns. Sit back and relax folks. This insanity is going to go away. Do not let yourselves be raped by the scavengers. That $1900 Bushmaster you bought last week is going to be back to $900 before long and believe me, these same guys are not going to give you anywhere near that when you want to trade it.",

I would contact AR Tax and see whats up. Tax should be on services or product sold. They don't charge tax on the product (gun) sold because they didn't sell it, just the service (transfer).",

I can not find any faults in the system but I do now know how it works so I will try to share and see if this helps anyone. <br /><br />When you send a PM the sent message goes to your &quot;Outbox&quot;. Once the person has read (or at least opened) the PM it gets moved to the &quot;Sent&quot; folder. <br /><br />Be careful not to hit &quot;Preview&quot; button as this is just a preview and does not send the PM. I have hit this button several times by accident. Also, make sure you do not delete your sent message until the other person has read it. After you send your PM the browser refreshes to your sent message. If you hit the delete button thinking you are deleting the message you were replying to you might accidentaly be deleting your sent message. <br /><br />I hope this helps clear up any problems or confussion.",

You can find Ralph at any of the local gunshows and he will be at the Hot Springs Gun Show at the end of this month, July 26-27 2014. Look for the Glock Performance Center banner. He is a Glock armorer and is all setup to install night sights, trigger jobs, and other parts on your Glock right there at the show for great prices. Plus, always look for a coupon in the AGT gunshow coupon page for extra discounts. Ralph will go the extra mile to make sure your Glock is done right and he will leave you with a much better gun every time he touches it. Also, due to demand of customers at the gunshow Ralph has started installing M&amp;P night sights. So even though it is the Glock Performance Center he will show your M&amp;P a little love too <img src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /> <br /><br />Rules:<br />- Post any number of your choice (not already taken by another user) between 1 and 100.<br />-Only one number allowed per user.

So i was looking up gun retailers on google and stumbled upon Arguntrader after about 2 hours of looking around.<br /><br />Its a great site and everyone i speak to about firearms ask me where i buy firearms. I always tell them Arguntrader.",

Three total, not 3 of each kind. This morning all they had was some Tula 223 and 7.62x39. I picked up a 100 box of 45 for $35 last week and 3 boxes of 223 today just for giggles. Saw on another post I think a WM in Little Rock had the 100 rd 45's for $40. Wally World is getting ammo in spurts, but they are getting some. Hang tight, check the local stores, and stay away from the gougers.",

I have bought numerous guns there and referred quite a few other people there who purchased guns as well with nothing but praises about the price, service and help they received. I had to order a few through them inwhich they proceeded to show me what their cost was and what I would be paying which is something I love about doing business there. <br /><br />Business is located in an old bank building and is crammed packed with ammo, firearms, and supplies. <span style=\"color: #0000FF\">If its hard to find or in great demand they are definately the go to place to get it.</span> <br /><br />He has sold more S&amp;W M&amp;P shields than anyone else I have contacted about purchasing one. Most stores have gotten less than 6 since the shot show in jan and they average 1-2 a month coming in to be sold. That should give you an idea of the volume of guns being moved through this store. <br /><br />Great selection of Tactical fire arms from AR's to Ak's low end AR's as well as High End. <br /><br />Also has a decent used inventory of weapons.<br /><br />Some old timers hang out there on occasion and are nice to strike up a conversation with as well. <br /><br />Contact me by pm if you have any questions.",

        "content": "Well.......status update time I reckon. MLK WM has had plenty of 38SPL, 5.56 in 20rd boxes and in bulk, 40S&amp;W, some 45ACP in bulk 100rd boxes and 50rd boxes. Seems 9mm and 22LR are still on the hot list, but I have found both in the past week here. If I had not have asked about 22LR specifically, I never would have seen them from the customer side of the counter, but there were several boxes of the Winchester Super X 40gr (100rd red box). I kinda figured them for some 17HMR since the boxes are about the same color. Since they had the WWB 100ct 9mm at the same time, I opted for two of those and one of the 22LR. That was Monday morning Nov 25th I reckon. This past weekend's gun show in Springdale there were plenty of bulk boxes of 22LR this and that........more than WM prices of course, but I figure not armslist gouger prices either. I've been conservative with the 22LR this year, not only due to the short supply at decent prices, but I've been shooting other calibers (those I can readily replenish) more. I'll always be able to shoot something despite trends or supply and demand. Hit Cabelas this past Sunday and their prices were not overly impressive and short supply on decent ammo anyway. Seems there is an influx of Turkish ammo here recently just about everywhere (including WM). Not sure what to think of it, but I'm not buying it just the same as I'm not going for steel cased crap either. Simply walked out of WM this morning with a 50rd box of 44mag for $38.97 which is still a good deal in my book. <br />Hopefully there will be one last go round of decent ammo at decent prices available before the new year. Folks spending on black Friday and whatnot......getting Christmas stuff, buying TVs to resell on craigslist and the whole ordeal of re-sell fever will take priority for some. We just have to make the most of the situation at the time and maybe come out slightly ahead of the jackwagons whom have reorganized their priorities for a short while. <br />Why is it we never hear of a shortage on chocolate?",

Problem was when site first started are anti-bot stuff wasnt that great and we got a lot of spam and bot accounts. That is part fo the reason I am deleting users from that time era. As the site gets older I will start to just make old accounts that are not used for a year just become inactive. So it is hard to tell how many of the first 25-50 members are still active because I have deleted so many (100+) accounts from that same time. I can say that of the active members last month (773 members) 97 of them are members that joined in 2009. And out of the 97, 29 do nto even have one post. We have a lot of users who lurk or use this soley for the classifieds and that is fine by me. That is why I started this site.",

I bought a S&amp;W M&amp;P15/22 Gander was asking $650 for their gun I bought mine from Ft. Thompsons for $400. When i told the guy behind the counter at Gander Mtn.he basically told me i was a liar. I would recommend Ft. Thompsons for any gun you want to buy but they are a little high on everything else in the store. Bullseye Guns and Ammo i have only bought one gun from but they were the only one with the gun on hand but i paid a little more for it but only about $25. They will give you a little better price if you pay cash and check their price on gunbroker to see what they will drop their price to. Their employees are friendly but the Ft. beats them on most prices ive checked. A quick mention on ammo the best price i have found for ammo in the little rock area is the Walmart on McCain Blvd. They are a few dollars cheaper than all the other Walmarts i visit and Walmarts wont price match on ammo even if its another Walmart, almost half price of Gander Mtn. Downfall is they dont have alot of bulk cant usally buy more than 4 or 5 boxes but they have most your popular handgun and rifle cartridges. <br /><br />Ft Thompson- good for gun buys <br />Gander Mtn- Stay away from them unless they are the only option<br />Bullseye Guns and Ammo- pretty good prices my second stop if Ft. Thompsons dont have what i want",

        "content": "Went to fort chaffee outfitters to get my sig p238. Actually put it on lay away. They didnt have one with night sights and weren't sure when they would get one in so i put some after market sight on lay away as well. A week later i went in to pay some more on it and as i walked in the door Danny called me over to the counter to show me two 238's that just came in with night sights.he had thought id like to switch the pistol on lay away with the one with factory night sights. Without a problem he gladly switched them.. these guys are genuinely nice and are great to do business with. I won't buy a new gun from anywhere else and highly recomend stopping in if you're visiting or live in the fort smith area. They have the lowest prices on everything and are great to just chat with (when they're not busy). Awesome guys and very good selection of firearms.",

Usually a one man show at the shop, but he's always willing to look something up. He even came through on a deal for that stainless Taurus 605 I was looking for. I decided to buy it at the price he quoted and I'll be danged if he didn't have one in the shop the very next day. Nice enough guy to just chew the fat with as well. It's not a big shop.

        "content": "Both WM MLK and the Mall WM have had some 5.56 as of Saturday (10/5). The Winchester (red, white, blue) box of 20rd are priced over $12ea, and the Independence boxes of 20rd are like $10.47 each. Haven't seen any .223 or Tula anything in either of these WMs in a while. Here is a case of WM not being the least expensive on the 5.56 brass/reloadable. You can find the brass case 5.56 cheaper online even with shipping. As of yesterday, PSA had the Federal XM193 for $7.99 per box of 20rds. Even Natchez was running a 'closeout' sale this past weekend (had to give a look see since I got email), but the price per round was more even buying at least 500rds and higher shipping as well. Still.....both retailers beating Wal Mart on the 5.56 easily. Even when Wal Mart has the 1000rd cases of 5.56 for $479 or whatever.......they are still higher than what you can buy online including shipping. 500rd cases are going around $195-$215 depending on retailer and what type, but all quality brass cased boxer primed (not even the Romanian 5.56x45 NATO surplus that seems to be prevalent now), but US made stuff. Even if you estimate shipping cost of about $18 per case of 500rds....still cheaper than Wal Mart on the 1K. Just saying......it's all in the math. <br />Speaking of math.........if the federal government defaults on our country's loans....who's going to loan US any money or import anything? Keep checking prices of canned goods and water folks....Wal Mart still has some good deals on those items.",

        "content": "Fay mall WM had Federal .223 100rd bulk, some CCI SV 50ct, and Blazer Brass 9mm 115gr today. 38spl and 17HMR seem to be available consistently although I don't need either of those. The .380Auto seems to be showing up recently as well. It's there, just that I don't concern myself with those particular retail prices. <br /><br />So.....is everybody getting burned out on the ammo search or buying? Getting too close to Christmas I guess? Not posting here...but buying just to put on armslist for profit? I guess whatever trips your trigger, but when I see that WM has it in stock and then I see the stuff on armslist the next day for twice retail.......I'm simply flagging them. Hoping that not many on this forum are profiteering or using information here to do so. <br /><br />Wal Mart has jacked their prices on a lot of ammo recently, but some of what I've been seeing on the shelves recently is still the same as last year. I'm thinking the 45ACP and 44Mag have definitely gone up around $3 per 50ct box, and maybe $5 on the 100ct bulks. But I can find my 240gr 44mag on the shelf any time I've been there. It is what it is I reckon.",

        "content": "Figures. WM has probably paid more to keep the flow coming in and new contracts. Even some of the online pricing beats WM prices on some things now even including shipping. PSA is where I've been doing quite a bit of ammo shopping lately despite them taking near a whole week to get it to me, the shipping costs are reasonable. Last I knew Academy had a one box limit per caliber. Cabelas? Well, I might go there more often, but it's a long drive for me and I'm risking my life just getting on I-540 anytime during daylight hours. <br />I was in the mall WM this morning before 7am to get some motor oil and a battery charger. Well, since the automotive dept. is close to sporting goods I had to swing through and see. Rounded a corner and there were about ten guys hovering around like flies over a fresh turd. Obviously not there for the deer corn. Didn't see much in the ammo display case, so all of the fresh turds must have been behind the counter. One thing I won't do is hover like a fly over a fresh turd nor hang around sporting goods like a beggar waiting for a handout. I did my shopping and left wondering if some of these guys ended up being late for work or went away empty handed after waiting. Either way....we'll see tomorrow what WM did have this morning because most of it will be showing up on armslist for sale no doubt. <br />You know......I just had this thought. Nothing racist or anything, but us white boys ought to feel good knowing that the Mexicans aren't hitting the WM sporting goods department for ammo. You know they are all family and they seem to work as a team way better than us Americans (it's a fact especially when it comes to buying a house or property). If they really wanted to.....I figure they could totally own all of the ammo in NWA within 24 hours. Seriously. Anyway...just a thought, and some of you in this area know that I'm right about that. Again...nothing racist at all. I just know their culture maybe a bit more than some of you. Just something to think about. Mexicans have a large influence on the market around these parts. If you find some humor in that then so be it. It is what it is, but I figure us homies can feel a bit better about having some luck finding any ammo on the shelves at all once in a while.",

        "content": "Yes......idiots...I agree.<br />Once again folks......flag these gougers on armslist selling 22LR and 22WMR ammo as well as bulk 9mm etc...(interestingly enough listed from Rogers and Bentonville). <br />Notice that each time I've posted this sort of thing is that I've said &quot;please&quot; flag these idgets on armslist. Not this time. Why? Because quite frankly I don't need to beg you to take the time to do it. If you would simply realize that doing so would be helping all of us that simply buy ammo to shoot at retail prices. If folks are paying gouger prices on ammo, and idgets are buying it for profit or resale.......then you're not going to find it on the store shelves at retail prices period!<br />Do YOURSELF a favor and get the ammo back on the shelves in your retail store of choice at a decent price and flag these profiteers and scammers. Hell......you don't have to spend gas money doing it! Just 10 minutes flagging as scams on armslist will be well worth it in short time. <br />If you choose to buy from these gougers, or you don't feel that you can come to terms with doing what's best (just like defending yourself against thugs on the street).....then think about this. Would you like to have a nice holiday season? Buy little Jimmy a nice .22 rifle with no ammo for Christmas? Or would you rather line the pockets of thieves with your money to have fun with on Back Friday buying their overpriced ammo? <br />Don't dare for one second tell me that you believe in the principles of what comes around goes around. Make a smart choice and say what's going around is coming down! THE only way you'll see retail ammo at your local retail store anytime soon. Think about how you'd like to start the new year folks. In the same boat? Or a better boat?<br />We are stuck with the big 'O' for another 3 punishing years because we can't vote him out of office now. Changing your world for the better now......despite the hierarchy.....starts with simple things like ruling your own economy with your own simple input. You can vote today to turn the tide of stupid BS right here at home from your own home. Lord give me strength to do what is right? You need to find the strength in yourself to do the right thing now. No better time than now. Later is a distant past...and of course way too late for now....and obviously something that should have been done way before now...otherwise we wouldn't be in this predicament now. Doing nothing gets nobody anywhere...somewhere is better than nowhere. Think about the English language with all of it's twists and meanings.....I've heard it is the most difficult language on the planet to learn. Now......think of yourself speaking fluent Russian or Chinese in the next year. You think you can't do it? What if you were going to be put to death if you couldn't speak the new language? Would you start learning the new language today? Or would you take up your arms and make a stand saying it aint gonna happen here in America? <br />I truly wish each and everyone here a happy, fulfilling, and wholesome holiday season this year from the bottom of my heart. Enjoy now for who knows what things will be like next holiday season or if our current government will even allow it to happen. Start now ruling out one asshole at a time, and I think next year will be a better one. Maybe my hopes are too high....but at least I have some hopes. How about you?<br />I wouldn't have posted this full page reply to a thread other than hoping that it will probably be a lot more interesting reading and thought-provoking than your local daily news. Anyone here watch the local daily news?",

Full lines of Springfield Arms, Glock, Ruger, Taurus and many others. There ammo selection is cheap compared to pawn shop and other gun shops in the area. They seem to have every caliber I have thought of. Along with hand guns, they also have a very large selection of hunting and defense rifles.<br /><br />They have a very small tackle section, but its worth a look. They have 6' Carrot Sticks for $120!<br /><br />If you're in the area, its worth a peak for any gun lover.",

It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government's reckless fiscal policies. Increasing America 's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that, &quot;the buck stops here.' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better.” </span></span><span style=\"color: #FF0040\">~ Senator Barack H. Obama, March 2006!</span><br />.<br />.<br />What a piece of s---!",
