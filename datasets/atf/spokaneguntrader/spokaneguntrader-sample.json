Perhaps the single best bullet ever made of the expanding variety was the demonized Winchester Black Talon. It flat WORKED. It expanded perfectly, it would not plug up, it penetrated well. The early tests with the 180gr 357 load (1150 fps) were devastating on muflon sheep. Thick, dense, wool coat on a 250lb animal and they were getting pass thru penetration. Hogs fell to the 45 loads just as well.<br />Other very good HP's are the Golden Sabre, XTP and Hydra Shock. Of these I am presently carrying XTP's.<br /><br />But any expanding bullet has limitations and if the bad guy is behind cover you need better results. This was where the Hornady 230gr Truncated Cone flat point FMJ came in. Better energy transfer (stopping power) than any RN bullet, better penetration than any HP bullet. To my mind this is perhaps the single best all around bullet ever made for the 45ACP. Hornady discontinued the bullet a few years back, but Nosler also makes this design. If you can get some I suggest buying them.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I agree with your analysis. However there is a 230 grain truncated cone design that is equal to either the Hornady or the Nosler FMJ. It's the Lee bullet mold TL452-230-TC and each bullet that you load will cost less money than jacketed or even plated. Also the Winchester TSX is supposed to work as well as the black Talons. <br /><br />Hardcast, It's a great bullet. I load mine with 5.7 gr. unique powder and it's a slightly Plus P+ load in my gun's barrel developing close to 900 fps. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Do not use jacketed load data with these bullets.</span> Lubricated lead bullets will develop higher velocities with less pressure than copper jacketed because of less friction. I lube mine with Lee liquid alox and they work great.<br /><br />All you need to do to get into bullet casting is find a 1000 watt hotplate at a thrift store and a stainless copper bottomed revereware type pot at a thrift store or otherwise they sell online for not much money but they have to be 1000 watts. then get a Lyman ladle and some kind of flux and you're good to go except that you need a well ventilated place to work with an exhaust fan where no one will complain about the smell. a five gallon bucket is good too, to drop the bullets into and it will also temper the bullets. I also recommend a Teflon coated muffin pan as an ingot mold so that you can save batches oflead according to hardness.<br /><br />A lee lead furnace works a lot better than a sauce pan and a ladle and considering that a good ladle costs about half the price of he lee bottom-pour electric furnace it's not much money to upgrade. but I've done it with the saucepan and the hotplate and a tablespoon with wooden broomhandle halves duct-taped onto the spoon handle back in the day when I didn't have much money.<br /><br />My mold casts the bullets about .453 and about 245 grains with slightly harder than wheelweight alloy which is then made harder by the quenching. He higher concentration of tin and antimony in your led mixture the less the bullet will shrink so therefore harder bullets will be larger diameter than soft and soft bullet will be heavier than alloyed bullets so relative hardness can be accurately determined by miking the diameter and weighing the bullets. With every batch of lead I save in ingots I include one cast bullet with that bunch of ingots and that will tell me the hardness relative to other batches with the same bullet<br /><br /><br /><img src=\"http://i58.tinypic.com/35jcluf.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />","date_posted": "Wed Feb 04, 2015 12:28 pm","signature": "Government is not reason, it is not eloquence \u2014 it is force.

They were setup to deal with soft aluminum, so the hard anodizing of an AR lower was a challenge. Edges chipped, letters not big enough to be sharp. It's too bad. Not throwing these guys under the bus, but if they use a diamond engraving tip, there will be issues. Laser or carbide cutter in a CNC 3 axix milling machine seem to be the way to go if you want it to look good.<br /><br />I'd ask them if they've ever done engraving on AR's, and ask for references and to see examples of their work, particularly when it comes to NFA stuff because NFA is like luggage - you're gonna keep it forever, so you might as well do it right. That being said, I've also seen NFA that was done by hand, and looked like it. I like my stuff to be nice and to look like it was done professionally. Other people may not care.

Your idea wouldn't work as you would wish as the shot-shell chamber would be ~.45 cal for slightly more than the length of the shell it's chambered for prior to its reduction to .410.

The 44/40 is a bottleneck case which uses a 428 diameter bullet with a case head size similar to 45 Colt. shotgun chambers have forcing cones which amount to a lot of &quot;freebore&quot; and what's interesting is when you fire a 44-40 in a .410 smoothbore by the time the slug leaves the that barrel it sounds like velocity is reduced and it give off a very mild report instead of a &quot;bang!&quot; Keep in mind that most 44-40 ammo is loaded down so that it won't hurt any old guns. I didn't try chrongraphing it to see what eh velocity was. A 38-40 uses a .40 caliber bullet and could also be used.<br /><br />Could the 44-40 be safely loaded hotter to improve on the ballistic of a 90 grain (1/5th Oz.) .410 hollowbase rifled slug? Maybe. Or maybe you could load a 38-40 with a cast .41 caliber bullet intended for the 44 mag. But in the ,410, I kind of like the Winchester Super-X 410 Bore 3&quot; 000 Buckshot 5 Pellets load. A single 000 buck pellet is 36 caliber and weighs 70 grains. that's a payload of 350 grains @ 1100 fps which in my way of thinking is pretty respectable. It's probably only about 800 fps out of a short barreled judge or governor but that's still not bad and probably the best load you can use out of one of those guns next to a plus P+ 45 colt load.","date_posted": "Fri Feb 13, 2015 11:24 pm","signature": "Government is not reason, it is not eloquence \u2014 it is force.

Its crap. 7mm holes in the black are hard to find unless things are perfect. Either their QC is hit and miss and I just got a bad one, or they lowered the standards after their initial US sales to gain productivity. Either way, mine is crap and his is great. Will have to look into this Celestron.","date_posted": "Tue Mar 03, 2015 8:44 pm","signature": "Profanity is the crutch of the illiterate mind.

,{"posts": [{"content": "last year or maybe the year before, Nosler came out with the 26 nosler which to me seemed like a little bit too much of a good thing even though I love most all 6.5 caliber cartridges and I always figured that the 264 Winchester got a bad rap when people said it burned up barrels because it was too much of an over bore cartridge. I never thought that was true but I think that the 26 nosler actually is a little bit overbore and as a result it would not have very good barrel life.<br /><br />But that round was kind of a sp4ecialty thing and was chambered in an expensive rifle for people who have the kind of money to pay for that level of performance and not worry about long term use.<br /><br />But now they necked it up to 7mm and now I think they might have something there. The case is fatter than a magnum case but the rim is rebated to the size of a magnum case and the case is longer than the WSM cases but shorter than the Remington RUM cases which are close to the length (and case capacity) of the .338 Lapua with the 7mm RUM having an OAL of 3.600. which is also the OAL of the 7mm STW. The 28 nosler has an OAL of 3.340 and will work in 30-06 length actions.<br /><br />It will drive a 175 gr Nosler AccuBond boat-tail spitzer 3,125 ft/s. and a 160 grainer 3,300 fps. That's out of a 26 inch barrel which I don't see as a handicap. I've handled model 70 Winchesters that were made back in the 1950s in 300 H&amp;H caliber with 26 inch barrels and those guns had a really nice feel and balance to them with the 26 inch barrel. and If I could find a used Ruger number one in 7 rem mag I might want to rechamber it for this round.","date_posted": "Mon Feb 16, 2015 11:14 pm","signature": "Government is not reason, it is not eloquence \u2014 it is force.

,{"posts": [{"content": "Just some good 'ol knowledge from one of the top guys in the firearm industry. From the M4carbine.net news letter;<br /><br />Part II <br /><br />m4carbine.net news, Ken Hackathorn's take Part 2 and more...<br /><br />Ken Hackathorn's Take<br />Sage wisdom from the grandfather of the gun industry: PART 2<br />I am constantly amazed at the number of people I meet that think they can fix the problem of self-defense by purchasing the ideal handgun. For much of the CCW crowd, this is defined as the small .380 that they can carry in their pocket with ease. To others, the choice may be a custom 1911 or Glock 17. Few people really consider the 'reality' of what happens in 90% of self-defense scenarios. Shootings and gunfights involving handguns take place at close range....police, military, &amp; private sector all share these facts. Some folks will tell you that pistol marksmanship skills should include 25 and even 50 yard precision abilities.<br /><br />While being able to shoot well at long range is nice, and a desirable skill, it really has little to do with reality. People that try to sell you on the importance of this are simply way off course of needs vs. wants. The ability to make a head shot at 5 yards in 2.5 seconds is far more critical than the ability to hit a torso at 50 yards in 4.0 sec. Let's be real here about all those folks that carry these little .22, .25, .32 &amp; 380 pocket guns: they are perfect self-defense guns as long as they never need them! Luckily, most people that carry guns will probably never need to use them, thus a little blaster will work just fine. I get it, any gun is better than a sharp stick, but, if you ever need to defend yourself or your family, you want a gun that you can shoot accurately and effectively under stress.<br /><br />I am often asked about calibers of choice. When I first got into this business back in the 1970s the gun of choice was either a .357 Mag revolver or .45acp 1911. Typically the 45 1911 was popular in the holsters of the 'gun guys', most of whom could shoot far better than the average gunner. Today, I note a high percentage of those who pack a .45 acp caliber handguns have the attitude that while they know they are poor shots or not highly skilled with a sidearm, the .45acp round will solve the problem even if they can only achieve peripheral hits. Kind of the mindset that a 45 hit in the little finger will make the targets head explode. Guess what, it does not work that way. One is always better off with a weapon you can use with skill, caliber is secondary to shot placement. <br /><br />After all these years, it is my belief that a .45 round is about 10% better than a 9X19mm.....ball round vs ball round or JHP vs JHP. Ten percent isn't much unless your life is at stake--then it is a whole lot On the other hand, if you told me that I have to carry a 9X19mm pistol, I'm not going to throw a hissy fit. A nine will work just fine if you can place the round where it needs to be. It is not the number of shots fired, or the splits between the shots fired that matters (anytime I hear some talk about 'splits', I push the delete button on them......splits don't mean sh*t in the real world). While all of us would choose a gun that holds more bullets, how often does round capacity really matter in the real world? If you miss a lot, then high capacity handguns are a great choice. Remember, shootings and gunfights are generally won by those that hit their targets with accurate shots. <br /><br />Like many of the M4Carbine.net fans, I enjoy testing and trying new handguns and gear. There are huge numbers of excellent sidearms on the market to choose from. Every year we see more and more entries. What matters is that you pick one that works for you and you can use well. For most of us that means a handgun that you can afford to practice and maintain your skill with. For most, based upon much of what I have seen over the past few decades, I recommend guns like the Glock 17 and 19. I have both, but if I could have only one it would be the G-19. For the money it is a slam dunk choice. I love 1911 pistols, carry one daily and have total faith in my 1911s. I'm constantly asked to recommend a 'good 1911'. I typically reply, &quot;buy a Wilson Combat&quot;. This usually gets a response of something like: Wilson Combat 1911\u2019s are really expensive. Yep. If you can't afford one, maybe you should select another pistol design. Quality of the 1911 pistol in the main stream market varies widely. <br /><br /><br /><br />Currently I see excellent results with Springfield Armory 1911 pistols. The Colt 1911 pistols made today are some of the best 1911s Colt has ever made. Maybe not up to prewar standards, but compared to the guns made from 1980 and on, the current guns are excellent. I have three different Colts made over the last few years and they are outstanding guns right out of the box. I have been shooting an H&amp;K VP9 since last Summer and I consider it one of the best 9X19mm pistols on the market. I have a couple of 9X19mm S&amp;W MPs that have been tweaked and work well. <br /><br />While many people like to \u201cMF\u201d the Beretta M9/92, I think they are great pistols, overly large for most CCW purposes, but extremely reliable and soft shooting. I find them to be very accurate out of the box and great for belt holster carry. I am not a big fan of the .40S&amp;W. Carried one as a duty sidearm, have a few, but the caliber just never 'rang' for me. What I can tell you about sidearm choice and recommendation is very simple. Whatever gun you choose, practice with it doing drills that reflect 'real world' requirements. Never accept mediocre skill, get it right, and never leave the range saying 'I suck'. If you do, you have already planned the outcome of the fight when that moment comes. And no matter what.....be aware of your environment. Don't be the one surprised.<br /><br />-Ken Hackathorn","date_posted": "Fri Feb 27, 2015 1:15 pm","signature": "<span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">&quot;There is a savage beast in every man, and when you hand that man a sword or spear and send him forth to war, the beast stirs.&quot;</span></span></div>","title": "Some words of advice from Ken Hackathorn","user_attributes": [{"label": "Posts:","value": "275"},{"label": "Joined:","value": "Tue Oct 16, 2012 11:43 pm"},{"label": "City, State:","value": "CDA"},{"label": "Favorite Firearm:","value": "HK VP9"},{"label": "Next Firearm:","value": "Glock 43"}],"user_tag": "Gun Trader","username": "WickedWillis"},{"content": "Very good post. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />","date_posted": "Fri Feb 27, 2015 3:46 pm","signature": "&quot;Live Long and Prosper&quot;<br />&quot;I am a sheepdog, I live to protect the flock and confront the wolf&quot; Lt.

,{"posts": [{"content": "Hey guys and gals,<br /><br />We created this account to seperate my personal and business stuff on SGT. All postings under this account are for Double Eagle Pawn on Francis but may be available in Deer Park and/or on Sprague. Now a little about us:<br /><br />We are the largest pawn shop in Washington with over 6000 sq ft of general merchandise and over 4000 sq ft of guns and shooting/hunting accessories. We are stocking dealers for most major firearm manufactures like Kimber, Remington, Smith and Wesson, Glock, Springfield, Sig Sauer, FN, Savage, Taurus, Ruger, Kel-Tec, CZ, Mossberg, EAA, Colt, and so on and so on with 1800+ new and used firearms on display. We accept cash, Master Card, Visa, and offer a 90 day lay-a-way with 25% down and no additional charges or fixed payment schedule. In addition to firearms we carry a large selection of ammo, reloading supplies, AR-15 build parts, holsters, hunting supplies (firearms and archery), shooting supplies, and cleaning accessories (Including Froglube!). Come in and see us! You will be impressed!<br /><br />We are happy to special order any gun or supplies you may be looking for.<br /><br />We also buy guns and take trade in's on gun purchases. Remember, you get a tax credit on the amount of your firearms trade in toward your new purchase. For example if you buy a firearm for 500 and trade in a gun valued at 400 you only pay tax on the 100 difference! We are open 7 days a week Mon-Sat 9am to 6pm and open Sunday from 10am to 5pm.<br /><br />*We currently do not do FFL transfers","date_posted": "Wed Dec 05, 2012 10:33 am","signature": "Cash, Credit, or 90 day Lay-A-Way, same low price!</div>","title": "Hello All","user_attributes": [{"label": "Posts:","value": "23"},{"label": "Joined:","value": "Wed Dec 05, 2012 9:53 am"},{"label": "Location:","value": "315 E Francis Spokane WA 509-487-1644"},{"label": "City, State:","value": "Spokane"}],"user_tag": "Local SGT Sponsor","username": "Double Eagle Francis"}],"topic_id": "37808","topic_title": "Hello All","url": "http://www.spokaneguntrader.com/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=37808&p=184946"}

I'm either thinking about a new .22LR or Mag or just bucking up and getting a bolt gun in .223 which can be super cheap and accurate. <br /><br />If I go rimfire ammo being available might be a concern. <br /><br />Centerfire might cost a little more <br /><br />One thing I had considered is going with like a .308 or 30-06 and using the varmint hunting to tune in my handloads. at that point if I can easily hit squirrels all day at 100 plus yards taking an elk should be no issue. But there again for elk hunting I'm gonna want a heavy solid bullet that will retain its weight where as for squirrels I want a light weight fast projectile to blast them to smithereens. So maybe buying a .223 bolt gun and using it and squirrel shooting just to hone my abilities so that when I pick up the 30-06 I am a more capable shooter. <br /><br />Thoughts?","date_posted": "Mon Mar 16, 2015 6:48 am","signature": "92 Bronco XLT with a rebuilt transmission for 3K clean title ready to go.</div>","title": "Deciding on a varmint gun Thinking bolt .223","user_attributes": [{"label": "Posts:","value": "624"},{"label": "Joined:","value": "Mon Mar 14, 2011 8:38 am"},{"label": "Location:","value": "Spokane"},{"label": "City, State:","value": "Spokane"},{"label": "Favorite Firearm:","value": "Sig Sauer P220"},{"label": "Next Firearm:","value": "Kimber Pro Carry"}],"user_tag": "SGT Premium Supporter","username": "countryman"},{"content": "There is a lot of wisdom in your thought about using your primary hunting rifle for your varmint gun. There is no better way to tune your skills than actually shooting under field conditions.

Very little recoil, mild muzzle blast, etc. As well as less expensive to shoot. The 22LR is also great, but as you metioned there is a problem with ammo at this time.

That said, when I was in the market looking myself a number of years back I ended up buying a Savage in 223. I shot the heck out of that rifle until I started finding myself shooting it as much on the range as I did in the field, so I rebarreled it to 243.

Otherwise a 223 or even a 243 isn't a bad consideration. Nice thing if you go with a Savage center fire is that if you want to at some point you can rebarrel it yourself to a different caliber. It's one of the reasons I like Savage rifles is the ability to tear down and rebuild it pretty cheaply myself, which is worth considering if you're like me and 1) Have limited financial resources, and 2) Tend to change your mind about what interests you frequently.

When I have a short supply of rimfire I do limit it and I'm pretty strict about the limits. Like when a husband has 4 boxes and his wife right behind him has 4 boxes I don't allow it. I want the ammo to go to the people who are going to shoot it and/or needs ammo for the kids to shoot. When I have lots of ammo, any yes Armscor is the only company who can deliver in quantity, I have no limits.<br /><br />Now, to the purchase mentioned. Point #1 is he bought 22 mag not 22 LR. I remember the transaction like yesterday. #2 I had close to 25,000 more rounds on the shelf in the back so I actually thought it was kinda funny he was thinking that he was buying me out. Made me smile when I restocked the shelf right after he left.<br /><br />As to the cost. It seems to me like everyone assumes we are marking prices up. I actually pay over 4.00 a 50 pack for Armscor direct from Armscor that cost is up from the 2.17 that I used to pay for the same stuff and sold for 2.99 at that time. I buy it because I get lots of other ammo from them like 10mm and the 45ACP that I can sell for 19.99 for a 50 pack of range ammo.<br /><br />If any of you EVER have a question about something at Double Eagle on Francis please speak to me directly. I'm the manager in the gun room (the big bald guy) and my personal handle on SGT is Aarons312.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />Travis</div></blockquote><br />Thank you very much for that clarification.

Rick has been my gunsmith since he started doing it full-time. He was good at it from the beginning and now he has even more experience. Scott, the guy who owns the shop is also a damn good gunsmith in his own right and a nice guy to boot. We need to give these guys all the business we can so they can afford to get a lathe and a mill and start doing some advanced custom work.<br /><br />I need to mention that the reason the shop's same is firearms finishing is because they do bluing, duracote and ceracote. Scott knows how to restore worn or rusted or dinged blued gun and not harm the original edges or lettering. He did a Belgian Browning 22 SA takedown for me and reproduced the original blued perfectly. I restored the wood, and I'm pretty good at doing that, but he's even better than I am.<br /><br />If you happen to be old-school like me and want a gun with a righteous blued finish and a figured walnut stock, he's the man to see. Or if you have and older blued Smith and wesson that isn't a rare model or variation and needs refinishing he can duplicate the original factory finish and you can have a gun that is a thing of beauty. I think he can even restore nickle plate. Or if you like cerekote, he has it in Black and a really cool shade of purple that's more of a &quot;Plum&quot; color.","date_posted": "Thu Dec 04, 2014 10:37 am","signature": "Government is not reason, it is not eloquence \u2014 it is force.

The other advantage is velocity increase. General rule of thumb is that you will gain anywhere between 25 and 50 fps per added inch of barrel length. The attached link shows that a 147 grain 9mm which develops 951 Fps out a 4 inch barrel will do 1073 fps out of a 16 inch carbine barrel and the Speer Gold do 124 grain load which does 1203 fps out of a 4 inch barrel will do 1395 fps out of a 16 inch carbine barrel which basically turns a 9mm into a 357 magnum.<br /><br />Similarly a 16 inch barrel will turn a 40 S&amp;W into a 10mm.<br /><br />My brother has a Mac 10 in 9mm and a good friend of mine has a Kel-tec sub 2000. Someone else that I know has a Hi-point, all in 9mm. I've fired all 3 on numerous occasions and like them all. The high point is a nice gun but I think that it's just plain WRONG for a semi-auto sub gun not to have a hi-cap mag. No one in the right mind would pay $1200 bucks for a semi-auto Thompson that only accepted ten round mags. Someone like Magpul needs to make hi-caps for the Hi-points. In my experience all of the hi-point guns are reliable and accurate and are inexpensive but are not &quot;Cheap&quot; or of poor quality.<br /><br />The original semi auto mac 10s were good guns but later versions had problems and are to be avoided. My brother was able to modify his to work right and also adapted it to accept 30 round steel magazines of a much better quality than the ten rounders and even some of the larger capacity mags that were made for the newer guns.<br /><br />The Kel-tecs are nice and the best thing about them is they Accept Glock factory 33 round mags or any other glock mag in 9mm and 40. My friend's Keltec has always been 100% reliable as far as feed and function and is reasonably accurate. Some were made to accept smith and Wesson or Beretta mags but I would not want one of those. My friend had his sights go out of alignment once but was able to fix it. I'm thinking that Red dot sights are the way to go on these guns.<br /><br />As far as the mechtec uppers, they work well and I've been wanting to get one for my Glock 20 which would give me 41 magnum ballistics out of a 16 inch barrel<br />but have been holding off because of the cost. the basic unit is +-$350-400 but then you need a stock and have to buy that extra and then you need sights because it only comes with a rail and so by the time you're done you've spent $5-600 or more depending on the sights plus the cost of your Glock or 1911 for the carbine.<br /><br />And then you're stuck with the problem of &quot;What gun shall I take with me today, my Glock 20 handgun, or my Glock 20 carbine?&quot; and then you start thinking of getting another Glock 20 for another $4-500 bucks or so, so that you can have both the pistol AND the carbine. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /> <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.mechtechsys.com/\">http://www.mechtechsys.com/</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.ballisticsbytheinch.com/9luger.html\">http://www.ballisticsbytheinch.com/9luger.html</a><!-- m -->","date_posted": "Thu Feb 26, 2015 10:21 am","signature": "Government is not reason, it is not eloquence \u2014 it is force.

An FMJ will punch a 3/8th of an inch hole straigtht through B'rer Rabbit and a headshot will destroy no edible meat regardless. And if you learn to reload a heavy cast bullet is even better. I used to reload my 9mm Smith and Wesson model 39 with the same 158 grain bullets that I used in the 38 special using Unique powder and they cycled the action perfectly and developed about 850 fps. Out of a carbine that would be about 11-1200 fps.<br /><br />Getting high velocity out of your ammo is NOT the point of a pistol caliber carbine. It's just an added advantage depending on the ammo you use and reloading not only allows you to shoot more ammo, it gives you versatility. There main point of a pistol caliber carbine is a more stable shooting platform that affords the shooter grater practical accuracy than with a handgun particularly with optics.<br /><br />9mm brass is cheap and plentiful especially if you don't just <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">limit</span> yourself to what's available locally. It's no big deal to send away for brass or projectiles, and cast bullets are cheaper than jacketed. And if you cast your own, it's cheaper yet. I have cast bullets using an electric hot plate and a revereware stainless 3 quart sauce pan that I bought at a thrift store for well under 20 bucks but then I busted the bank and spent another $15-20 bucks on a Lyman Lead ladle that I got from white Elephant. That was a few years back and now the ones amazon sells are $ 20 bucks plus $7.49 shipping and the ones White Elephant sells are more so it's almost beter to get a Lee electric furnace from white Elephant for about 80 bucks.<br /><br />White elephant is the reloader's friend. What they don't have, they can order.<br /><br />And at action recycling on Hamilton they let me sort through their scrap lead and one time I found a big box of actual Linotype from and old printing press. Wheelweights are getting harder to find and you have to be carful that they aren't made out of ZINC because a small amount of Zinc will ruin a large amount of lead and make it un suitable for casting. As someone who's been reloading since 1968, the best advice I can give you is to tell you about the most versatile powder in existence which is Unique. some people say that unique is &quot;dirty&quot; but those are just people who tend to be fussy and somewhat anal afraid of getting their hands dirty and don't want to have to ever clean their guns after shooting them and most of all have never shot a black powder cap and ball pistol so they don't know what dirty really is.<br /><br />And what's this about the keltec sub 2000 being expensive? $355 at Impact guns for a 9mm that uses Glock mags. You add FFL and shipping and it costs more than a Hi-point but I can't think of any new handgun that you can buy for und3er $500 much less a pistol caliber carbine. And I'll tell you anoteh excellent pistol caliber carbine and that is the new RIA bolt action in 22 TCM caliber which is a pistol caliber that they chamber in one of their double stack 1911's This little rifle could do anything a 22 Hornet could do and if you were a reloader it could do anything a 22 long rifle could do or a 22 magnum rimfire as well, and they do make bullet molds suitable for this cartridge if you got into casting as well, but 40 to 50 grain 22 jacketed bullets are cheaper per 100 than larger caliber projectiles.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.impactguns.com/brand-kel-tec.aspx\">http://www.impactguns.com/brand-kel-tec.aspx</a><!-- m --><br /><br />&quot;We live in a universe of innumerable possibilities but we are severely handicapped by our own self-imposed limitations.

One time I had to take a front end differential off of a dodge ramcharger 4x4 and drag it out of there and I could have hurt my back doing that but I made sure that I didn't. If someone with less experience than I with muscling around heavy sh*t had hurt their back, Pull and Save couldn't be held responsible.<br /><br />To me, the only thing about liability waivers that isn't good is that as far as I know and from what several Lawyers have told methere is no such thing as an absolute ironclad liability waiver. A good lawyer can find ways around them just as they can with Pre-nuptual agreements. Years ago My parents had land in Colorado at the foot of a Butte that was the highest point for miles around and they owned the land that surrounded it for 40 acres all around it and then another parcel across the highway. Sometimes people would ask if there was a trail to the top and my Dad would tell them that there was but that he couldn't let anyone climb up there for liability reasons. <br /><br />People would argue that if they fell and got hurt that they would never sue but when people do get hurt and are facing medical bills they can change their minds about that in a hurry.<br /><br />A funny story about that place in Colorado was that I was there visiting one time and I wanted my Mom to take my picture at the top of the Butte holding my Dad's 30-30. not long after I had reached the top and was posing for pictures the local Sheriff pulled onto the property in a cloud of dust with lights flashing because he got reports that there was a &quot;Sniper&quot; on the Butte. My mom laughed and said, &quot;Oh that's just our son, he wanted me to take his picture up there.&quot; The sheriff just said, &quot;Tell him I said not to do that anymore.&quot;","date_posted": "Tue Mar 10, 2015 2:47 pm","signature": "Government is not reason, it is not eloquence \u2014 it is force.

The club has elections every December for executive positions: president, vice president, secretary, treasurer and executive officer.

Great advice for the O P <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /></div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />Agree 100% with that approach which essentially says don't just bitch about it <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">do</span> something about it. I don't like how it's worded either but I really can't imagine a worse case scenario where I could get hurt and they could sue ME. If I hurt someone else that's another story but it would be the same situation if I were out on public land shooting or hunting and I hurt someone else, I would be liable. <br /><br />Also I joined the SRC for a year and then gave it up and prefer to shoot out in the wide open spaces to any range but that's another situation where if you aren't pro-active and involved in making sure those places don't get messed up and shut down that there are going to be fewer of those kinds of places available. Which reminds me, we need to start thinking about schedueling another group range clean-up with spring weather coming. <br /><br />I firmly believe in taking action rather than just complaining. But that's not to say I don't mind complaining and woint yell the loudest when there's nothing I can do when something sucks. But there's a lot of truth in the old saying, &quot;Better to spend five minutes lighting a candle then to spend ten hours cursing the darkness&quot;","date_posted": "Tue Mar 10, 2015 11:46 pm","signature": "Government is not reason, it is not eloquence \u2014 it is force.
