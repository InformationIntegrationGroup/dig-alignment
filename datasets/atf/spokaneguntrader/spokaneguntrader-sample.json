An arrow only travels at about 250 fps and weighs around 400 grains but it penetrates like crazy. Therefore a 230 grain 45 caliber projectile will penetrate better than a 200 grain bullet even if it expands.<br /><br />I don't think that the 45 needs any new gimmicks to make it work better. There are plenty of proven designs that have been shown to work well in actual shootings like the 230 grain Winchester SXT, the Federal Hydra-shock 230 grain and the Speer .45 ACP 230 Grain Gold Dot Hollow Point. I also think that the Hornady 45 Auto+P 220 grain FlexLock\u00ae Critical DUTY ammo is a good design as a result of Hornady having done a lot of R&amp;D and testing of the ammo trying to make it &quot;Barrier Blind&quot;.<br /><br />In a lot of different parts of the country there are an over abundance of feral hogs I'd like to see testing done on those animals with some of these different kinds of ammo, But I'd also like to se the handgun hunter backed up by someone with a rifle in case the handgun ammo fails to make a clean kill. I think that would be a lot more realistic test than ballistic gelatin. Ballistic gelatin is actually formulated to simulate swine muscle tissue, which in turn is comparable to human muscle tissue.","date_posted": "Tue Feb 03, 2015 8:40 pm","post_id": "389983","signature": "Government is not reason, it is not eloquence \u2014 it is force.

However there is a 230 grain truncated cone design that is equal to either the Hornady or the Nosler FMJ. It's the Lee bullet mold TL452-230-TC and each bullet that you load will cost less money than jacketed or even plated. Also the Winchester TSX is supposed to work as well as the black Talons. <br /><br />Hardcast, It's a great bullet. I load mine with 5.7 gr. unique powder and it's a slightly Plus P+ load in my gun's barrel developing close to 900 fps. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Do not use jacketed load data with these bullets.</span> Lubricated lead bullets will develop higher velocities with less pressure than copper jacketed because of less friction. I lube mine with Lee liquid alox and they work great.<br /><br />All you need to do to get into bullet casting is find a 1000 watt hotplate at a thrift store and a stainless copper bottomed revereware type pot at a thrift store or otherwise they sell online for not much money but they have to be 1000 watts. then get a Lyman ladle and some kind of flux and you're good to go except that you need a well ventilated place to work with an exhaust fan where no one will complain about the smell. a five gallon bucket is good too, to drop the bullets into and it will also temper the bullets. I also recommend a Teflon coated muffin pan as an ingot mold so that you can save batches oflead according to hardness.<br /><br />A lee lead furnace works a lot better than a sauce pan and a ladle and considering that a good ladle costs about half the price of he lee bottom-pour electric furnace it's not much money to upgrade. but I've done it with the saucepan and the hotplate and a tablespoon with wooden broomhandle halves duct-taped onto the spoon handle back in the day when I didn't have much money.<br /><br />My mold casts the bullets about .453 and about 245 grains with slightly harder than wheelweight alloy which is then made harder by the quenching. He higher concentration of tin and antimony in your led mixture the less the bullet will shrink so therefore harder bullets will be larger diameter than soft and soft bullet will be heavier than alloyed bullets so relative hardness can be accurately determined by miking the diameter and weighing the bullets. With every batch of lead I save in ingots I include one cast bullet with that bunch of ingots and that will tell me the hardness relative to other batches with the same bullet<br /><br /><br /><img src=\"http://i58.tinypic.com/35jcluf.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />","date_posted": "Wed Feb 04, 2015 12:28 pm","post_id": "390041","signature": "Government is not reason, it is not eloquence \u2014 it is force.

I didn't look at the picture closely enough to see that it is not a hollowpoint. None the less, I still think that you might get more penetration with a heavier hardcast or fmj bullet but maybe not. The fact that it has a nose that is fluted might make it penetrate like a round nose yet still has some sharp edges just like a semi-wadcutter or a truncated cone bullet with a large meplat to prevent it from glancing off of a bear's skull. <br /><br />They do make these bullets for th4e 10mm, but in spite of however effective the bullet design may be they only offer it a 140 grain bullet weight and their 230 hardcast would penetrate much better than any 140 grain and if this bullet design were truly effective it would be better in a 200 grain bullet in the 10mm. A 140 grain bullet in 40 caliber has little better sectional density than a roundball.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://i60.tinypic.com/10wprhk.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />","date_posted": "Wed Feb 04, 2015 9:28 pm","post_id": "390145","signature": "Government is not reason, it is not eloquence \u2014 it is force.

They said that because the 45 ACP has a shorter and wider powder column that they could get an adequate amount of powder in the case even with the projectile taking up much of the space. But with the 10mm, the 140 grain bullet was as long as a 200 grain lead core bullet and the wasn't enough room for powder.<br /><br />I suggested that they do a comparison with their 220 grain hardcast load for the 10mm and the lady who replied to my email said she though that was a good idea and that she would suggest that they try it.<br /><br />The one thing copper bullets have going for them is decent sectional density but weighing less, they have less momentum for penetration, so it's kind of a trade off.<br /><br />So the 200 grain 45 is probably the optimum load with one of these bullets and now I understand why Mister Flawlessfootloose is so intrigued by this round.

They were setup to deal with soft aluminum, so the hard anodizing of an AR lower was a challenge. Edges chipped, letters not big enough to be sharp. It's too bad.

I've never owned an AR but I qualified with one in the military a long time ago. I never liked them and then when they finally improved them I just have thought that now they've just become too expensive of an addiction especially if you want one both in 5.56 AND a more decent chambering. I also have never dealt with NFA Firearms not wanting to get that cozy with the feds. But I sure hear what you're saying about if you're going to pay good money to get it done that you want it to look sharp and like factory and like it belongs there. Even if you can get it done cheap it's not worth doing if it looks sh*tty.<br /><br />So yeah, make sure whoever does it can do a decent job or don't let them do it. Maybe using laser might work on the kind of billet aluminum or whatever that's used on AR receivers","date_posted": "Sun Feb 08, 2015 11:15 am","post_id": "390630","signature": "Government is not reason, it is not eloquence \u2014 it is force.

The 44/40 is a bottleneck case which uses a 428 diameter bullet with a case head size similar to 45 Colt. shotgun chambers have forcing cones which amount to a lot of &quot;freebore&quot; and what's interesting is when you fire a 44-40 in a .410 smoothbore by the time the slug leaves the that barrel it sounds like velocity is reduced and it give off a very mild report instead of a &quot;bang!&quot; Keep in mind that most 44-40 ammo is loaded down so that it won't hurt any old guns. I didn't try chrongraphing it to see what eh velocity was. A 38-40 uses a .40 caliber bullet and could also be used.<br /><br />Could the 44-40 be safely loaded hotter to improve on the ballistic of a 90 grain (1/5th Oz.) .410 hollowbase rifled slug? Maybe. Or maybe you could load a 38-40 with a cast .41 caliber bullet intended for the 44 mag. But in the ,410, I kind of like the Winchester Super-X 410 Bore 3&quot; 000 Buckshot 5 Pellets load. A single 000 buck pellet is 36 caliber and weighs 70 grains. that's a payload of 350 grains @ 1100 fps which in my way of thinking is pretty respectable. It's probably only about 800 fps out of a short barreled judge or governor but that's still not bad and probably the best load you can use out of one of those guns next to a plus P+ 45 colt load.","date_posted": "Fri Feb 13, 2015 11:24 pm","post_id": "391464","signature": "Government is not reason, it is not eloquence \u2014 it is force.

,{"posts": [{"content": "last year or maybe the year before, Nosler came out with the 26 nosler which to me seemed like a little bit too much of a good thing even though I love most all 6.5 caliber cartridges and I always figured that the 264 Winchester got a bad rap when people said it burned up barrels because it was too much of an over bore cartridge. I never thought that was true but I think that the 26 nosler actually is a little bit overbore and as a result it would not have very good barrel life.<br /><br />But that round was kind of a sp4ecialty thing and was chambered in an expensive rifle for people who have the kind of money to pay for that level of performance and not worry about long term use.<br /><br />But now they necked it up to 7mm and now I think they might have something there. The case is fatter than a magnum case but the rim is rebated to the size of a magnum case and the case is longer than the WSM cases but shorter than the Remington RUM cases which are close to the length (and case capacity) of the .338 Lapua with the 7mm RUM having an OAL of 3.600. which is also the OAL of the 7mm STW. The 28 nosler has an OAL of 3.340 and will work in 30-06 length actions.<br /><br />It will drive a 175 gr Nosler AccuBond boat-tail spitzer 3,125 ft/s. and a 160 grainer 3,300 fps. That's out of a 26 inch barrel which I don't see as a handicap. I've handled model 70 Winchesters that were made back in the 1950s in 300 H&amp;H caliber with 26 inch barrels and those guns had a really nice feel and balance to them with the 26 inch barrel. and If I could find a used Ruger number one in 7 rem mag I might want to rechamber it for this round.","date_posted": "Mon Feb 16, 2015 11:14 pm","post_id": "391864","signature": "Government is not reason, it is not eloquence \u2014 it is force.

The 26 Nosler can drive those same 140 grain projectiles faster than the 264 win but at the cost of shorter barrel life. I think the 26 Nosler would be a better round if they shortened it so that it had less overbore capacity. Ideally it would have less case capacity than it does in it's present form but just a hair more than the 264 win. <br /><br />Obviously, though, Nosler did not want to come out with a round that was basically only a 264 Winchester &quot;Improved&quot; which incidentally would also be nothing more than the German 6.5 x 68 (also known as the 6.5x68mm RWS, 6.5x68mm Sch\u00fcler or the 6.5x68mm Von Hofe Express) They wanted to have the absolute fastest 6.5 known to man.<br /><br /><br />Nosler is indeed a good company, not only local, but family owned.","date_posted": "Tue Feb 17, 2015 10:35 am","post_id": "391904","signature": "Government is not reason, it is not eloquence \u2014 it is force.

,{"posts": [{"content": "Just some good 'ol knowledge from one of the top guys in the firearm industry. From the M4carbine.net news letter;<br /><br />Part II <br /><br />m4carbine.net news, Ken Hackathorn's take Part 2 and more...<br /><br />Ken Hackathorn's Take<br />Sage wisdom from the grandfather of the gun industry: PART 2<br />I am constantly amazed at the number of people I meet that think they can fix the problem of self-defense by purchasing the ideal handgun. For much of the CCW crowd, this is defined as the small .380 that they can carry in their pocket with ease. To others, the choice may be a custom 1911 or Glock 17. Few people really consider the 'reality' of what happens in 90% of self-defense scenarios. Shootings and gunfights involving handguns take place at close range....police, military, &amp; private sector all share these facts. Some folks will tell you that pistol marksmanship skills should include 25 and even 50 yard precision abilities.<br /><br />While being able to shoot well at long range is nice, and a desirable skill, it really has little to do with reality. People that try to sell you on the importance of this are simply way off course of needs vs. wants. The ability to make a head shot at 5 yards in 2.5 seconds is far more critical than the ability to hit a torso at 50 yards in 4.0 sec. Let's be real here about all those folks that carry these little .22, .25, .32 &amp; 380 pocket guns: they are perfect self-defense guns as long as they never need them! Luckily, most people that carry guns will probably never need to use them, thus a little blaster will work just fine. I get it, any gun is better than a sharp stick, but, if you ever need to defend yourself or your family, you want a gun that you can shoot accurately and effectively under stress.<br /><br />I am often asked about calibers of choice. When I first got into this business back in the 1970s the gun of choice was either a .357 Mag revolver or .45acp 1911. Typically the 45 1911 was popular in the holsters of the 'gun guys', most of whom could shoot far better than the average gunner. Today, I note a high percentage of those who pack a .45 acp caliber handguns have the attitude that while they know they are poor shots or not highly skilled with a sidearm, the .45acp round will solve the problem even if they can only achieve peripheral hits. Kind of the mindset that a 45 hit in the little finger will make the targets head explode. Guess what, it does not work that way. One is always better off with a weapon you can use with skill, caliber is secondary to shot placement. <br /><br />After all these years, it is my belief that a .45 round is about 10% better than a 9X19mm.....ball round vs ball round or JHP vs JHP. Ten percent isn't much unless your life is at stake--then it is a whole lot On the other hand, if you told me that I have to carry a 9X19mm pistol, I'm not going to throw a hissy fit. A nine will work just fine if you can place the round where it needs to be. It is not the number of shots fired, or the splits between the shots fired that matters (anytime I hear some talk about 'splits', I push the delete button on them......splits don't mean sh*t in the real world). While all of us would choose a gun that holds more bullets, how often does round capacity really matter in the real world? If you miss a lot, then high capacity handguns are a great choice. Remember, shootings and gunfights are generally won by those that hit their targets with accurate shots. <br /><br />Like many of the M4Carbine.net fans, I enjoy testing and trying new handguns and gear. There are huge numbers of excellent sidearms on the market to choose from. Every year we see more and more entries. What matters is that you pick one that works for you and you can use well. For most of us that means a handgun that you can afford to practice and maintain your skill with. For most, based upon much of what I have seen over the past few decades, I recommend guns like the Glock 17 and 19. I have both, but if I could have only one it would be the G-19. For the money it is a slam dunk choice. I love 1911 pistols, carry one daily and have total faith in my 1911s. I'm constantly asked to recommend a 'good 1911'. I typically reply, &quot;buy a Wilson Combat&quot;. This usually gets a response of something like: Wilson Combat 1911\u2019s are really expensive. Yep. If you can't afford one, maybe you should select another pistol design. Quality of the 1911 pistol in the main stream market varies widely. <br /><br /><br /><br />Currently I see excellent results with Springfield Armory 1911 pistols. The Colt 1911 pistols made today are some of the best 1911s Colt has ever made. Maybe not up to prewar standards, but compared to the guns made from 1980 and on, the current guns are excellent. I have three different Colts made over the last few years and they are outstanding guns right out of the box. I have been shooting an H&amp;K VP9 since last Summer and I consider it one of the best 9X19mm pistols on the market. I have a couple of 9X19mm S&amp;W MPs that have been tweaked and work well. <br /><br />While many people like to \u201cMF\u201d the Beretta M9/92, I think they are great pistols, overly large for most CCW purposes, but extremely reliable and soft shooting. I find them to be very accurate out of the box and great for belt holster carry. I am not a big fan of the .40S&amp;W. Carried one as a duty sidearm, have a few, but the caliber just never 'rang' for me. What I can tell you about sidearm choice and recommendation is very simple. Whatever gun you choose, practice with it doing drills that reflect 'real world' requirements. Never accept mediocre skill, get it right, and never leave the range saying 'I suck'. If you do, you have already planned the outcome of the fight when that moment comes. And no matter what.....be aware of your environment. Don't be the one surprised.<br /><br />-Ken Hackathorn","date_posted": "Fri Feb 27, 2015 1:15 pm","post_id": "393283","signature": "<span style=\"font-style: italic\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">&quot;There is a savage beast in every man, and when you hand that man a sword or spear and send him forth to war, the beast stirs.&quot;</span></span></div>","title": "Some words of advice from Ken Hackathorn","user_attributes": [{"label": "Posts:","value": "275"},{"label": "Joined:","value": "Tue Oct 16, 2012 11:43 pm"},{"label": "City, State:","value": "CDA"},{"label": "Favorite Firearm:","value": "HK VP9"},{"label": "Next Firearm:","value": "Glock 43"}],"user_tag": "Gun Trader","username": "WickedWillis"},{"content": "Very good post. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />","date_posted": "Fri Feb 27, 2015 3:46 pm","post_id": "393297","signature": "&quot;Live Long and Prosper&quot;<br />&quot;I am a sheepdog, I live to protect the flock and confront the wolf&quot; Lt.

It seems like that sometimes happens also.</div></blockquote><br /><br />My pet peeve is when people delet the listed/sold price after the item sells.... please leave that info so we know what that model has recently sold for.","date_posted": "Sat Feb 19, 2011 3:07 pm","post_id": "45729","signature": "Fortuna Favet Fortibus.<br /><br />When you run out of valid things to say, there's always insults.</div>","title": "  Report this postReply with quote  <h3 >Re: Marking Items as Sold and the Classifieds Archive Section...","user_attributes": [{"label": "Posts:","value": "2224"},{"label": "Joined:","value": "Fri Jun 25, 2010 1:51 pm"},{"label": "Location:","value": "Spokane Valley, WA"},{"label": "City, State:","value": "Spokane Valley"},{"label": "Favorite Firearm:","value": "1911's and AR15's"},{"label": "SGT Supporter:","value": "Yes"}],"user_tag": "SGT Premium Supporter","username": "Coug91"},{"content": "Self archive if you are the thread owner might save you some work.","date_posted": "Sat Feb 19, 2011 5:04 pm","post_id": "45743","signature": "","title": "  Report this postReply with quote  <h3 >Re: Marking Items as Sold and the Classifieds Archive Section...","user_attributes": [{"label": "Posts:","value": "1072"},{"label": "Joined:","value": "Sun Nov 29, 2009 8:30 am"},{"label": "City, State:","value": "Spokane (North), WA"},{"label": "Favorite Firearm:","value": "SAA"},{"label": "Next Firearm:","value": "AR10 .260"},{"label": "SGT Supporter:","value": "Yes"}],"user_tag": "SGT Premium Supporter","username": "LostInWA"}],"topic_id": "393","topic_title": "Marking Items as Sold and the Classifieds Archive Section...","url": "http://www.spokaneguntrader.com/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=393&p=45743"}

All postings under this account are for Double Eagle Pawn on Francis but may be available in Deer Park and/or on Sprague. Now a little about us:<br /><br />We are the largest pawn shop in Washington with over 6000 sq ft of general merchandise and over 4000 sq ft of guns and shooting/hunting accessories. We are stocking dealers for most major firearm manufactures like Kimber, Remington, Smith and Wesson, Glock, Springfield, Sig Sauer, FN, Savage, Taurus, Ruger, Kel-Tec, CZ, Mossberg, EAA, Colt, and so on and so on with 1800+ new and used firearms on display. We accept cash, Master Card, Visa, and offer a 90 day lay-a-way with 25% down and no additional charges or fixed payment schedule. In addition to firearms we carry a large selection of ammo, reloading supplies, AR-15 build parts, holsters, hunting supplies (firearms and archery), shooting supplies, and cleaning accessories (Including Froglube!). Come in and see us! You will be impressed!<br /><br />We are happy to special order any gun or supplies you may be looking for.<br /><br />We also buy guns and take trade in's on gun purchases. Remember, you get a tax credit on the amount of your firearms trade in toward your new purchase. For example if you buy a firearm for 500 and trade in a gun valued at 400 you only pay tax on the 100 difference!

But there again for elk hunting I'm gonna want a heavy solid bullet that will retain its weight where as for squirrels I want a light weight fast projectile to blast them to smithereens.

First of all, to create reduced recoil loads you have to reload. and reloading is what allows you to afford to shoot more and reduced loads use less powder.<br /><br />I used to reload for a 30-06 Remington pump and at the same time I was reloading for a Ruger Blackhawk revolver in 30 M1 carbine chambering and at the time I was able to buy 110 grain M1 carbine projectiles for a reduced cost over any other jacketed bullet.<br /><br />I used the exact amount of the same powder that I used in the 30 carbine (alliant 2400) along with the same 110 grain 30 carbine bullet in the 30-06 and got very good results out to 100 yards but I did have to adjust my scope for a different point if aim and I wrote down the number of clicks it took to go back the the setting that I had for my 165 grain hunting load using IMR 4350 powder.<br /><br />Why in the name of all intelligent reasoning is the GOP leadership so stuck on stupid that they keep insisting that only an unprincipled, weak-kneed &quot;Moderate: can win in the General election after this strategy has proved to be a failure not just once but twice in a row???<br /><br />Theoretically the 308 with less case capacity would work better with reduced loads like this, but maybe not with fast burning pistol powders lei 2400.<br /><br />As far as a 22 bolt gun I bought a Ruger American in 223 and found out that Ruger is have pr4oblems with the magazines in these guns and I'm going to have to send it in for repair or have them send me a mag that half-ass works. The gun is well designed but the mag is not. although suppose4dly the larger .308-30-06 casehead magazines aren't having nay problems. <br /><br />As such I would strongly recommend getting either the Mossberg MVP rifle that uses the AR mags or the Savage axis that sells for the same price as the ruger but has better magazine. Ruger should have made the 223 to use AR mags. The magazine that they use look and feel cheap and flimsy yet they want $40 bucks for a spare. I'm really disappointed with Ruger with that gun I'm eoith going to try to have someone adapt it to use AR mags or else I'm going to have Ruger fix it and then I'll sell it and get a Mossberg.<br /><br />Another way to go if instead you decide to go with rimfire. would be with the Bmag Savage that just came out with a heavy barrel model and chambers the hot 17 WSM rimfire that develops 3000 fps with a 20 grain bullet. Last time I was a cabelas they had rth ammo and I've also seen it at DE Pawn on Francis. Both locfations sold the ammo for about $16-17 bucks a box as I recall. the rifle sell in the same price range as the Ruger American and savage axis. The Mossberg sells for about $150 more and that;s what I wish I would have got for a 223.","date_posted": "Mon Mar 16, 2015 11:13 am","post_id": "395921","signature": "Government is not reason, it is not eloquence \u2014 it is force.

The Axis guns don't have quite the same interchangeablity but most of the time they're cheaper. But if you can get a good price on a 110/112 series savage they are a better way to go. I have their earlier &quot;Economy Model&quot; bolt gun, a savage Stevens in 308 which is fully interchangeble with any other Savage 110.","date_posted": "Mon Mar 16, 2015 11:20 am","post_id": "395922","signature": "Government is not reason, it is not eloquence \u2014 it is force.

Contenders do not require fitting, they are generally 100% plug and play. A really anal hand loader looking for the ultimate in accuracy might fiddle with headspace by shimming the breech block for different barrels, but the vast majority of shooters need not bother. You can buy a barrel at a pawn shop and expect it to work fine. The only legal concern is that a frame originally sold as a complete rifle must not be used to make a pistol, but in reality nobody would ever know if you did....<br /><br />There are still plenty of parts for these guns, though they haven't been produced new for a few years now.<br />John Davies<br />Spokane","date_posted": "Mon Mar 16, 2015 3:00 pm","post_id": "395947","signature": "","title": "  Report this postReply with quote  <h3 >Re: Deciding on a varmint gun Thinking bolt .223","user_attributes": [{"label": "Posts:","value": "294"},{"label": "Joined:","value": "Sun Oct 03, 2010 7:41 pm"},{"label": "Location:","value": "Spokane, WA USA - The Dry Side"},{"label": "City, State:","value": "Spokane"},{"label": "Favorite Firearm:","value": "All of them"}],"user_tag": "Gun Trader","username": "John E Davies"},{"content": "<blockquote><div><cite>ron wrote:</cite>+1. with the savages you can not only swap barrels but you can swap boltfaces and change from 223 size to 308 size to belted magnum/WSM size.

First of all, to create reduced recoil loads you have to reload. and reloading is what allows you to afford to shoot more and reduced loads use less powder.<br /><br />I used to reload for a 30-06 Remington pump and at the same time I was reloading for a Ruger Blackhawk revolver in 30 M1 carbine chambering and at the time I was able to buy 110 grain M1 carbine projectiles for a reduced cost over any other jacketed bullet.<br /><br />I used the exact amount of the same powder that I used in the 30 carbine (alliant 2400) along with the same 110 grain 30 carbine bullet in the 30-06 and got very good results out to 100 yards but I did have to adjust my scope for a different point if aim and I wrote down the number of clicks it took to go back the the setting that I had for my 165 grain hunting load using IMR 4350 powder.<br /><br />Why in the name of all intelligent reasoning is the GOP leadership so stuck on stupid that they keep insisting that only an unprincipled, weak-kneed &quot;Moderate: can win in the General election after this strategy has proved to be a failure not just once but twice in a row???<br /><br />Theoretically the 308 with less case capacity would work better with reduced loads like this, but maybe not with fast burning pistol powders lei 2400.<br /><br />As far as a 22 bolt gun I bought a Ruger American in 223 and found out that Ruger is have pr4oblems with the magazines in these guns and I'm going to have to send it in for repair or have them send me a mag that half-ass works. The gun is well designed but the mag is not. although suppose4dly the larger .308-30-06 casehead magazines aren't having nay problems. <br /><br />As such I would strongly recommend getting either the Mossberg MVP rifle that uses the AR mags or the Savage axis that sells for the same price as the ruger but has better magazine. Ruger should have made the 223 to use AR mags. The magazine that they use look and feel cheap and flimsy yet they want $40 bucks for a spare. I'm really disappointed with Ruger with that gun I'm eoith going to try to have someone adapt it to use AR mags or else I'm going to have Ruger fix it and then I'll sell it and get a Mossberg.<br /><br />Another way to go if instead you decide to go with rimfire. would be with the Bmag Savage that just came out with a heavy barrel model and chambers the hot 17 WSM rimfire that develops 3000 fps with a 20 grain bullet. Last time I was a cabelas they had rth ammo and I've also seen it at DE Pawn on Francis. Both locfations sold the ammo for about $16-17 bucks a box as I recall. the rifle sell in the same price range as the Ruger American and savage axis. The Mossberg sells for about $150 more and that;s what I wish I would have got for a 223.</div></blockquote><br /><br />+1 on the Mossberg MVP choice. I have an MVP in .223/5.56 and it has proven to be extremly accurate. An added bonus in this situation would be the ability to use AR mags because while in the field hunting varmints like coyotes, squirrels etc... you have a target rich environment and AR mags would allow you to either hold more rounds and not need to reload as much or use several mags. I have found this to be very handy on my MVP and wish other manufacturers would get on board with this too","date_posted": "Tue Mar 17, 2015 5:14 pm","post_id": "396122","signature": "&quot;Don't hit at all if it is honorably possible to avoid hitting; but never hit soft.&quot;<br /> -Theodore Roosevelt</div>","title": "  Report this postReply with quote  <h3 >Re: Deciding on a varmint gun Thinking bolt .223","user_attributes": [{"label": "Posts:","value": "35"},{"label": "Joined:","value": "Wed Nov 19, 2014 11:14 am"},{"label": "City, State:","value": "Deer Park, WA"},{"label": "Favorite Firearm:","value": "The one in my hands"},{"label": "Next Firearm:","value": "who knows?"}],"user_tag": "Jr. Member","username": "NWSnipeHunter"},{"content": "So is the MVP by Mossberg the only one currently using AR mags to feed.

I have used several different types of AR mags in mine and they all function and feed very reliably and ron is correct when he says the mag-pul mags are very reliable. Another +1 for the .223 caliber is that you can either load or buy rounds with a smaller grain bullet that wont do too much damage to squirrels. There are a couple different variations of the MVP, mine is the Varmint and has the longer fluted barrel and the target style stock. The MVP Predator is a little more compact (great for swinging around in the woods) with the 18&quot; barrel and regular hunter style stock. Both take AR mags and both are very accurate. The last I saw Double Eagle on Francis had both styles for sale (used) for good prices.","date_posted": "Wed Mar 18, 2015 12:50 pm","post_id": "396221","signature": "&quot;Don't hit at all if it is honorably possible to avoid hitting; but never hit soft.&quot;<br /> -Theodore Roosevelt</div>","title": "  Report this postReply with quote  <h3 >Re: Deciding on a varmint gun Thinking bolt .223","user_attributes": [{"label": "Posts:","value": "35"},{"label": "Joined:","value": "Wed Nov 19, 2014 11:14 am"},{"label": "City, State:","value": "Deer Park, WA"},{"label": "Favorite Firearm:","value": "The one in my hands"},{"label": "Next Firearm:","value": "who knows?"}],"user_tag": "Jr. Member","username": "NWSnipeHunter"},{"content": "I have a savage .223 and it is very accurate with 50 grain vmax hand loads.

I think the expanding plug in your 300 RUM sizing die would expand the necks of 7mm brass and possibly might neck down 338 necks to 300. 375 would require some intermediate sizing dies. Years ago I played around wiith brass re-forming and used a combination of pistol dies and cut-off rifle dies to doe hat I needed to do. I use imperial sizing die wax and annealed some of the case necks by standing the brass up in a pan of water up to just below the shoulders and then hitting them with the torch until they started to change color then knocking them over into the water to quench then.<br /><br />You might consider sending the barreled action to ER Shaw and having them re-barrel to 300 win mag until the situation changes with brass availability changes. Shaw makes xlnt barrels and does good work. Even 7mm STW caliber or the 8mm rem mag brass which 7mm STW is made from might be easier to find and less expensive than RUM brass. 300 H&amp;H brass would work for that application as well. But 300 win mag brass would be the easiest to find. Othewise you could also go to 300 weatherby and you can fire form 300 H&amp;H in a weatherby chamber.","date_posted": "Sun Dec 28, 2014 1:18 pm","post_id": "385069","signature": "Government is not reason, it is not eloquence \u2014 it is force.

Rick has been my gunsmith since he started doing it full-time. He was good at it from the beginning and now he has even more experience. Scott, the guy who owns the shop is also a damn good gunsmith in his own right and a nice guy to boot. We need to give these guys all the business we can so they can afford to get a lathe and a mill and start doing some advanced custom work.<br /><br />I need to mention that the reason the shop's same is firearms finishing is because they do bluing, duracote and ceracote. Scott knows how to restore worn or rusted or dinged blued gun and not harm the original edges or lettering. He did a Belgian Browning 22 SA takedown for me and reproduced the original blued perfectly. I restored the wood, and I'm pretty good at doing that, but he's even better than I am.<br /><br />If you happen to be old-school like me and want a gun with a righteous blued finish and a figured walnut stock, he's the man to see. Or if you have and older blued Smith and wesson that isn't a rare model or variation and needs refinishing he can duplicate the original factory finish and you can have a gun that is a thing of beauty. I think he can even restore nickle plate. Or if you like cerekote, he has it in Black and a really cool shade of purple that's more of a &quot;Plum&quot; color.","date_posted": "Thu Dec 04, 2014 10:37 am","post_id": "381629","signature": "Government is not reason, it is not eloquence \u2014 it is force.

The other advantage is velocity increase. General rule of thumb is that you will gain anywhere between 25 and 50 fps per added inch of barrel length. The attached link shows that a 147 grain 9mm which develops 951 Fps out a 4 inch barrel will do 1073 fps out of a 16 inch carbine barrel and the Speer Gold do 124 grain load which does 1203 fps out of a 4 inch barrel will do 1395 fps out of a 16 inch carbine barrel which basically turns a 9mm into a 357 magnum.<br /><br />Similarly a 16 inch barrel will turn a 40 S&amp;W into a 10mm.<br /><br />My brother has a Mac 10 in 9mm and a good friend of mine has a Kel-tec sub 2000. Someone else that I know has a Hi-point, all in 9mm. I've fired all 3 on numerous occasions and like them all. The high point is a nice gun but I think that it's just plain WRONG for a semi-auto sub gun not to have a hi-cap mag. No one in the right mind would pay $1200 bucks for a semi-auto Thompson that only accepted ten round mags. Someone like Magpul needs to make hi-caps for the Hi-points. In my experience all of the hi-point guns are reliable and accurate and are inexpensive but are not &quot;Cheap&quot; or of poor quality.<br /><br />The original semi auto mac 10s were good guns but later versions had problems and are to be avoided. My brother was able to modify his to work right and also adapted it to accept 30 round steel magazines of a much better quality than the ten rounders and even some of the larger capacity mags that were made for the newer guns.<br /><br />The Kel-tecs are nice and the best thing about them is they Accept Glock factory 33 round mags or any other glock mag in 9mm and 40. My friend's Keltec has always been 100% reliable as far as feed and function and is reasonably accurate. Some were made to accept smith and Wesson or Beretta mags but I would not want one of those. My friend had his sights go out of alignment once but was able to fix it. I'm thinking that Red dot sights are the way to go on these guns.<br /><br />As far as the mechtec uppers, they work well and I've been wanting to get one for my Glock 20 which would give me 41 magnum ballistics out of a 16 inch barrel<br />but have been holding off because of the cost. the basic unit is +-$350-400 but then you need a stock and have to buy that extra and then you need sights because it only comes with a rail and so by the time you're done you've spent $5-600 or more depending on the sights plus the cost of your Glock or 1911 for the carbine.<br /><br />And then you're stuck with the problem of &quot;What gun shall I take with me today, my Glock 20 handgun, or my Glock 20 carbine?&quot; and then you start thinking of getting another Glock 20 for another $4-500 bucks or so, so that you can have both the pistol AND the carbine. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /> <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.mechtechsys.com/\">http://www.mechtechsys.com/</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.ballisticsbytheinch.com/9luger.html\">http://www.ballisticsbytheinch.com/9luger.html</a><!-- m -->","date_posted": "Thu Feb 26, 2015 10:21 am","post_id": "393119","signature": "Government is not reason, it is not eloquence \u2014 it is force.

Now if you shoot something bigger and hit heavy bone, or if you shoot cast lead, then that's a different story, but RNFMJ on small game, not so much. <br />BTW, with standard pressure ammo the little Marlin Camp 9 doesn't have much more recoil than a 22 either.

An FMJ will punch a 3/8th of an inch hole straigtht through B'rer Rabbit and a headshot will destroy no edible meat regardless. And if you learn to reload a heavy cast bullet is even better. I used to reload my 9mm Smith and Wesson model 39 with the same 158 grain bullets that I used in the 38 special using Unique powder and they cycled the action perfectly and developed about 850 fps. Out of a carbine that would be about 11-1200 fps.<br /><br />Getting high velocity out of your ammo is NOT the point of a pistol caliber carbine. It's just an added advantage depending on the ammo you use and reloading not only allows you to shoot more ammo, it gives you versatility. There main point of a pistol caliber carbine is a more stable shooting platform that affords the shooter grater practical accuracy than with a handgun particularly with optics.<br /><br />9mm brass is cheap and plentiful especially if you don't just <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">limit</span> yourself to what's available locally. It's no big deal to send away for brass or projectiles, and cast bullets are cheaper than jacketed. And if you cast your own, it's cheaper yet. I have cast bullets using an electric hot plate and a revereware stainless 3 quart sauce pan that I bought at a thrift store for well under 20 bucks but then I busted the bank and spent another $15-20 bucks on a Lyman Lead ladle that I got from white Elephant. That was a few years back and now the ones amazon sells are $ 20 bucks plus $7.49 shipping and the ones White Elephant sells are more so it's almost beter to get a Lee electric furnace from white Elephant for about 80 bucks.<br /><br />White elephant is the reloader's friend. What they don't have, they can order.<br /><br />And at action recycling on Hamilton they let me sort through their scrap lead and one time I found a big box of actual Linotype from and old printing press. Wheelweights are getting harder to find and you have to be carful that they aren't made out of ZINC because a small amount of Zinc will ruin a large amount of lead and make it un suitable for casting. As someone who's been reloading since 1968, the best advice I can give you is to tell you about the most versatile powder in existence which is Unique. some people say that unique is &quot;dirty&quot; but those are just people who tend to be fussy and somewhat anal afraid of getting their hands dirty and don't want to have to ever clean their guns after shooting them and most of all have never shot a black powder cap and ball pistol so they don't know what dirty really is.<br /><br />And what's this about the keltec sub 2000 being expensive? $355 at Impact guns for a 9mm that uses Glock mags. You add FFL and shipping and it costs more than a Hi-point but I can't think of any new handgun that you can buy for und3er $500 much less a pistol caliber carbine. And I'll tell you anoteh excellent pistol caliber carbine and that is the new RIA bolt action in 22 TCM caliber which is a pistol caliber that they chamber in one of their double stack 1911's This little rifle could do anything a 22 Hornet could do and if you were a reloader it could do anything a 22 long rifle could do or a 22 magnum rimfire as well, and they do make bullet molds suitable for this cartridge if you got into casting as well, but 40 to 50 grain 22 jacketed bullets are cheaper per 100 than larger caliber projectiles.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.impactguns.com/brand-kel-tec.aspx\">http://www.impactguns.com/brand-kel-tec.aspx</a><!-- m --><br /><br />&quot;We live in a universe of innumerable possibilities but we are severely handicapped by our own self-imposed limitations.

I have a Guns &amp; Ammo issue where they took several handgun/carbine combinations and among other details compared accuracy and velocity of the same ammo in each gun. Most carbines developed 10-25% more velocity than their handgun companions with the same ammo. The exception was the 45 ACP. In the Marlin Camp Carbine several loads actually lost a small amount of velocity (10-50 fps), and of the ones that gained some, the increase was about the same.<br />The benefit, as Ron pointed out, is the increased ability to put rounds on target, especially as the range begins to open out. This is the same rationale that led to the development and issuance of the M-1 carbine. It was recognized that the little 30 cal round likely would not be a great stopping round as compared to the 45 ACP, but rounds that hit are the only ones that count and the loss was deemed acceptable if it meant more rounds on target. <br /> Interestingly, the M-1 Carbine had two distinct reputations, depending on where it was employed. In the Pacific theater it was deemed to have lack luster performance against a determined adversary, however in the European theater it was accepted enthusiastically and had no such reputation. Consider that the Japanese were of smaller stature than the average German, and that in Europe there were brutal winters to deal with which meant most combatants would be wearing thick clothing. On their face these factors should seem to make the reputations very contradictory, but in the end it seems the most important thing was how determined your attacker was to get you that decided how hard he was to stop.","date_posted": "Fri Feb 27, 2015 10:03 pm","post_id": "393357","signature": "Profanity is the crutch of the illiterate mind.

I don't like how it's worded either but I really can't imagine a worse case scenario where I could get hurt and they could sue ME. If I hurt someone else that's another story but it would be the same situation if I were out on public land shooting or hunting and I hurt someone else, I would be liable. <br /><br />Also I joined the SRC for a year and then gave it up and prefer to shoot out in the wide open spaces to any range but that's another situation where if you aren't pro-active and involved in making sure those places don't get messed up and shut down that there are going to be fewer of those kinds of places available. Which reminds me, we need to start thinking about schedueling another group range clean-up with spring weather coming. <br /><br />I firmly believe in taking action rather than just complaining. But that's not to say I don't mind complaining and woint yell the loudest when there's nothing I can do when something sucks.

,{"posts": [{"content": "Almost all AR15's I've seen are chambered in 5.56 which lets you shoot 5.56 and .223.<br /><br />As for barrel, if you ever plan on shooting 69+grain bullets try and get a 1/7 or 1/8 twist. A lot of the entry level AR's have a 1/9 twist which is good for most of the ammo people shoot in the 55-62grain variety but might not stabilize the heavier bullets. <br /><br />There are several places online where you can get 5.56 or .223 ammo for less then $300 shipped per 1000rnds. The Armory is one of the best and look at the Wolf Gold .223.<br /><br />Nice thing about the AR15 is you can get uppers in various calibers but reuse the same lower assembly if you want cutting costs down greatly.
