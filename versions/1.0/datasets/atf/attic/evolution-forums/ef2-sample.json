If you leave a feedback, they can see what you bought and who you are.</p><p>Instating a public buyer record system could be a good idea in some ways - the buyers can see the best selling items and help them decide which one to go for, and you can determine if the seller is active by looking at the time of his last successful transaction. But also, as a service provider myself, I am very serious about protecting my client&#039;s privacy. By default, I assume they don&#039;t wish to be known to be using my services. Some customers appreciate this, while others don&#039;t really mind. But it&#039;s always better safe than sorry.</p><p>My suggestion: Only shows a total sales of a listing and offer the buyers an option to buy anonymously. If the buyer picks the option at checkout, only the seller would know their identity. Their feedbacks would be anonymous. If not, then everything would just show as normal.</p><p>fnu</p>",

I think your doing a great job running things so far,just an idea you may consider is running a similar system to Outlaw market <br />They have a 30 day renewable charge to list things ,this would keep the scummy scammers away and not to much $ for new vendors to afford as you have to keep your float there to reload, 0.5 btc is a big dent in us smaller vendors, plus in some cases having to wait 14 days for auto finalize as i&#039;m waiting for now,this can make things difficult .Maybe bringing the auto fe down to 7 days, this is surely&#160; a long enough delivery period for anywhere in the world.<br />Thanks p12</p>",

Even if the site is compromised, evo run off with the money (unlikely!) or whatever happens you&#039;ve paid 0.5 to sell whatever you want! Compare that to the sort of fees and commissions in any other business and it is still low.</p><p>As for the comments about setting it in dollars. Two points.</p><p>1. We are supposed to be promoting bitcoin and since it&#039;s the only currency in use here why show it any other way?</p><p>2. US Dollars are not the only currency! Believe it or not others exist outside of the USA, Perhaps evo should set the deposit in every known currency? Except that would take forever and some of those are no more stable! I am including the dollar, gb pound and the Euro in that. The difference is their value changes without you even knowing, the money in your pocket can simply be devalued by the government that is in control of your currency.</p><p>Just keep things the way they are. The comment about making a limit of a month for vendors to withdraw can only have been made by buyers. 14 days is long enough, otherwise you are doing an ebay and pushing out the little guy who needs to pay bills and allowing the bigger &quot;businesses&quot; to monopolize.</p><p>Rant over.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I think reviewss should usually come after success ( in this case, coins hitting wallet ). It&#039;s simply too easy to be wooed by potential positives. Unfortunately with any guide or method you should be in the habit of finding flaw, or incorrect information. Once this has been completed you should move on to a full beginning to end trial, and expect positive ( and completed ) results. Multiple trials is obviously best to show a win/lose ratio if necessary.</p><p>Vouching for a method you have not actually completed ( despite where the fault lies - which is no excuse ) is very unpro. Let&#039;s skip the buddy buddy stuff guys, and stick to brass tacks, please.</p><p>These are just a very few basic things that should be undertaken for reviews, and even moreso vouches.

And yes, new vendors could has great services and we can&#039;t judge them for their registration dates or posts.</p><p>Thanks for your wishes.

I&#039;m glad to business with you.</p><p>Bigmeesh was my first customer for this method and also i think he was the first person who tried my method except me. So, i have earn some new experiences while we talking with Bigmeesh for this process. Today i will make some additions/edits on my guide for making it more easy. And we&#039;ll ready to go for monday.</p><p>First of all, i must to repeat, my source website&#039;s owners really amateur with bitcoin work and webmastering. It provides lots of advantages for us.<br />If they were a huge company or professional people, as you can guess, they would not be selling bitcoins for CC without any verification process <img src=\"http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/img/smilies/smile.png\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"smile\" /><br />IMHO, they only want to spread their service for more people. That&#039;s why they have amazing support and very helpful. Their commission rate is good. Even so, good for compared to bigger sites like btc-e or some greedy exchange sites.</p><p>As i said before, </p><p>- My source is extremely easy to card.</p><p>- The only thing you have to do is </p><p>* Create a fake e-mail <br />* find a good balanced CC, <br />* use right socks, timezone<br />* make your payment and <br />* fill a simple form. (i will asist how to fill it)</p><p>That&#039;s all.</p><p>- After that, i will asist you rest of the process. They will e-mail to you something for verify your payment in another language. You will copy-paste that e-mail and i will write an answer instead of you. </p><p>- You will copy-paste my email and sent them on working days (oh they&#039;re working even on sunday <img src=\"http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/img/smilies/big_smile.png\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"big_smile\" />) and they will sent your bitcoin directly to your wallet.</p><p>i think it&#039;s very easy for everyone. Your only responsibility is to find a CC and make a simple payment. I only can&#039;t support about this. There are tons of sources in deep-web and evolution market for finding good CC&#039;s. Most cards could work with this. Because their security is weak.</p><p>Also, our strategy is simple too. For the first purchase, we will not exceed $70-80. After than, if your card is good and have some balance, you can try higher amounts. </p><p>And the goal is, you can repeat each step with another names and cards. You can make huge profit before this saturated. If a have a good ID scans for that area, i can try huge amounts per card. Oh meanwhile, i really miss ISP.</p><p>Now, business time friends. You must hurry up. First come first serve! Soon i am starting to make some small changes and additions on my guide. And it will be ready and more easy for this week! My sale quota is limited for avoiding quick saturation!</p><p>After you placed your order, we can talk about our timing for order and other steps. This is because i want to help for taking your coins on to your wallet quickly within same day.</p><p>Best regards, <br />yummy.</p>",

When the chargeback rates more than usual orders, they probably add new security measures. But i can pass their some security measures <img src=\"http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/img/smilies/smile.png\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"smile\" /> i regularly check the source, do not worry.</p><p>That&#039;s why my sale quantity is limited. Now, this is still working like a charm. And please focus that, my support is more important than my *guide for this method. </p><p>Communicate with site owners, choose the right/common words while e-mailing is important. i still giving full support to my customers.</p><p>Moka thank you again friend. Glad to see your comment.</p><p>i can give support to my customers about,</p><p>- phone number format for that site<br />- addresses<br />- name surname info<br />- zip code <br />etc.</p><p>Even, i will look for some burner sim cards for them. if i success, you can purchase for more amounts and i can call them instead of you. The only problem is, i talked with them a few times and i&#039;m in suspicious about my voice. Help me moka <img src=\"http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/img/smilies/tongue.png\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"tongue\" /> any software or way for voice change is apcepted.</p><p>So, that&#039;s all.</p><p>As you see, i do everything for making this easy method &gt; more easy for you.

Unfortunately with any guide or method you should be in the habit of finding flaw, or incorrect information.

Multiple trials is obviously best to show a win/lose ratio if necessary.</p><p>Vouching for a method you have not actually completed ( despite where the fault lies - which is no excuse ) is very unpro.

You&#039;re right. But even so, a combination of post count, post content and feedbacks gives a bit idea to people for that vendor. And yes, new vendors could has great services and we can&#039;t judge them for their registration dates or posts.</p><p>Thanks for your wishes. Oh, writing about polemics is really boring for me because of my english.<br />------------------<br />i just want to answer your focused points. <br />Have a nice day.</p> <p class=\"postedit\"><em>Last edited by yummy5656 (2014-05-17 00:46:18)</em></p>",

        "content": "<p>Great to see your nice comment and kindly words Bigmeesh. I&#039;m glad to business with you.</p><p>Bigmeesh was my first customer for this method and also i think he was the first person who tried my method except me. So, i have earn some new experiences while we talking with Bigmeesh for this process. Today i will make some additions/edits on my guide for making it more easy. And we&#039;ll ready to go for monday.</p><p>First of all, i must to repeat, my source website&#039;s owners really amateur with bitcoin work and webmastering. It provides lots of advantages for us.<br />If they were a huge company or professional people, as you can guess, they would not be selling bitcoins for CC without any verification process <img src=\"http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/img/smilies/smile.png\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"smile\" /><br />IMHO, they only want to spread their service for more people. That&#039;s why they have amazing support and very helpful. Their commission rate is good. Even so, good for compared to bigger sites like btc-e or some greedy exchange sites.</p><p>As i said before, </p><p>- My source is extremely easy to card.</p><p>- The only thing you have to do is </p><p>* Create a fake e-mail <br />* find a good balanced CC, <br />* use right socks, timezone<br />* make your payment and <br />* fill a simple form. (i will asist how to fill it)</p><p>That&#039;s all.</p><p>- After that, i will asist you rest of the process. They will e-mail to you something for verify your payment in another language. You will copy-paste that e-mail and i will write an answer instead of you. </p><p>- You will copy-paste my email and sent them on working days (oh they&#039;re working even on sunday <img src=\"http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/img/smilies/big_smile.png\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"big_smile\" />) and they will sent your bitcoin directly to your wallet.</p><p>i think it&#039;s very easy for everyone. Your only responsibility is to find a CC and make a simple payment. I only can&#039;t support about this. There are tons of sources in deep-web and evolution market for finding good CC&#039;s. Most cards could work with this. Because their security is weak.</p><p>Also, our strategy is simple too. For the first purchase, we will not exceed $70-80. After than, if your card is good and have some balance, you can try higher amounts. </p><p>And the goal is, you can repeat each step with another names and cards. You can make huge profit before this saturated. If a have a good ID scans for that area, i can try huge amounts per card. Oh meanwhile, i really miss ISP.</p><p>Now, business time friends. You must hurry up. First come first serve! Soon i am starting to make some small changes and additions on my guide. And it will be ready and more easy for this week! My sale quota is limited for avoiding quick saturation!</p><p>After you placed your order, we can talk about our timing for order and other steps. This is because i want to help for taking your coins on to your wallet quickly within same day.</p><p>Best regards, <br />yummy.</p>",

When the chargeback rates more than usual orders, they probably add new security measures.

Now, this is still working like a charm. And please focus that, my support is more important than my *guide for this method. </p><p>Communicate with site owners, choose the right/common words while e-mailing is important. i still giving full support to my customers.</p><p>Moka thank you again friend. Glad to see your comment.</p><p>i can give support to my customers about,</p><p>- phone number format for that site<br />- addresses<br />- name surname info<br />- zip code <br />etc.</p><p>Even, i will look for some burner sim cards for them. if i success, you can purchase for more amounts and i can call them instead of you.

        "content": "<p>i think you guys trying CC&#039;s too much and so aggressive <img src=\"http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/img/smilies/tongue.png\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"tongue\" /></p><p>Payeer is not additional security measure. it&#039;s only a payment gateway for purchasing your orders. This may brings to us some advantages and disadvantages. First of all, payeer accept many of payments methods for depositing an account which including <br />- Directly Visa / Mastercard payments<br />- Western Union<br />- Wire transfers<br />- Liqpay<br />- Checks</p><p>etc.&#160; Go there for a quick checkout &gt; https://payeer.com/en/add/</p><p>And there are lots of website which allows to exchange/convert your other funds to one of them. For example we can find an exchange site for converting paypal to X OR we can adding to money to our Western Union account if we can have a FULLZ with right BINS. Now, possibilities are more for payments. And i think you have no limitation with some special COUNTRIES/areas for payments. But now, our CON is these payeers guys are not amateur people like my source site&#039;s guys and they may ask for some other documents for verify payments. Especially , payments which made via DIRECTLY VISA/MASTERCARD. Notice please, you still can made your payments via other ways that payeer accepted!</p><p>In the other hand, my source guys still unaware of the security. They still don&#039;t ask for any registration process or documents. Their only wish is, customers made payments and communicate with them and they will send BTC&#039;s. Even so, if they ask for phone call, i&#039;m working hard to find burner sim cards and making phone calls instead of you. This is not hard for me. Even, i can do this at this moment too. But i must find more sim cards for next week.</p><p>i e-mailed them and they say, </p><p>&quot;we are still trying to find best payment system for purchases and avoiding TAXES for both, you and us&quot;</p><p>So, i&#039;m sure that they will change again this on next week or later. They still think, &quot;only problem is tax rates&quot; They don&#039;t wonder about fake purchases or their security. <br />In this time, i will make a research about passing payeer system easily and notify you again. i think, WU/w fullz should be the best solution for us. Or some fake checks or wire transfers and bank accounts. can&#039;t guess now, i need a few days for checking this. Also i&#039;ll make trying with my cards ans some ID&#039;s for payeer.<br />---------------<br />TL:DR<br />Now,<br />- We still have a source and their owners still don&#039;t care about security and don&#039;t ask for registration/ scanned documents / phone calls before purchasing bitcoin/litecoin. They still make tryings with their new site and change their interface / groundwork. So, even at this moment while i writing this post they may change their system again.</p><p>- The only thing we have to do is make our payments via payeer for NOW.<br />- Payeer has lots of ways for depositing funds and we must find the easiest way for this.<br />- After the orders placed, i can made phone calls or provide some additional documents for wining trust with my site (for huge orders). So, you still only responsible for making payments. Rest of the progress is mine work.<br />- Now, you have no limitation for finding CC&#039;s from special locations or acting like a people from special area. Payeer is global shit. i can asist you how to talk and communicate with my guys if you use a name for payment from worldwide!</p><p>Will updated on next week when i complete my tryings and workings and conversating with the source site owners. <br />Regards.</p> <p class=\"postedit\"><em>Last edited by yummy5656 (2014-05-22 06:29:41)</em></p>",

        "content": "<p>I&#039;m taking PM&#039;s with same question, and here&#039;s some answers to all Evoluters.</p><p>- Yes, my source is still alive and working.<br />- From begining i&#039;ve posted this in here, they never saturated. Just changed their payment options from another one to another. It&#039;s good for all of us. They&#039;re still insistent for selling BTC with several types of payments.<br />-------------------<br />For example, in last week they&#039;ve added directly <strong>PAYPAL</strong> payments to their paypal account and i can hit up $850. But NOW, i see that, they remove directly paypal option.</p><p>It may because of my old customers / or others WRONG tryings with weak middleman paypal accounts (because of disputes) or PAYPAL&#039;s policy about bitcoin selling.<br />As you know paypal don&#039;t allow any kind of crypto money selling like BTC/LTC etc.<br />--------------------</p><p>Overall, i must honestly share some of my experiences as PROS/CONS about this.</p><p>PROS &gt;</p><p>[+] It seems they will never saturate. They&#039;re still selling BTC nevertheless lots of fraud attempt and chargeback.<br />[+] My source is really quick for sending your BTC. They usually sent it <strong>30 minutes- 2 hours</strong> delay on working days/hours.<br />[+] Their communication is still great and very fast. When you e-mail them something in their language they quickly replied on working hours. I think they&#039;re more safe than fucking Virwox. They never scam your money with excuses like &quot;suspect of fraud&quot; or they never banned you from sales without any excuse.<br />[+] I&#039;ve talked them with phone several times with my burners. So i&#039;ve good SE skills with them. And i can help all of my customers if they need SE. This is so important for making easy your job!</p><p>CONS &gt;</p><p>[+] They change their payment types after some fraud attempts and it may be bad for some of my customers. For example about 1 months ago, they decide to sell BTC with AMAZON GIFT CARDS and remove it after 2 weeks. 2 of my old customers could pick-up some money with AGC&#039;s and then they suprised for this. For example, i can hit up easy $850 within 3 days with PAYPAL and now, i&#039;m sad because of paypal removed <img src=\"http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/img/smilies/smile.png\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"smile\" /> But i can&#039;t guess anything. Maybe they again will add directly paypal option to their another paypal account. I can&#039;t say anything at this moment.</p><p>[+] Website owner&#039;s language is not ENGLISH. But just NOTIFY, i can give fully support for communicate with them if you need SE or talking or translating website&#039;s phrases.</p><p>[+] They&#039;re amateur on webmastering and while they changing their website&#039;s interface/payment options, they may offline about 3-4 hours for maintenance. It&#039;s not a really con it&#039;s usual thing but i must to say this anyway.</p><p>------------------------------</p><p>Overall, i earned about $6k on 2 months and still going on. It&#039;s a long-life source as i said before.</p><p>Now, they&#039;re accepting </p><p>* CC payments (via an international 3rd party website)<br />* Moneygram<br />* PerfectMoney<br />* Cashu<br />* Webmoney<br />* Okpay<br />* Egopay<br />* LTC<br />--------------<br />CC payment source familiar for me and they also accept paypal (you need fake ID&#039;s)<br />--------------</p><p>You can deposit and pay for BTC, whatever you want. <br />You can use it for fraud or converting your virtual moneys.<br />----------------</p><p><strong>Because of &quot;directly paypal&quot; option removed at this moment, price again dropped to 0.4 btc /QUOTA &gt; 2 and sales going on.</strong></p><p><strong>You can ask questions via PM on Evo market. I&#039;ll give good support and step-by-step instructions to my all customers as always.</strong></p><div class=\"codebox\"><pre><code>http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/17876</code></pre>",

I&#039;m sure there is alot people who have hacked paypal accounts with money and who can&#039;t make real money from it. So there is your chance to get real money from it. Why i&#039;m not doing that ? I was doing it , but im not into that shit anymore , now i&#039;m dealing with real life stuff , physical carding , counterfeits , documents etc. I was buying paypals from susp3kt and turning them into BTC so you can do same or if you have Paypals (must be verified) you can cash it all out to your BTC wallet.</p>",

I&#039;ve uploaded a scan of it here. (http://tinypic.com/r/20iikg/8) - I hidden the address of the post office for my confidentiality.</p><p>I also don&#039;t understand the point the buyer made about the &#039;REF number&#039; of the parcel. If there is was a problem with the tracking status of the item, that is a fault with the Courier&#039;s tracking and is beyond my control. I fail to see how this is even a valid point as the buyer claims to have recieved the parcel anyway, even though he&#039;s lying about whats inside.</p><p>In addition to this, i&#039;d like to make a few points to support my case against this scammer. Firstly, this buyer has disputed his last few purchases too, which shows me that he has got friendly with the refund process on evolution. However I refuse to let the buyer get away with getting 3 free Macbook&#039;s purely because of his lies. I have had vast interest in this listing and have had to put many buyers on hold as i&#039;m currently awaiting more stock.</p><p>I&#039;d greatly appreciate immediate assistance from the Evolution admin to resolve this issue, as I don&#039;t appreciate being scammed out of goods which have taken me a lot of hard work to aqcuire. Please let me know if you need any further evidence as i&#039;d be more than happy to provide you with any further pieces of evidence you may require.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Tramadol.<br />me<br />May 15, 2014 08:32 UTC<br />Look mate, please honestly please i am begging you do not do this to me.....I have done nothing wrong I have a good history with my passed buyers dont try and make me look like i am the one who scammed you. I am stupid to even buy from you when you had no feedback or previous sells...have a heart man.

I just want my btc PLEASE Tramadol....I dont know what else to say</p><p>I await your response admin.<br />Thank You<br />tramadol<br />May 15, 2014 11:12 UTC<br />I&#039;m astounded by the fact one person can lie so much! Your points do not back up anything you say! The only reason it took 5 days to arrive was because the parcel was in the delivery office over the weekend as it was posted on the 10th (which was a saturday).</p><p>Secondly, the previous messages you keep posting only support the fact that I had claimed to support full escrow and that I answered your every question! You are the one that needs to have a heart! You also wrote &#039;the reference number proves the box he sent was delivered a few minutes before i wrote my dispute&#039;. What point are you even trying to make?... That you recieved my macbooks and replaced them with water in an attempt to get a full refund? ALL of your points have no evidence WHAT SO EVER, you are just full of lies!! Please just stop this, I don&#039;t understand why you can&#039;t be happy with such a bargain purchase. People like you make me sick.</p><p>I&#039;m done with this buyers very persuasive lies and sure hope that the Evolution Admin don&#039;t fall for your nonsense! You should be banned from here.</p><p>I would appreciate admins immediate assistance.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>tramadol.<br />tramadol<br />May 15, 2014 11:16 UTC<br />P.S - I&#039;ve just realised a solid point that I forgot earlier which has caught you out! Tell me this... How can a &#039;4pack case of water and a nike shoe box&#039; weigh 7.190kg? I can&#039;t believe I didn&#039;t realise that earlier. Even the weight of my parcel matches to the equivalent of 3 Macbooks. I hope admin realises you are nothing but a greedy liar.</p><p>Thanks<br />me<br />May 15, 2014 12:13 UTC<br />Listen just stop all this man!!!! im not here for a game. You know what you did so i am just here to talk to admin. all your points are so proffessional which shows you have had all this planned....so let me tell admin why you are lieing</p><p>1) you clearly say</p><p>tramadol<br />May 04, 2014 12:30 UTC<br />got 3 left all sealed bought carded from amazon.</p><p>Will have to package and ship seperately.</p><p>What is your shipping location?</p><p>*So if you package and shipped them seperatly then why are you talking about weight?? anyone can find the weight of one mac and add it up.</p><p>2) You did not even give me a tracking number untill i asked what was up with my order...</p><p>3) There is no proof that whatever details of whatever package you sent to wherever you sent it was sent to my address..(you say for your own privacy, but it is clear why)</p><p>4) You have never even had any activity on this site either as a vendor or buyer</p><p>5) You say you didnt realised a solid point about the weight?... you purposely kept that for your come back as you clearly stated in your first reply that **I full proof that I sent the goods with a reciept displaying the weight and tracking number of the parcel**</p><p>You have fucked me over, but i swear i will die before yu try and do me like this...whats your problem? just call it quits you havent even lost anything this is wrong man.#</p><p>ADMIN please please see through this bullshit..You guys are big names in this market and I know you have delt with all sorts of rippers....</p><p>P.S..I will personally contact royal mail and find out if I can get anymore info to prove what has happend to me.<br />me<br />May 15, 2014 12:30 UTC<br />just to add...i have done my research 1 of the same macbooks weighs 2.1kg (x3) = 6.3........7.190 - 6.3 = 0.89kg<br />Now tell me what cardboard box weighs the remaining 0.89kg??? im not saying its impossible but didnt you say you would have to post and pack them seperately??</p><p>You wanna play hard, lets play hard....im ready.</p><p>Im still doing more finding out so feel free to come up with more lies while im on the phone to royal mail.<br />me<br />May 15, 2014 12:33 UTC<br />oh yh also...if you have already carded them from amazon before you even posted your listing.....then why would you need to hide the address of the post office? after you had carded them and recieved them you could no long be linked to the crime if im wrong? all it would be is a normal guy sending gifts if im not wrong?? but anyway ill be back....thats just something for you to think about.<br />me<br />May 15, 2014 12:48 UTC<br />i have just come off the phone......so number one....Royal mail dont have the weight as it was sent through parcel force via royal mail (nice move mate)</p><p>But royal did confirm that it was sent from a post office in &#039;beech hill&#039; then to &#039;bristol north&#039; then to &#039;london south west depot&#039;<br />then to my address</p><p>anyway the kind lady on the phone gave me parcel force number as they will have proof of the weight so if you wanna call them before I do heres the number mate 08448004466 lol</p><p>You fucked with the wrong guy i swear.....I will personally go to beech hill post office and start my search for you from there, I will hunt you down mate.....you watch Ive only just started.....You are NOT getting away with this.</p><p>Admin ill be back.<br />Thanks</p><p>me<br />May 15, 2014 12:54 UTC<br />also you keep talking about royal mail.....but even on the fucking box there is a parcel force sticker hahahahah what da fuck bro you are so shit.... i have pics of the label<br />me<br />May 15, 2014 13:01 UTC<br />looooooooooool the fucking tracking number is even on the sticker.....ill upload it<br />and i thought i was a noob for get ripped like a stupid fucker hahahahahahaha thanks mate you taught me a vauluable lesson.....I will get MORE proof if you need admin as PARCEL FORCE (not royal mail) are being very helpful on the phone right now....I will even get them to send me a copy of any corresspondence if need be..</p><p>Tramadol......Are you still there?? You&#039;ve gone quite? why is that?</p><p>Thanks soon be back when i figure out how to upload pics lol<br />me<br />May 15, 2014 13:20 UTC<br />I was told they are going to give me the full details including route of the parcel......also they said I should always be carefull as they are aware that fraud has been ongoing via there company due to a flaw or loophole.....I dont know what that means....but I will update the pic of the label tonight and ill be back tommorrow with more info from parcel force if Tramadol still wants to take me on......</p><p>Thanks Admin</p><p>Also I will go and report this fraud to police.....i will pretend I ordered something legitly and I will give them the info about the post office in beech hill....when They see the time it was sent I will get video evidence of your dirty face. I dont like police or the law...which is why im here but If you want to play dirty, I can be soooooo fucking dirty.</p><p>And if the police dont wanna help......Nobody will be able to help you, because i will devote my life to getting you back.<br />tramadol<br />May 15, 2014 15:22 UTC<br />Firstly, I don&#039;t take kindly to threats, especially from a fraudster like you! I simply can not believe the lenghts this person has gone through to get a refund. You can report anything to the police and you can happily visit that post office as many times as you like if that makes you happy. Its not going to change the fact that you are a dirty fraudster who is trying to get 3 Mackbooks for free.</p><p>Let me reply to your points. Firstly, ParcelForce is part of the Royal Mail company you idiot. ALL large parcels are handled though them. Thats common knowledge. I gave you a tracking number when I logged on to Evolution. So don&#039;t make out that that I was reluctant to give it! And I hid the address of the post office for my annonymity! I don&#039;t want people/police to know my local post office and trace carded macbooks back to me!</p><p>Thirdly, YOUR POST CODE is clearly on the reciept! So how would I have sent it elsewhere?</p><p>In addition to this, why dont you weigh the box and upload the weight? The large box weighed just under a Kilo.</p><p>You are a very good liar, I give it to you, but can you please just admit that you recieved the Macbooks so its easier for everyone. If you wan&#039;t to contact the police, GO AHEAD. When they find your macbooks, you&#039;ll be in more trouble for buying stolen goods.</p><p>I URGE YOU TO STOP LYING AND ADMIT YOU&#039;RE FRAUDSTER.</p><p>EVERY POINT YOU HAVE MADE IS INVALID AND I&#039;VE REPLIED TO EVERY SINGLE ONE.</p><p>Please admin can you just release the funds now as it&#039;s more than evident, in my opinion, that this buyer is nothing but a good liar and a fraudster! Thank you.</p><p>tramadol<br />May 15, 2014 15:34 UTC<br />Who has gone silent now??<br />me<br />May 15, 2014 16:17 UTC<br />hahahahahahahaha i love your sprit if anything but as i said I will die before you get my money......</p><p>Look lets just end this now......</p><p>I have it all now admin, here it goes...</p><p>So parcel force have informed me that the loophole is this,</p><p>-anyone can go online and book a collect on the website<br />-then they can print all info plus label<br />-then they take any box to the post office and just stick the label<br />-then if any collection is gone the next driver just takes it hence the reason why he can say the post office weighed it.</p><p>but anyway that is what he did.... but heres the icing on the cake.<br />Parcel force have confirmed that the parcel was put in at 15;38 monday 12th may 2014 and the last collection on that day was at 15;40...? 2mins interval....they also confirmed that it was sent via 48hr service...but didnt you it was &#039;posted&#039; on the 10th??....further to my inquires I spoke to Adrian Lee who is head in the beechhill post office.....</p><p>i called him on 0117-965-4846...and he told me that alot of people can do the same thing you did if the label are already on...he said all they have to do is miss one days collection time and then it would be put with the next collection and therefore it would be overlooked.....he said there where boxes left over from saturday 10th the day you say it was posted??? (im even helping you sound true).....</p><p>**you said....The only reason it took 5 days to arrive was because the parcel was in the delivery office over the weekend as it was posted on the 10th (which was a saturday).**</p><p>looool but i have clean proof that you sent it via 48hr service....<br />so even if it was posted on saturday as you say...then it would have been here by monday...tuesday at the most mate.<br />And dont try and change your words, because you sounded so confident saying it was POSTED on saturday 10thbecause you know what you have done...</p><p>And its so funny how your so formal in your messages about all of this...I am fucking irrated right now...keep calling me stupid names to impress the Admin...but like i said i will devote my life to this, becuase just your cheekiness alone is enough for you to die....any other person would have given in when they know they have been got, but you wanna take a this to the end of the world...</p><p>THE TRUTH WILL ALWAYS PROVAIL</p><p>And if you think what i said was a treat then you dont know whats coming.... I have alredy booked a ticket for bristol....should i upload that for proof????<br />tramadol<br />May 15, 2014 16:25 UTC<br />First off, the whole argument you have just put forward is invalid. The post office put the sticker on for me. I didn&#039;t pre-purchase the postage stamp. To prove this, why don&#039;t you send a picture of the postage label on the box? With pre-paid postage, you have to print off the label and stick it to the box, which I didn&#039;t as I paid in the post office. So thats your whole argument proven wrong... yet again.</p><p>And I did post the parcel on the Saturday using their 48Hour service. However this is not guaranteed. It states on the royal mail website it can take longer than this, and most of the time this is actually the case!</p><p>Even so, how does the time the item took to arrive indicate in any way that I scammed you? Your arguments are nothing but false and meaningless, and when you revealed for the true scam artist that you are, I hope you learn a lesson.</p><p>And once again, don&#039;t attempt to threaten me on here. I hope the admin see you for who you really are.</p><p>p.s - enjoy your trip to bristol <img src=\"http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/img/smilies/smile.png\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"smile\" /><br />tramadol<br />May 15, 2014 16:34 UTC<br />Also, the reciept CLEARLY states I posted the parcel on the 10th. Royal Mail may have processed it at a later date, but thats in the their hands, not mine so that was beyond my control. It&#039;s unclear to me why you are still disputing this issue as you have provided NO evidence what so ever, neither have you made any valid points.</p><p>All of my evidence indicates to the fact I sent you 3 Macbook Pro&#039;s, and yours does too so why not just admit that you were lying and be happy with a good deal!</p><p>tramadol<br />May 16, 2014 10:43 UTC<br />I take it &#039;Jacob&#039; has realised the error of his ways as he has not replied in a while. Admin, can you please cast your desicion?</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Tramadol.<br />me<br />May 16, 2014 14:48 UTC<br />looooool.....listen mate i havent gone anywhere so stop crying to admin...</p><p>heres the pics admin, i used your site by the way tramadol.</p><p>[img]http://i57.tinypic.com/2vds09i.jpg[/img]</p><p>[img]http://i62.tinypic.com/whhl4.jpg[/img]</p><p>[img]http://i57.tinypic.com/x2jevq.jpg[/img]</p><p>Admin please make your desicion asap...its clean and clear i have been scammed...<br />tramadol<br />May 16, 2014 15:10 UTC<br />Hi,</p><p>Thanks for uploading pictures that have no value what so ever. You have in fact proven some of my earlier points. Firstly, you have proven that the parcel was paid for in the post office and not a pre-printed postage label, as you can see...However, as i&#039;ve stated earlier, this isn&#039;t even a valid point as you have recieved the parcel.</p><p>Secondly, how on earth can the contents of the box in picture 3 you sent weigh 7.190kg?? Looks like you&#039;ve just been caught out over your own lies!</p><p>I&#039;d like to thank you for uploading these photos as you&#039;ve pretty much proven I&#039;m telling the truth and you&#039;re nothing but a fraudster.</p><p>Admin, please make your decision now, as I can see more than enough evidence to make a desicion against this liar.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>tramadol.<br />Moderator Bigmeesh<br />May 16, 2014 16:31 UTC<br />Buyer post the tracking numbers and submit a screenshot with the parcel and the tracking number on it.<br />tramadol<br />May 16, 2014 16:43 UTC<br />Hi bigmeesh, thanks for replying. Just thought i&#039;d show you that the picture of the reciept I uploaded (http://tinypic.com/r/20iikg/8) has the same tracking number as displayed on the parcel sticker that Jacob uploaded (http://i62.tinypic.com/whhl4.jpg). You can make out the number which is displayed under the barcode on Jacob&#039;s image.<br />Moderator Bigmeesh<br />May 16, 2014 16:56 UTC<br />Honestly, to me it looks like this dispute needs to be split equally, as I can not make a clear ascertain decision.

Let me answer all of your invalid pathetic points once again!</p><p>Firstly, I didn&#039;t know Verto and Kimble existed till bigmeech informed me yesterday... So that just extends the point that your scamming self planned this all along! Secondly, you know full well that the 3 Macbooks fitted in that box! Plus, the Macbook retina box isn&#039;t big at all unlike the previous model.</p><p>And I shipped them together to save shipping costs! Isn&#039;t that just obvious??</p><p>Jacob I urge you to give up on your scamming, please. Can just accept a good deal? What is wrong with you. Its evident that the picture of the water and shoebox doesn&#039;t weigh 7.190kg! You caught yourself out, yet you are still persistent in lying! You are one evil person sir.</p><p>And thank you admin for your assistance so far.</p><p>Regards, tramadol.<br />tramadol<br />May 17, 2014 12:34 UTC<br />Hi</p><p>Just letting the admin know that I won&#039;t be available till tomorrow now.</p><p>I believe I have provided more than enough evidence and I trust the admin to make the right decision.</p><p>Regards, tramadol.<br />me<br />May 18, 2014 12:44 UTC<br />Hello,</p><p>Please can you just shut up tramadol....you have had your chance to back yourself its over now...all you are doing is using what i used against you against me.....??? does that even make sence?

If he hit her just go and fuck his shit up. knock on his door say it a delivery, he opens and make his face hold the bat.</p><p>There no way a guy could hit my girl and im going to come on a forum to weigh out the options. if you don&#039;t want to confront him. get a rat or similar on his computer fuck with him mentally<br />start talking to him while he watches his porn, record it through his cam and put it online.<br />and im sorry dude, its disrespectful, but the guy who said she prob sucked his dick and he mad at her for not leaving you........</p><p>That shit was funny man you got to admit</p>",

Second, once he realizes he is being fucked with he&#039;ll start going through the possible names, and even if it is years later, will eventually come around to your name. Third, rather than wear them down, they&#039;ll get pissed off, angry and defiant. If someone thinks it is just bad luck/their own fuckups screwing them over, they get depressed.

For example depending on the country unless they find the merchandise at your place or can prove that a computer/device/account in your possession was used in the carding process then you have what they call &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot;; especially if you don&#039;t have any prior convictions.&#160; If your local DA is a hard ass they could decide to fuck with you by charging you and putting you through the paces hoping that maybe you will crack and strike a deal. It a favorite tactic by LE, knowing that most people are terrified of prison and will just break down after a enough pressure is applied.</p><p>With all that being said I still wouldn&#039;t recommend you put yourself in that predicament but if you find your self sitting in an unbearably cold interrogation room just remember to DENY DENY DENY.&#160; If they could lock you up for receiving a fraudulent package without proof you were involed then everyone who&#039;s residence was used as a drop would be sitting in prison....

The courier could be compelled to play along. Even if you refuse them though, if any complaints are filed, you would now be on the LEOs radar and they could remember your name if comes up again in 6 months to a year later. Oh ya, also completely wipe your harddrives by doing something like DBAN wipes or a dd copy of /dev/urandom in case your computer is ever seized. Then possibly consider a new career. I&#039;d suggest pumping gas, but I&#039;m concerned about your competency around such a flammable liquid. Stocking shelves may be a good fit for you. I know I&#039;m being a bit of a dick, but seriously, you&#039;re not going to get away with that for long, assuming you&#039;re not a troll.</p> <p class=\"postedit\"><em>Last edited by frithnar (2014-01-28 01:43:13)</em></p>",

Encryption is your friend. That&#039;s how you can remain secure even in the face of the NSA.&#039; Photograph: Beck Diefenbach/Reuters</p><p>Now that we have enough details about how the NSA eavesdrops on the internet, including today&#039;s disclosures of the NSA&#039;s deliberate weakening of cryptographic systems, we can finally start to figure out how to protect ourselves.</p><p>For the past two weeks, I have been working with the Guardian on NSA stories, and have read hundreds of top-secret NSA documents provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden. I wasn&#039;t part of today&#039;s story – it was in process well before I showed up – but everything I read confirms what the Guardian is reporting.</p><p>At this point, I feel I can provide some advice for keeping secure against such an adversary.</p><p>The primary way the NSA eavesdrops on internet communications is in the network. That&#039;s where their capabilities best scale. They have invested in enormous programs to automatically collect and analyze network traffic. Anything that requires them to attack individual endpoint computers is significantly more costly and risky for them, and they will do those things carefully and sparingly.</p><p>Leveraging its secret agreements with telecommunications companies – all the US and UK ones, and many other &quot;partners&quot; around the world – the NSA gets access to the communications trunks that move internet traffic. In cases where it doesn&#039;t have that sort of friendly access, it does its best to surreptitiously monitor communications channels: tapping undersea cables, intercepting satellite communications, and so on.</p><p>That&#039;s an enormous amount of data, and the NSA has equivalently enormous capabilities to quickly sift through it all, looking for interesting traffic. &quot;Interesting&quot; can be defined in many ways: by the source, the destination, the content, the individuals involved, and so on. This data is funneled into the vast NSA system for future analysis.</p><p>The NSA collects much more metadata about internet traffic: who is talking to whom, when, how much, and by what mode of communication. Metadata is a lot easier to store and analyze than content. It can be extremely personal to the individual, and is enormously valuable intelligence.</p><p>The Systems Intelligence Directorate is in charge of data collection, and the resources it devotes to this is staggering. I read status report after status report about these programs, discussing capabilities, operational details, planned upgrades, and so on. Each individual problem – recovering electronic signals from fiber, keeping up with the terabyte streams as they go by, filtering out the interesting stuff – has its own group dedicated to solving it. Its reach is global.</p><p>The NSA also attacks network devices directly: routers, switches, firewalls, etc. Most of these devices have surveillance capabilities already built in; the trick is to surreptitiously turn them on. This is an especially fruitful avenue of attack; routers are updated less frequently, tend not to have security software installed on them, and are generally ignored as a vulnerability.</p><p>The NSA also devotes considerable resources to attacking endpoint computers. This kind of thing is done by its TAO – Tailored Access Operations – group. TAO has a menu of exploits it can serve up against your computer – whether you&#039;re running Windows, Mac OS, Linux, iOS, or something else – and a variety of tricks to get them on to your computer. Your anti-virus software won&#039;t detect them, and you&#039;d have trouble finding them even if you knew where to look. These are hacker tools designed by hackers with an essentially unlimited budget. What I took away from reading the Snowden documents was that if the NSA wants in to your computer, it&#039;s in. Period.</p><p>The NSA deals with any encrypted data it encounters more by subverting the underlying cryptography than by leveraging any secret mathematical breakthroughs. First, there&#039;s a lot of bad cryptography out there. If it finds an internet connection protected by MS-CHAP, for example, that&#039;s easy to break and recover the key. It exploits poorly chosen user passwords, using the same dictionary attacks hackers use in the unclassified world.</p><p>As was revealed today, the NSA also works with security product vendors to ensure that commercial encryption products are broken in secret ways that only it knows about. We know this has happened historically: CryptoAG and Lotus Notes are the most public examples, and there is evidence of a back door in Windows. A few people have told me some recent stories about their experiences, and I plan to write about them soon. Basically, the NSA asks companies to subtly change their products in undetectable ways: making the random number generator less random, leaking the key somehow, adding a common exponent to a public-key exchange protocol, and so on. If the back door is discovered, it&#039;s explained away as a mistake. And as we now know, the NSA has enjoyed enormous success from this program.</p><p>TAO also hacks into computers to recover long-term keys. So if you&#039;re running a VPN that uses a complex shared secret to protect your data and the NSA decides it cares, it might try to steal that secret. This kind of thing is only done against high-value targets.</p><p>How do you communicate securely against such an adversary? Snowden said it in an online Q&amp;A soon after he made his first document public: &quot;Encryption works. Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on.&quot;</p><p>I believe this is true, despite today&#039;s revelations and tantalizing hints of &quot;groundbreaking cryptanalytic capabilities&quot; made by James Clapper, the director of national intelligence in another top-secret document. Those capabilities involve deliberately weakening the cryptography.</p><p>Snowden&#039;s follow-on sentence is equally important: &quot;Unfortunately, endpoint security is so terrifically weak that NSA can frequently find ways around it.&quot;</p><p>Endpoint means the software you&#039;re using, the computer you&#039;re using it on, and the local network you&#039;re using it in. If the NSA can modify the encryption algorithm or drop a Trojan on your computer, all the cryptography in the world doesn&#039;t matter at all. If you want to remain secure against the NSA, you need to do your best to ensure that the encryption can operate unimpeded.</p><p>With all this in mind, I have five pieces of advice:</p><p>1) Hide in the network. Implement hidden services. Use Tor to anonymize yourself. Yes, the NSA targets Tor users, but it&#039;s work for them. The less obvious you are, the safer you are.</p><p>2) Encrypt your communications. Use TLS. Use IPsec. Again, while it&#039;s true that the NSA targets encrypted connections – and it may have explicit exploits against these protocols – you&#039;re much better protected than if you communicate in the clear.</p><p>3) Assume that while your computer can be compromised, it would take work and risk on the part of the NSA – so it probably isn&#039;t. If you have something really important, use an air gap. Since I started working with the Snowden documents, I bought a new computer that has never been connected to the internet. If I want to transfer a file, I encrypt the file on the secure computer and walk it over to my internet computer, using a USB stick. To decrypt something, I reverse the process. This might not be bulletproof, but it&#039;s pretty good.</p><p>4) Be suspicious of commercial encryption software, especially from large vendors. My guess is that most encryption products from large US companies have NSA-friendly back doors, and many foreign ones probably do as well. It&#039;s prudent to assume that foreign products also have foreign-installed backdoors. Closed-source software is easier for the NSA to backdoor than open-source software. Systems relying on master secrets are vulnerable to the NSA, through either legal or more clandestine means.</p><p>5) Try to use public-domain encryption that has to be compatible with other implementations. For example, it&#039;s harder for the NSA to backdoor TLS than BitLocker, because any vendor&#039;s TLS has to be compatible with every other vendor&#039;s TLS, while BitLocker only has to be compatible with itself, giving the NSA a lot more freedom to make changes. And because BitLocker is proprietary, it&#039;s far less likely those changes will be discovered. Prefer symmetric cryptography over public-key cryptography. Prefer conventional discrete-log-based systems over elliptic-curve systems; the latter have constants that the NSA influences when they can.</p><p>Since I started working with Snowden&#039;s documents, I have been using GPG, Silent Circle, Tails, OTR, TrueCrypt, BleachBit, and a few other things I&#039;m not going to write about. There&#039;s an undocumented encryption feature in my Password Safe program from the command line); I&#039;ve been using that as well.</p><p>I understand that most of this is impossible for the typical internet user. Even I don&#039;t use all these tools for most everything I am working on. And I&#039;m still primarily on Windows, unfortunately. Linux would be safer.</p><p>The NSA has turned the fabric of the internet into a vast surveillance platform, but they are not magical. They&#039;re limited by the same economic realities as the rest of us, and our best defense is to make surveillance of us as expensive as possible.</p><p>Trust the math. Encryption is your friend. Use it well, and do your best to ensure that nothing can compromise it. That&#039;s how you can remain secure even in the face of the NSA.</p><p>&#160; &#160; Print this</p><p>Article history<br />The NSA Files: Decoded</p><p>What the surveillance revelations mean for you<br />World news</p><p>&#160; &#160; NSA ·<br />&#160; &#160; Surveillance ·<br />&#160; &#160; United States ·<br />&#160; &#160; The NSA files</p><p>Technology</p><p>&#160; &#160; Data and computer security ·<br />&#160; &#160; Data protection ·<br />&#160; &#160; Internet</p><p>More news</p><p>More comment</p><p>&#160; &#160; More on NSA surveillance</p><p>&#160; &#160; Various items: NSA stories around the world</p><p>&#160; &#160; NSA headquarters</p><p>&#160; &#160; NSA violations led judge to consider viability of surveillance program</p><p>&#160; &#160; Declassified documents from 2009 suggest NSA officials gave misleading statements to court and reveal judge placed a siginifcant restriction the bulk records program</p><p>&#160; &#160; Obama&#039;s NSA surveillance review panel did not discuss changes, attendees say</p><p>Guardian Bookshop: The Snowden Files by Luke Harding</p><p>&#160; &#160; A real-life political thriller telling the story of the individuals behind the most spectacular intelligence breach in history.</p><p>&#160; &#160; Click here to order the book for just £8.99 (save £4).</p><p>&#160; &#160; Share<br />&#160; &#160; Tweet this<br />&#160; &#160; Email</p>",

        "content": "<p>I have dealt with this seller for several months now on Agora Marketplace. I have never had an issue with him, and the cocaine is by far the best for the price. </p><p>I use the coke personally and find it to be of a perfect level of quality for a night out. A very nice buzz. Not too overpowering, but just enough to make you chat shit and knock back the pints like an animal. Although it is worth noting that I am generally not a fan of &#039;pure&#039; coke. I don&#039;t like being too wired and not being able to sleep. If you&#039;re into getting wired off your tits then this gear ain&#039;t for you. It is very much &#039;social&#039; cocaine. </p><p>I have had coke from LegalEyez (although it&#039;s been proven that it contains no coke) and can say that FerrariBlacks gear is way better. I don&#039;t know why anyone would order from LegalEyez when you can get this stuff for the same price!</p><p>I also used to order quite regularly from ToYouTeam. Since ordering FB&#039;s stuff I have not ordered from TYT. The quality is near enough on par, maybe very slightly worse, but for the price it&#039;s worth it. </p><p>I sell this gear on for £30/g to my friends and they&#039;ve never complained. I have sold it on to people I don&#039;t know for £40/g easy.</p><p>Delivery has ALWAYS been next day in UK. </p><p>Stealth is your standard vac sealed bag in a padded envelope. </p><p>I will continue to order from FB for as long as he is selling. Even if I decided I wanted to do better coke myself I would still stock up to resell as I am making an extra couple hundred quid a month. </p><p>Quality - 9/10 (as &#039;Social&#039; Coke)<br />Delivery - 10/10 (Next Day UK, every time)<br />Stealth - 7/10 (The vac sealed bag isn&#039;t the greatest stealth but it&#039;s always worked and I&#039;ve never had an issue)<br />Communication - 10/10 (Seller has always responded to my messages promptly and in a friendly manner)</p>",

I have never had an issue with him, and the cocaine is by far the best for the price. </p><p>I use the coke personally and find it to be of a perfect level of quality for a night out. A very nice buzz. Not too overpowering, but just enough to make you chat shit and knock back the pints like an animal. Although it is worth noting that I am generally not a fan of &#039;pure&#039; coke. I don&#039;t like being too wired and not being able to sleep. If you&#039;re into getting wired off your tits then this gear ain&#039;t for you. It is very much &#039;social&#039; cocaine. </p><p>I have had coke from LegalEyez (although it&#039;s been proven that it contains no coke) and can say that FerrariBlacks gear is way better. I don&#039;t know why anyone would order from LegalEyez when you can get this stuff for the same price!</p><p>I also used to order quite regularly from ToYouTeam. Since ordering FB&#039;s stuff I have not ordered from TYT. The quality is near enough on par, maybe very slightly worse, but for the price it&#039;s worth it. </p><p>I sell this gear on for £30/g to my friends and they&#039;ve never complained. I have sold it on to people I don&#039;t know for £40/g easy.</p><p>Delivery has ALWAYS been next day in UK. </p><p>Stealth is your standard vac sealed bag in a padded envelope. </p><p>I will continue to order from FB for as long as he is selling. Even if I decided I wanted to do better coke myself I would still stock up to resell as I am making an extra couple hundred quid a month. </p><p>Quality - 9/10 (as &#039;Social&#039; Coke)<br />Delivery - 10/10 (Next Day UK, every time)<br />Stealth - 7/10 (The vac sealed bag isn&#039;t the greatest stealth but it&#039;s always worked and I&#039;ve never had an issue)<br />Communication - 10/10 (Seller has always responded to my messages promptly and in a friendly manner)</p>",

I don&#039;t personally like heavily cut coke as my nose tolerates cuts like old people fuck, but I&#039;d buy it just to keep for mates that might call round on a Saturday if it was available.</p><p>FB, do you have any cut-off time for orders?

        "content": "<p>Hi all</p><p>Ok I have sampled a few different deliveries from these guys over a period of weeks. Mainly the basic good quality but also little of the fish-scale quality. I have done the same with the most popular 3 other of the UK and NL vendors that I won&#039;t name here. They are all very different in their approach and all have merits.</p><p>I do not use EZ testers much because they can be fooled and even if they indicated good amounts of Cocaine HCL they do not tell you what the adulterants are. It is far more important to know what adulterants are in there than the absolute purity. E.g. Give me a bag of 1g Cocaine HCl of even just 20% purity as long as it is just cut with inert adulterants then I&#039;m a happy man. Give me 60% purity and cut with shite to make it feel purer then I get pissed off.</p><p>What I can say about these guys is their core, high quality fish-scale supply is good and clean from source. Not too much shit in from source so you get a really nice euphoric high from it. It can be cleaned up (there are various washes) and it is that is something I would do to improve it more but as it is, for the price it is very good. Washing this stuff is just for old gits like me who think the 80&#039;s were the only time you could get good gear.</p><p>Their basic stuff is based in the clean core fish-scale but cut down (as you&#039;d expect for the lower cost!). Bit the thing is that it seems to be cut down with inert adulterants so you don&#039;t spoil the high. I haven&#039;t detected any amphetamines, ephedrine, speeds etc. only some left over crap from the original production (before import) which is easily washed out. There are a lot of vendors out there selling similar purity but with nasty shit cut in.</p><p>So, what I&#039;m trying to say is this.</p><p>You buy a basic good quality g of C from these guys and you are getting reasonable purity that is not cut with shit that will ruin your high. You get the purity you pay for and an honesty about what they cut with which is very, very cool.</p><p>I will order again and I hope they stay safe, secure and do not let their quality, security or principles slip.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Horrifying revelations....</p><br /><br /><p>James Glanz, Jeff Larson and Andrew W. Lehren, The New York Times | Updated: January 28, 2014</p><br /><p>When a smartphone user opens Angry Birds, the popular game application, and starts slinging birds at chortling green pigs, spies could be lurking in the background to snatch data revealing the player&#039;s location, age, sex and other personal information, according to secret British intelligence documents. </p><p>In their globe-spanning surveillance for terrorism suspects and other targets, the National Security Agency and its British counterpart have been trying to exploit a basic byproduct of modern telecommunications: With each new generation of mobile phone technology, ever greater amounts of personal data pour onto networks where spies can pick it up. </p><p>According to dozens of previously undisclosed classified documents, among the most valuable of those unintended intelligence tools are so-called leaky apps that spew everything from the smartphone identification codes of users to where they have been that day. </p><p>The NSA and Britain&#039;s Government Communications Headquarters were working together on how to collect and store data from dozens of smartphone apps by 2007, according to the documents, provided by Edward J. Snowden, the former NSA contractor. Since then, the agencies have traded recipes for grabbing location and planning data when a target uses Google Maps, and for vacuuming up address books, buddy lists, telephone logs and the geographic data embedded in photographs when someone sends a post to the mobile versions of Facebook, Flickr, LinkedIn, Twitter and other Internet services. </p><p>The eavesdroppers&#039; pursuit of mobile networks has been outlined in earlier reports, but the secret documents, shared by The New York Times, The Guardian and ProPublica, offer far more details of their ambitions for smartphones and the apps that run on them. The efforts were part of an initiative called &quot;the mobile surge,&quot; according to a 2011 British document, an analogy to the troop surges in Iraq and Afghanistan. One NSA analyst&#039;s enthusiasm was evident in the breathless title - &quot;Golden Nugget!&quot; - given to one slide for a top-secret 2010 talk that described iPhones and Android phones as rich resources, another document noted. </p><p>The scale and the specifics of the data haul are not clear. The documents show that the NSA and the British agency routinely obtain information from certain apps, particularly some of those introduced earliest to cellphones. With some newer apps, including Angry Birds, the agencies have a similar capability, the documents show, but they do not make explicit whether the spies have put that into practice. Some personal data, developed in profiles by advertising companies, could be particularly sensitive: A secret 2012 British intelligence document says that spies can scrub smartphone apps to collect details like a user&#039;s &quot;political alignment&quot; and sexual orientation.</p>",

They use a third party website called btcmerch.com to accept payments. First instincts said no. But I might try to talk to them as a reseller. (Actually I do have buyers that resell them overseas.)

I have contacts reselling iPhone 5S, iPads, MacBooks, and iPods overseas and would take tons of these products. I&#039;ll be honest. I like the graphics of your website. Your pricing seems pretty competitive. But most importantly, I&#039;d like to make sure that I can trust you. We all know there are plenty of scammers around conning money under the banner of Apple Products. I&#039;ve seen that you use btcmerch.com to accept payment. But I&#039;d be a fool if I trust just any third party payment websites. Before I can hand over my clients&#039; money to you, I&#039;d like to know more details about your services like how you acquired these Apple Products. Carded them? Got them from repair? Or something else. What is the shipping price and will they pass the customs without tariff? I don&#039;t need to know every detail but at least some answers are needed before I can make a decision.</p><p>Hope to hear back from you soon.</p><p>fnu<br />----------------------------------</p><p>Let&#039;s see how this goes.</p><p>fnu</p>",

I have contacts reselling iPhone 5S, iPads, MacBooks, and iPods overseas and would take tons of these products. I&#039;ll be honest. I like the graphics of your website. Your pricing seems pretty competitive. But most importantly, I&#039;d like to make sure that I can trust you. We all know there are plenty of scammers around conning money under the banner of Apple Products. I&#039;ve seen that you use btcmerch.com to accept payment. But I&#039;d be a fool if I trust just any third party payment websites. Before I can hand over my clients&#039; money to you, I&#039;d like to know more details about your services like how you acquired these Apple Products. Carded them? Got them from repair? Or something else. What is the shipping price and will they pass the customs without tariff? I don&#039;t need to know every detail but at least some answers are needed before I can make a decision.</p><p>Hope to hear back from you soon.</p><p>fnu<br />----------------------------------</p><p>Let&#039;s see how this goes.</p><p>fnu</p>",

        "content": "<p>Havent carded egift cards in quite a long time, but some places I used to do that I didn&#039;t notice anyone else doing:</p><p>1. Loccitane.com ( High end french boutique chain in US and EU instant egift cards sent via email ) Increments of $200 I think, sell CRAZY fast on CL 70% np. Girls eat these up if you live in / near major cities in US/EU, but for other countries they can be used online. I&#039;ve found these lasted longer than the rest. I haven&#039;t tested these in a year atleast though, lol. Great way to make some side cash for beginners, with bonus of meeting hotties consistently ( not in your hometown or using your real # of course, and if you keep doing it in same area someone will sting youre ass, lol ), but if youre a mobile instore guy this is a great way to make a few k straight to your hotel the few days before you leave for the next city. Always test a few by buying some on a few different days spread out then checking the balances 1,2,3,4,5,6 etc days out to see how long they last. You dont want to play with fire selling gcs from your hotel area 3 days before you leave if they go bad in 24 hours, lol =P</p><p>2. LordandTaylor.com&#160; I used to kill these guys, lol. Nice clothes, shoes, cologne, hygiene stuff, suits, great instore selection with auto readers posted on pillars away from counters so you can scan your egift cards before you check out to verify they&#039;re still good ( meant to check balance, will say 0$ if its been cancelled ). Their fraud dept was still pretty shitty about a year ago, I imagine its the same. Could card from same ip to different emails, over and over, and over. Today you&#039;d probably want to play it smart with some easy basics, vpn, socks (cc city/state), bleachbit when done, rinse, repeat ) I&#039;ve only tried uS cvv.</p><p>3. TheLimited.com Clothing store for women, not even sure theyre still around because this one was atleast two years ago. Suprisingly I remember these selling well on CL. I took my gf there one time and she hated it, but they had their store right next to a gucci store in a plaza mall with nothing but high end retailers from side to side. She said nothing was &quot;branded&quot; that she could recognize, it all felt like cheap material, and reminded her of old secretaries or librarian clothing, lol. Whatever, if they sell they sell =P</p><p>These are all common sense, but just incase, food etc:</p><p>Sonic<br />Dunkin Donuts<br />Starbucks<br />Caribou Coffee <br />Jack in the box</p><p>Again its been like a year or two atleast since I&#039;ve used these, so test before taking my word =P I&#039;m sure I have more egift card places I&#039;ll have to think on. I havent carded online in years haha.</p><p>Cool thread, stuff like this is great. I loved when I first started and people would share little shit like this here and there.</p>",

Not only this, but what if the original owner has SMS notifications or email on there phone, the payment will get charged back and it&#039;s game over for that account, money wasted. Also, you&#039;d need a drop address as paypal records the shipping address entered in orders. </p><p>People mainly buy fresh paypal accounts with no balance in order to launder money, but there&#039;s tons of other reasons.</p>",

        "content": "<p>First, do some research on PayPal. When you buy an account from any vendor, check the owners address, then match your Socks proxy nearer to them. After you login, do not cash out or buy anything immediately. Go through transaction history. Note the size of funds the owner transfers. Note whether he is sending money to other accounts often or is he buying anything. Now match your activities to the owner and try to be legit.<br />Zero balance accounts are used for cashing out or as middleman account. This is used to extend the time of getting a charge back and giving you the time to cash out. And one last thing no one will sell Apple Mac for 500$. If you saw an ad in the deep web, it is just a scam.</p> <p class=\"postedit\"><em>Last edited by monkey (2014-01-28 18:52:02)</em></p>",

        "content": "<p>This guide covers one method I used to use for postal money orders. Postal money orders are super easy to cash at any post office with a fake id if you&#039;re mobile / have cashiers, but can be laundered easily as well. Victims feel safe paying with them because of some inherint trust they hold with the US post office, lol. It couldn&#039;t be further from the truth. <br />It can take up to 45 days to get any kind of investigation underway, and the likliehood of you triggering an investigation using this is slim.</p><p>This is a great side hustle to have in your inventory because it requires virtually no setup time ( 15 minutes ) and after that it&#039;s an autopilot extra <br />few k a week. This will yield 5-10 money orders ranging from $700-$1500 a week for very part timers.</p><p>This is a method meant for instore crews, and fraudsters who generally already go through a steady supply of ids for other needs. This will squeeze out another few k a week out of things you were likely finished with. I used this country wide while instoring as a way to cover my travel expenses so everything was profit in a sense. However the cost to profit ratio is plenty fine enough to do it as a stand alone and would be reasonible to buy fake ids specifically for this.</p><br /><p>What you&#039;ll need:</p><p>Email account<br />Fake ID<br />Visa or MC gc that requires no online activation and holds no avs ( or nonavs cvv )<br />Drop address</p><br /><p>1. Register on www.gunauction.com and www.gunbroker.com as sellers.<br />( USE same information, same card, same drop, email on both )</p><p>2. Google and Bing your way through firearm listings to find what you&#039;re going to be &quot;selling&quot;.<br />( Copy what you see, pics, description, etc. Go back to the websites mentioned where you&#039;re a registered seller and post your finds. I prefer to keep to <br />assault rifles, and antiques at 60% of value. Be sure to mention you&#039;re only method of payment is through a Secure US Postal Money Order, this will raise no red flags. )</p><p>3. Once you have about 10 listings ( 5 each on both sites ) sit back and wait for your auctions to buy out. If you have placed them appropriately someone will buy now <br />at your crazy low price! The target crowd here doesn&#039;t need a bunch of hand holding and assurances, lol.&#160; When the winners email you be sure to email them with a response similar too:</p><p>Ex. Hello,</p><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Noticed you bought my listing. You got a great buy there, at a very good deal. I hope it&#039;s going to a good home, lol <img src=\"http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/img/smilies/smile.png\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"smile\" /><br />&#160; &#160; &#160;Below is my address and where your firearm will be shipping from. Please be informed as per my auction that I only accept Postal money orders. I&#039;ve had<br />too many bad experiences with Western Union money orders and cashiers checks. If you could forward your FFL along with payment to:</p><p>Johnny B Good<br />123 Fake Street<br />wintertown, Sahara<br />0000000</p><p>Once I&#039;ve received your FFL and payment and I&#039;ll notify you with tracking as soon as it&#039;s shipped.</p><p>Thanks, Johnny</p><br /><p>** FYI: Many of your victims will be or claim to be LE. It&#039;s just a fact, especially when buying/selling firearms legally online ( a big % of those guys are LE in their real lives ). Don&#039;t shite your britches when you get crazy emails, lol. They&#039;re just upset =P You should be burning and working accounts fast enough to where you don&#039;t speak with these guys again anyway **</p><p>*** My posts and advice, and views are generally aimed toward those with a high mobility life style. I would never recommend using the things I talk about if you&#039;re some small town guy that&#039;s looking to &quot;break in&quot; on something***</p><p>**** There are a ton of ways to launder these things simply. I&#039;m not going to fill in blanks here because honestly it serves as a retard proofing of sorts. If you can&#039;t think your way out of &quot;How do these get to $$$$$?&quot; this is the wrong thread for you =P ****</p><p>P.S I&#039;ve cashed postal money orders from different states, while in a different state, using an out of state fake id with absolutely no issues in a lot of US states. From the little cow poke post offices in tinytown, usa to major metro post offices. $700 to $1500 no problem. If the office is small its good to call ahead and ask they can cash a postal mo for xxxx amount of dollars.</p> <p class=\"postedit\"><em>Last edited by lolwhat (2014-01-28 18:26:23)</em></p>",

And yeah, you only need 1200x1200 (2400 dpi); again he talks about needing this expensive scanner. Hell, even a cheap $50 all-in one will have a scanner that can grab the needed dpi to scan any bill.</p><p> As for the newsprint, I tried it as well but ran into the same issues as you with bills becoming to dark and just not printing well. Inkjet needs a really smooth surface to print well, otherwise it just blures to much. The newsprint only passes the pen test because it is 100% recycled; I found some bright white paper that is 100% recycled as well and that passes the pen but there is nothing available in the thickness needed for the 2 sheet method.</p><p>I just make my own true cotton rag paper from pulp and externally size it. I can get the paper to about a 45gsm thickness but it falls apart if I try to go any thinner in my mould. Glue these two sheets together and then putting them under 20 tons of pressure on a simple shop press can get them to about the right thickness.</p><p>My only issue is my paper seems to be more translucent and the strip and watermark are still a little visible with the 2 sheet method but it is still a lot more manageable than newsprint.</p><p>I bought two watermark screenprint inks from different suppliers over in China (I bought two because I wasn&#039;t sure if I was going to get scammed or not but both came through).&#160; So what is it?&#160; It works like they say but it was nothing more than white ink/paint but it created a darker image when held to the light.&#160; it is just basically printing a white image on a white piece of paper.&#160; Man did I feel dumb after I used that crap.&#160; Could of did all that for $10 from walmart. </p><p>China Man +1<br />Me: 0</p>",

        "content": "<p>I haven&#039;t tried the powdered glass thing either but he is so clueless on the other crap (ie: paper passing the pen test), that I am going to assume he has never done the glass thing either; it just sounds good on paper (maybe?)</p><p>I personally went through several canon inkjet printers and found they all have alignment issues; was very fustrating. And yeah, you only need 1200x1200 (2400 dpi); again he talks about needing this expensive scanner. Hell, even a cheap $50 all-in one will have a scanner that can grab the needed dpi to scan any bill.</p><p> As for the newsprint, I tried it as well but ran into the same issues as you with bills becoming to dark and just not printing well. Inkjet needs a really smooth surface to print well, otherwise it just blures to much. The newsprint only passes the pen test because it is 100% recycled; I found some bright white paper that is 100% recycled as well and that passes the pen but there is nothing available in the thickness needed for the 2 sheet method.</p><p>I just make my own true cotton rag paper from pulp and externally size it. I can get the paper to about a 45gsm thickness but it falls apart if I try to go any thinner in my mould. Glue these two sheets together and then putting them under 20 tons of pressure on a simple shop press can get them to about the right thickness.</p><p>My only issue is my paper seems to be more translucent and the strip and watermark are still a little visible with the 2 sheet method but it is still a lot more manageable than newsprint.</p><p>I bought two watermark screenprint inks from different suppliers over in China (I bought two because I wasn&#039;t sure if I was going to get scammed or not but both came through).&#160; So what is it?&#160; It works like they say but it was nothing more than white ink/paint but it created a darker image when held to the light.&#160; it is just basically printing a white image on a white piece of paper.&#160; Man did I feel dumb after I used that crap.&#160; Could of did all that for $10 from walmart. </p><p>China Man +1<br />Me: 0</p>",

Different security features, different holograms, different types of paper. I can&#039;t tell you much about how to make counterfeits, but I can tell you this. What the market needs the most is 1:1 coloring. Whether you are buying CF bills or you are an aspiring counterfeiter: Get the colors right. The feel can be faked, the security measures arent checked much when it looks real from afar and it feels real.</p><p>Blacktulip, I don&#039;t know if its worth the time/effort/money but I stumbled upon this link once http://<em>*scam*</em>.onion/index.php Its mr mouse&#039;s little hub. Personally think hes shady as fuck, but you might feel like looking into it.</p><p>Edit: oh yea, mr mouse and evo administration kinda had a fallout, so you cant see the link ^^ PM me if youre really interested.</p> <p class=\"postedit\"><em>Last edited by BlueHighSky (2014-11-11 17:07:12)</em></p>",

But i guess it would ruin the ink on the paper if the gel is water based so all laquers and everything is off? I&#039;m seriously out of ideas, as for stamps would it be a good idea to use a 3D printer to do the stamps, would it be different than making the stamps out of material they are usually made like rubber or it doesn&#039;t really matter? If anyone has any tips or ideas please do so. If anyone has any other questions regarding counterfeiting i&#039;m happy to share my knowlendge aswell. Thanks</p>",

I know that it will be a really hard time to produce the first really useful notes. I will do as lot of work I have to do and will put a lot of time in it. But only with learning theory I will never be able to produce good notes, I could learn by reading for 3 years and it wouldnt be possible to make good notes without trying before. My problem is, that I dont have the paper what I need to start trying and working on it. I really need this paper and really want to start with working on it. It isn&#039;t in my interest to sell them here in the networks, I want to directly share it in stores &amp; so on. I have already fixed out my system, which is working and safe for me. But I really want to produce by my self and not only buying. I will buy ready notes too at the beginning, but want to produce for myself at the end. Maybe can you help me FRIM or somebody else ? I just need this contact this is the most important for me a seller for paper with watermark and security thread.</p>",

I not yet tested to use the dark watermark ink for printing the metal thread. <br />Anybody who is a nice guy and shares with us the information for a nice printer to use for free? My problem is to print the bills in highquality that its even possible to see the very small micronumbers and lines on the background structure. How can I print this micro parts?

Which also makes it easier to pass off higher purchases or more ,they are Corporate cards all business and corporation owners with either big credit or big balance or both.</p> <p class=\"postedit\"><em>Last edited by Container45158 (2014-02-01 14:09:31)</em></p>",
