I am no longer going to take the risk of new buyers over-checking tracking.** Feb 19th 2015- Cant believe were still chugging along  - Made computer listing skeletons, will populate with pictures of every computer offered.- Adding a bulk slides listing for people buying a minimum order of 4 slides.** Feb 24th, 2015 It seems there is some confusion regarding my discount policy, I have always run with the policy that Glock slides get a little cheaper after weve worked together and have established history. At NO time have I mentioned that OTHER items (barrels, other gun parts, etc) get cheaper. There is a reason for this. The more I order Glock slides from my supplier, the CHEAPER I GET THEM. I cannot get cheap gun parts in general, I charge roughly 100% of the list price and a little bit for shipping (depending on the item). This is the LOWEST price I will offer to you, if youre in search of a bulky item (eg. an AR upper) or a really expensive item (eg. thermal optics), the price on your end WILL BE HIGHER.So to recap:If you buy a TON of Glock slides, there is a price break on successive ordersIf you buy a TON of Glock barrels, AR/AK parts, Anything OTHER THAN a GLOCK SLIDE, there IS NO BREAKK? I hope this helps. 3  Kisses  :-* ps. Price breaks on other items will always be considered depending on the country Im shipping to, the item(s) ordered, and the status of our relationship.

The price of his listings was so damn low I thought it had to be an error, or a scam, or some other strings were attached... But there werent. The price was actually true. Im getting a damned iMac which is worth 3400 euro for roughly 700 euro. Review so far (will update once I have my item)Vendor Communication: 10/10Response time: 10/10Price: 19/10Item overall:condition:FE: No, vendor only wants full evo escrowPrice/Quality:Would order again?
