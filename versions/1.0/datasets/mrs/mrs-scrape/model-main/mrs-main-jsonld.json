According to this spray-based method, mainly thermospray, solutions of semiconductor salts are first sprayed into monodispersed droplets, which subsequently become solid nanoparticles by solvent evaporation. A semiconductor nanoparticle is produced from a single spray droplet upon the full vaporization of the solvent. The average diameter and size distribution of the final nanocrystals are controlled and determined by the solute concentration of the sprayed solution and by the droplet size, hence by the spray production parameters. The spray-produced nanocrystals are collected on any selected solid support. Representative results, shown in this paper, reveal the formation of CdS nanocrystals in the size range of 3 to 6 nanometer and with a size distribution of as low as five percents. A further structural analysis of these nanocrystals showed that they were formed in the zinc blend phase with high degree of crystallinity.",

In this study, we further refined this technique and applied it to low-friction and high-hardness Cu-doped MoN films. These magnetron sputtered nanocomposites films consist of MoN, Mo2N, and Cu phases, whose ratio depends on Cu concentration. By using the microdiffraction technique, we discovered that both the deviatoric and the hydrostatic components of the residual stresses depend on the film depth (Fig.1). The former indicates depth-dependent distribution of biaxial stresses, while the latter implies depth-dependent defect distribution, which also depends on Cu concentration. Thermal annealing of the nanocomposite film partially relives the stress, significantly reduces the lattice spacing, and eliminates the defect gradients. These results suggest that interstitial N may play an important role in the lattice expansion and the defect gradients formed during the non-equilibrium sputtering process. Our study provides fresh insights into understanding the structure-property relations in the magnetron sputtered MoN:Cu nanocomposites films.",

        "text": "Silicon Nanowires (SiNWs) have many potential applications that include diodes, transistors, logic gates, circuitry, and sensors. SiNWs also open the possibility for integrating optoelectronics with microelectronics, since silicon has semiconducting properties and amorphous silicon nanowires have been shown to emit blue light. It has been demonstrated that SiNWs have tunable electrical properties, depending on the dopant used. With such a range of applications, the ability to mass-produce silicon nanowires simply and easily with no other source of silicon needed other than the substrate itself will prove very useful. Such methods have previously been reported, but our method involves production of the SiNWs at a lower temperature than those widely observed. A (100) silicon substrate was cleaned for five minutes each in ethanol followed by acetone. Films with thicknesses of less than 20 nm of either gold or 60/40 gold/palladium were deposited on the substrate through physical vapor deposition to serve as the growth center for the SiNWs. The samples were placed in a furnace and annealed to 900° C, under a 1500 sccm flow of argon at atmospheric pressure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used for characterization of the SiNWs. The resulting SiNWs were amorphous in structure and very convoluted, with lengths on the order of tens of microns, diameters of 40 nm and a bed thickness of approximately 10 m. The effect of varying gold concentration, annealing time, temperature, and gas flow rate were then investigated. The results, which will be discussed in further detail, indicate that adjusting these parameters allows for control over the length, thickness, density, and morphology of the nanowires.",

While the miscible blends showed a simple additivity behavior with regard to their foaming characteristics and properties, a significant influence of the initial blend morphology is demonstrated for the multiphase blends.",

A two-stage phase formation process was observed in the ignition experiment. The first step is the lateral growth of Al3Ni phase from isolated nucleation sites and the following coalescence into a continuous layer; the second step is the growth of such Al3Ni layers in the perpendicular direction of the interface until all Al is consumed. As there is still Ni available, Al3Ni will continuously react with Ni until no Ni is left, and the final reaction product turns out to be ordered B2 AlNi compound. X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments showed that the reaction product of the cold rolled foil was the same as the physical vapor deposition (PVD) foil. The reaction process was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Three peaks can be identified from the DSC curve. Cold rolled foils were heated to different peak temperatures obtained from DSC curve with the same heating rate as DSC. XRD results for such foils showed that the first two peaks were the exothermic formation of Al3Ni, while the last one was for the formation of AlNi. The enthalpy of the reaction for the cold rolled foil was calculated to be -57.5 KJ/mol, which was in good agreement with the formation enthalpy of AlNi (-59 KJ/mol). The reaction velocities of the first formation stage were measured to be 7mm/s for cold rolled foils, which were much smaller than the reaction velocities of PVD foils (which range between 1-30 m/s).",

The x-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) show that the nanocrystals fabricated by the different methods are under optimized growth conditions single crystals of zincblende structure and of regular spherical shape. The average size was estimated to be between 2.0-3.0 nm with a size dispersion that depends on the synthesis route and is in the range between 10% and 20%. The XPS results indicate that for the nanoparticles obtained via solventless strategy the sulfur is present both as bonded to the metal atom and to the organic residue, while in the TOPO synthesized nanoparticles the sulfur signal has only one component associated to the metal-sulfide bond. The photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) analysis of CdS crystals clearly evidences the typical emissions of nanosized zincblende CdS monocrystalline particles. Furthermore, the optical spectroscopy data indicate that the size distribution of the Cdsulfide - TOPO nanoparticles seems to be generally larger than that ones grown directly in polymer matrix. For all the CdS samples, the metal-sulfide nanocrystals exhibit a trap-related radiative transition at about 2eV that can be attributed to the hole-electron recombination at particle surface defect-center.",

A new approach to prepare Ge nanocrystals of high chemical yield by reduction of GeI2 with LiAlH4 in trioctylphosphine (TOP) at 300°C is also presented.

Compared to the supercritical organic solvents investigated in the previous study to make Ge nanoparticles, the reaction in sc-CO2 produced much less organic contaminants and made the removal of by-products and cleaning of the nanocrystals much easier. While Ge nanoparticles were synthesized in sc-CO2 with DPG and octanol, bulk Ge instead of nanoparticles was obtained without the presence of CO2 at the same concentration of DPG and octanol.

        "text": "Composite approaches, e.g. with mutually immiscible constituents or including at least one refractory phase, present a viable and maybe even necessary route for stabilizing massive nanostructured materials against detrimental coarsening under thermal and/or mechanical loading conditions [1]. A different way for nanoscaled composite formation is presented by the nanocrystallization of marginally glass-forming amorphous alloys, such as Al-rich alloys with rare earth and transition metal additions. Such composite systems that are stabilized at nanometer-scaled structure sizes due to diffusion limitations have conventionally been processed by supplying thermal energy for initiating the nanocrystal formation [2]. New opportunities for fabricating massive nanocrystalline composites in bulk quantities and with improved microstructures from such alloys might be based on the plastic deformation of the amorphous quenching products, as indicated by the observation of nanocrystallization in shear bands [3-5].ere, different deformation methods with largely different strain and pressure levels have been applied on rapidly quenched Al-rich metallic glasses in order to investigate the strain-induced nanocrystal formation. The results indicate e.g. that shear straining under a high pressure and to large strain values can produce uniform nanocrystalline structures in bulk samples, which is essential to their functional performance. Moreover, detailed structure analyses indicate that the amorphous structure of the entire sample volume, and not only the shear band regions, might be affected by the plastic deformation. In addition to the significance concerning the understanding of the deformation of glasses, the results also indicate the applicability of the new processing routes for synthesizing massive, porosity-free nanocrystalline materials.[1]\tG.

        "text": "The national high magnetic field laboratory builds and uses various high field magnets for fundamental research.  In building high field magnets, a variety of high strength composites are required because of the Lorentz stresses generated by high field exceeding the strength of most of the materials, particular conductors. For example, a field of 60 T can generate a magnetic pressure that corresponds to a stress in the conductor of 1.5 GPa, which is at the limit of known conducting materials with conductivity higher than 70% International Annealed Copper Standard and sizes suitable for building high field magnets. The design of high field magnets is limited by these forces and, consequently, by the available materials. At the same time, the materials need to have excellent physical properties.  For instance, the conductors need to have high electrical conductivity and high specific heat and the superconductors should have high critical current in field and low alternative current losses.  This paper outlines our requirements and research on metal matrix composite materials for building high field magnets. The discussions include both the macrocomposite and microcomposite.  The scales of the structures in the composites are from millimeters to nanometers.",

Aging the solution for several days a black powder precipitated made of a mixture of one amorphous phase and crystalline Bi2S3. When two capsules interacted between each other, the capsule regions in contact crystallized into bismuth sulfide, which explains the origin of the crystalline phase observed in the X-ray diffraction pattern. At this temperature, aggregation of the small nanocapsules also gave rise to necklaces of capsules, which eventually gave rise to nanotubes; these necklaces ordered forming bundles parallel to their largest dimension. When the solution was annealed at temperatures lower than 100 °C, aggregation gave rise to capsules as large as 1 μm in diameter, and tubes with similar diameters; in this case aggregation occurred between small and large nanocapsules. Because of the monomers aggregating had an external spherical symmetry and the low annealing temperatures, which were not high enough to produce sintering, all capsules and tubes formed during aggregation had porous walls, making these materials interesting for many applications.",

Due to the former requirement, thermal pastes are among some of the most highly-filled composite systems in practice (solids volume fraction > 70%). These materials are expected to withstand the significant normal forces, lateral forces, and temperature variations associated with chip operations and power off/on transitions. The structural changes and degradation of various thermal pastes during power cycling have been characterized using optical microscopy and IR thermography.

        "text": "Thermal spray is a significantly advanced but inherently complex deposition process that involves successive impingement of molten droplets on a substrate to form coating with a ¡°brick-wall¡± layered structure. The anisotropic microstructure of coatings is very sensitive to processing conditions and has significant influence on the properties. This study aims to understand the processing-microstructure-thermal property correlation of thermally sprayed coatings. Thermal transport properties of three coating systems forming composites with pores (yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) -Air), a second phase (Mo-Mo2C) and a graded material (YSZ-NiCrAlY) are interpreted from the point of view of microstructure and chemical composition. In the case of YSZ-Air composite, results indicate that porosity contribution from 20-35% decreases the thermal conductivity by 50-70% of the bulk value. For the intrinsic composite of Mo and Mo2C, which coexist as stable phases, thermal conductivity increases significantly with 1.75wt% carbon addition since it reduces formation of MoO2 during processing, but decreases with 3.5wt% carbon addition. This is attributed to larger carbide retention in the latter. For the discrete layered and graded composites of YSZ-NiCrAlY, which are made up of varying fractions of these two constituents,  thermal conductivity decreases sharply up to 40wt% YSZ and then more gradually with increasing YSZ content. This paper examines these experimental findings by treating the these complex coatings as multiphase composites.",

Previously, nanoindentation of bulk InGaAs at 300K gave a yield pressure of 6GPa (Jayawera et al Proc. Roy Soc, A459, 2049, 2003) while bending at 500 centigrade gave a yield value of 30MPa (Pp\u2019 ng et al Phil. Mag. 85, 4429, 2005). In contrast, coherently strained InGaAs superlattices gave nanoindentation values of 3GPa at room temperature and bending at 500oC gave a yield value also around 3GPa. It appears that the coherency strain can impart an athermal strengthening to the superlattice. It is clearly necessary to do mechanical testing over the range 300-800K that will be able to link the room temperature nanoindentation with the results from the high temperature bending experiment and to determine the relationship between strength, coherency strain and temperature. Preliminary experiments on these samples at elevated temperatures using a hot stage and the UMIS nanoindentation system is difficult but feasible with the help of AFM to verify the contact area.",

Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) is a high spatial resolution (probe sizes < 100nm) analytical technique which is sensitive to variations in carbon or nitrogen stoichiometry. This sensitivity to light elements depends on the ability to relate the measured EELS spectrum to a material's electronic structure. The unique capabilities of EELS for the characterization of carbonitrides with high spatial resolution are discussed along with some of the experimental and analytical methods used to relate measured spectra to electronic structure.

        "text": "Bulk metallic glass (BMG) has been of intense interest recently because of its unique combination of excellent mechanical properties including high strength. One of the major drawbacks of monolithic BMG materials is the limited ductility due to strain localization. Except a few recent reports on monolithic ductile BMG, the most popular method to enhance the ductility of the BMG samples is to introduce a crystalline or quasicrystalline phase by precipitation or mixing. The composite material usually exhibits some degree of strain hardening along with significantly higher impact resistance and fracture toughness. However, the mechanism of this strain hardening is not well understood. We present simulated uniaxial compression tests on a monatomic model amorphous system embedded with body-center cubic (BCC) nanocrystals. The advantage of this model system is that intimate amorphous-crystal interfaces can be obtained. We observe that when comparing to monolithic glassy samples where a single shear band normally dominates, multiple shear bands appear in the BCC-amorphous composite samples. The plastic deformation initiates at the interfaces between nanocrystals and the glassy phase due to stress concentration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that shear along the bands results in growth of the nanocrystals.",

Lattice fringes (∼9Å) of this modulated phase do not show any discontinuity across the boundaries of regions of different contrasts of the moire-like fringes which is expected from domain boundaries. Instead, a periodic change in the spacing of the lattice fringes (phase slip region) expected from the superposition of split superlattice spots in forming the lattice image is observed.

In order to utilize effectively these materials for M/NEMS applications, understanding of their microscopic structure and physical (mechanical properties, in particular) become indispensable. The micro- and nanocrystalline diamond films were grown using hot-filament and microwave chemical vapor deposition techniques involving novel CH4 / [TMB for boron doping and H2S for sulfur incorporation] in high hydrogen dilution chemistry.  To investigate residual stress distribution and intermolecular forces at nanoscale, the films were characterized using Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy in terms of topography, force curves and force volume imaging. Traditional force curve measures the force felt by the tip as it approaches and retracts from a point on the sample surface, while force volume is an array of force curves over an extended range of sample area. Moreover, detailed microscale structural studies are able to demonstrate that the carbon bonding configuration (sp2 versus sp3 hybridization) and surface chemical termination in both the un-doped and doped diamond have a strong effect on nanoscale intermolecular forces. The preliminary information in the force volume measurement was decoupled from topographic data to offer new insights into the materials's",

Most reports in the literature indicate that at least 8 wt% carbon black filler is needed in order to achieve percolation. Our group recently reported that by manual mixing of ABS pellets and carbon black to create a segregated microstructure, percolation was achieved at an unprecedented low filler fraction of less than 0.01 wt% carbon black, a value which is comparable to or even better than that obtained using single wall carbon nanotubes as the filler.

Tilting and high resolution experiments are particularly difficult. A survey of several investigations of microstructures in ferromagnetic materials ranging from pure iron to commercial magnet materials is presented. The topics of these investigations include determination of Burgers vectors and interstitial/vacancy character for dislocation loops, cavity shape analyses, magnetic domain/microstructure correlations, and characterization of structures resulting from isotropic spinodal decomposition. Problems encountered during these studies as they relate to magnetic materials and the modifications to standard microscope operating procedures required to overcome these problems are presented. This discussion includes specimen requirements, specimen loading and insertion, and alignment corrections required during specimen tilting.",

W powders and gas-atomized 2024 Al aluminum powder were milled by ball milling with different milling parameters. The mixtures were consolidated by vacuum hot press under a pressure of 400MPa and then hot-extruded for a higher density. A T6 heat treatment was carried out for the samples, which consisted of solution treating at temperature 470-500, water quenching and artificial aging at 1900 for 8h. The microstructure of as-milled mixture powders and the composites were investigated by combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). The microstructure and its relationship with the mechanical properties of the composites were also investigated. The results show the milling-energy is a key factor for the processing of the composite. For the samples with high energy milling, Al atoms dissolved into W lattice gradually and finally formed a W solution after 6 hours milling, which can cause the a large amount of precipitation of WAl12, WAl5 in the following hot pressing process. With appropriate processing parameters, the tensile strength of the composite can reach 480 MPa.",

Variations in the coil radius and the film thickness had a minor effect on the modulus.

The main variable in this study was the nanofiller volume fraction while the particle size was either 15 nm or 100 nm. Local strain measurements indicated strain field localization in the vicinity of the nanofillers at strains that macroscopically fall in the linearly elastic regime. The matrix strains were as high as three times the applied far field strain at applied effective strains of ∼ 1%. At larger stresses the local strain fields evolved to maxima that were considerably higher than the applied strain, and they were affected by local particle density and distribution. In composites with the largest particle volume fraction, 5 vol.%, 100 nm fillers, neighboring particles located in small proximities behaved as single large particles and often resulted in matrix strain shielding thus decreasing the benefit of the large surface-to-volume ratio and the associated efficiency in load transfer. On the other hand the 15 nm fillers resulted in more uniformly distributed deformation compared to composites with 100 nm particles.",

We have developed an innovative bottom-up wafer scale fabrication method that combines nanopatterning and nanomaterials synthesis with traditional silicon micromachining technologies. We have achieved nano-micro integration through catalyst nanopatterning and registration at wafer scale and through effective nanocatalyst protection and release before and after microfabrication. Our wafer scale fabrication process has produced 244 carbon nanotube (CNT) probes per 4-inch silicon wafer with control over the CNT location, diameter, length, orientation, and crystalline morphology. CNT probes with diameters of 40-80 nm and lengths of 2-6 μm are found to be functional nano probes for atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. In this paper, we will address our nano probe design and fabrication considerations in detail. CNT tip locations and diameters are defined by e-beam lithography. CNT length, orientation, and crystalline quality are controlled by the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method. With effective catalyst protection schemes, this fabrication process is very similar to the conventional approach for fabricating wafer-scale silicon AFM probe tips. Process control is feasible and the overall yield is greatly improved. Our method and technology can be easily adapted to many other nanomaterials (nanotubes and nanowires) synthesis and processes for their rational design, fabrication, and integration in their applications.",

We have carried out a systematic study of the effect of multiple variables on the ac electrodeposition of copper nanowires using a fractional factorial design of experiment (FFDOE). This experiment led to the identification of template damage that occurs when continuous wave ac deposition conditions are employed, as well as to effective pulsed wave ac electrodeposition conditions.

The resistance to severe wear of the nanocomposites and the surface finish produced by a given grinding treatment are strikingly superior to those of pure alumina with the same grain size. We have explored the reasons for this by correlating a wide range of variations in the basic microstructure with the wear behaviour observed, including both the wear rate, and quantitative surface fractography of the worn surfaces. These improved properties of the nanocomposites are shown to be a consequence of a reduction in surface grain pullout by brittle fracture. In \u201cdilute\u201d nanocomposites (<10% SiC), this is due largely to a reduction in size of the individual pullouts. With 10% SiC nanoparticles, however, there is also evidence that the SiC directly suppresses the nucleation of cracking by plastic deformation of the surface. The origin of these effects will be discussed.",

Due to the fine scale structures observed, a technique with high spatial resolution is required. X-ray microanalysis in the analytical electron microscope (AEM) provides a sufficiently high spatial resolution to determine the composition of the various phases occurring in this system. In this study, the isothermal section at 1000°C was evaluated in a series of alloys having nickel contents greater than 65 wt%. In Ni3Al, Fe can substitute for either Ni or Al in the ordered face-centered cubic lattice having an Ll2 structure. However, in substituting Fe for Ni one finds that the solubility limit is quickly exceeded at about 5 wt% Fe with the resultant formation of a ordered body-centered cubic (B2) phase at high temperature, which transforms martensitically upon quenching. Also, in substituting Fe for Al, the solubility limit is exceeded at about 5 wt% Fe with the formation of a disordered, face-centered cubic Ni-rich terminal solid solution. Thus, a very narrow range of alloy compositions exist where Fe can substitute for Ni and Al and preserve a single-phase L12 structure. It was found that the maximum solubility of Fe in Ni3Al at 1000°C was 17.3 wtpercnt; at 70.3 wt% Ni and 12.4 wt% Al.",

The fabrication and application of 1-D ZnO nanostructures has attracted considerable interest in recent years. In this work, we produced single crystal nanowires of zinc oxide using a novel self-seeded growth using ultrasonic spray assisted chemical vapour deposition, in which a nanocrystalline seed layer was first deposited onto a glass substrate and the nanowires subsequently grown using a different precursor concentration and substrate temperature. The diameter of the nanowires is in the range of 20-80 nm and the length of the wires is as long as 10 μm. The single crystal nature of the nanowires was revealed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy. The formation of liquid droplets due to the reducing atmosphere and the higher temperature during the nanowire growth was found to be the key step of the ZnO nanowire formation.",

Polymeric lens materials like polycarbonate are usually treated with a scratch-resistant coating, which is commonly silica-based. The coating provides some protection, yet is not sufficient at resisting abrasion from blown sand in most commercial products. We demonstrate that silicone elastomeric coatings are superior to polycarbonate and silica glass at resisting damage by blown sand particles. Sand abrasion tests were conducted using a custom-built test apparatus that exposes the sample to 400 micron diameter quartz silica moving at 16.5 m/s (approx. 38 mph). Scanning electron microscopy revealed the presence of small cracks and pits in polycarbonate, coated polycarbonate, and silica glass after sand exposure.

The speed distribution of the nanoparticles has been determined by varying the time delay between the ablation and photoionization lasers. The results indicate that the most probable speed of the nanoparticles, after formation and a 25 mm drift in background Ar, is 100 m/s. Finally, there is a deviation of the size distribution from the log-normal distribution at small nanoparticle sizes. This is attributed to multiple ionization of the nanoparticles.

        "text": "Copper-based high strength nanofilamentary wires reinforced by bcc nanofilaments (Nb or Ta) are prepared by severe plastic deformation for the winding of high pulsed magnets. In-situ tensile tests under neutron beam were performed on a Cu/Nb nanocomposite composed of a multiscale Cu matrix embedding 554 Nb filaments with a diameter of 267 nm and spacing of 45 nm. The evolution of elastic strains for individual lattice plane in each phase and peak profiles in the copper matrix versus applied stress evidenced the co-deformation behavior with different elastic-plastic regimes and load sharing: the Cu matrix exhibits size effect in the finest channels while the Nb nanowhiskers remain elastic up to the macroscopic failure, with a strong load transfer from the copper matrix onto zones that are still in the elastic regime. Taking into account results from residual lattice strains also determined by neutron diffraction, the yield stress in the finest Cu channels is in agreement with calculations based on a single dislocation regime.",

        "text": "This paper reports on the refinement of a mechanical model for the load-deflection of multilayer membranes under uniform differential pressure and on its application to the experimental extraction of material parameters. Going beyond previous results, the analytical model takes into account the mechanics of multilayers and elastic supports covering all cases between rigidly clamped to simply supported structures and enables the straightforward assessment of stress profiles within the deformed structures. A comprehensive set of long membranes made of various multilayers of silicon nitride and oxide films are fabricated and characterized. The out-of-plane deflection profile under pressure load is monitored by means of a laser profilometer. The pressure is stepped up until fracture occurs. From the stress profiles in the membrane at fracture, the brittle material strength is analyzed using Weibull statistics. The bulge setup has been fully automated for the measurement of 80 membranes per wafer. This realizes, for the first time, the high throughput-acquisition of mechanical thin film data with convincing statistical control.",
