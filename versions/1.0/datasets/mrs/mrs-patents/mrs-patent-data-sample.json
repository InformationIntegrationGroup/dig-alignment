        "Description": "Description TECHNICAL FIELD This disclosure relates to processing materials with lasers. In particular, this disclosure relates to reducing laser beam back-reflection. BACKGROUND INFORMATION Generally, certain lasers may be sensitive to optical feedback from a laser beam reflected back to the laser from a work surface. Laser back-reflection may cause laser instability or damage to certain types of lasers. For example, fiber lasers are typically very sensitive to back-reflections from a work surface. If such reflections are not properly blocked, e.g., if there is a return path for such reflections to couple back into an output fiber, it is possible that both the output fiber and gain fibers may be damaged. Further, a seed laser may be damaged in a high-power master oscillator fiber amplifier device by reflected light that is amplified on its way back to the seed laser. In many laser processing systems, such as laser micromachining systems, it is therefore desirable to prevent such back-reflections from finding a path back into the output fiber. One solution for reducing or avoiding back-reflection in laser processing systems is to use a Faraday isolator, such as the isolators manufactured by Electro-Optics Technology, Inc. of Traverse City, Mich. Placing a Faraday isolator in the beam path after the laser source or output fiber blocks the back-reflections in free-space before the back-reflections return to the laser source or output fiber. For example, FIG. 1A is a block diagram of a typical laser system 101 including a laser source 102, an isolator 104, a beam delivery subsystem 106, and a scan head 108. The laser source 102 outputs a laser beam 103 received by the isolator 104. The isolator 104 allows the laser beam 103 to propagate in only one direction (e.g., as indicated by the arrow) through the beam delivery subsystem 106 and the scan head 108 to a desired location on a work surface 122. Thus, the isolator 104 blocks back-reflections from the work surface 122 through the scan head 108 and beam delivery subsystem 106 so as to prevent the back-reflections from reaching the laser source 102. For a linearly polarized laser system, the isolator 104 may be a polarization dependent isolator that includes an input polarizer (not shown), a Faraday rotator (not shown), and an output polarizer (not shown). Although shown following the laser source 102, the isolator 104 may be located at other locations along the beam path such as in the scan head 108 or within the beam delivery subsystem 106 (which may include, e.g., galvonometers, steering mirrors, lenses, and other optical elements). For a randomly polarized laser system, a polarization independent optical isolator may be used to prevent or reduce back-reflections. For example, FIG. 1B is a block diagram of a typical fiber laser processing system 100 that includes an output fiber 110, a collimator assembly 112, a Faraday isolator 114, and a focusing lens 116. The output fiber 110 directs a divergent laser beam 118 from a laser source (not shown) to the collimator assembly 112. The collimator assembly 112 collimates the divergent laser beam 118 to provide a collimated laser beam 120 to the Faraday isolator 114. The Faraday isolator 114 allows the transmission of light in only one direction. The collimated laser beam 120 transmits through the Faraday isolator 114 to the focusing lens 116, which focuses the beam onto a work surface 122. Because the incident laser beam's path is perpendicular to the work surface 122, a reflected laser beam 123 (shown in dashed lines) travels along the same path as that of the incident laser beam 120, in the reverse direction, through the focusing lens 116 to the Faraday isolator 114. The Faraday isolator 114, however, prevents the reflected laser beam from continuing along the reverse path back to the output fiber 110. If the laser beam 118 exiting the output fiber 110 is randomly polarized (as it often is), the Faraday isolator 114 is configured to be polarization insensitive. As shown in FIG. 1B, for example, a polarization insensitive Faraday isolator 114 may include an input birefringent wedge 124, a Faraday rotator 126, and an output birefringent wedge 128. While such isolators are commercially available, they are usually quite bulky (especially when configured for use with high-power beams), expensive, and add complexity to system alignment. Optical isolators may also be subject to thermal lensing effects in high power applications. Another approach to reduce or avoid back-reflections is to \u0093tilt\u0094 the entire beam delivery subsystem with respect to the work surface 122 so that the angle of incidence of the beam hitting the work surface is not 90 degrees. For example, FIG. 2 is a block diagram of another typical fiber laser processing system 200 having a tilted beam delivery subsystem (e.g., the output fiber 110, the collimator assembly 112, and the focusing lens 116) such that the path of the incident laser beam 120 is non-perpendicular to the work surface 122. As a consequence of tilting the beam delivery subsystem, the path of the reflected laser beam 123 from the work surface 122 is angularly separated from the path of the incident laser beam 120. A portion 210 of the reflected laser beam 123 may propagate back through the focusing lens 116 to the output fiber 110. However, the angular separation between the path of the incident laser beam 120 and the reflected laser beam 123 corresponds to a spatial separation which, in turn, substantially prevents the back-reflected beam 123 from coupling into the output fiber 110. The amount of spatial separation between the paths of the incident laser beam 120 and the reflected laser beam 123 is proportional to the focal length of the focusing lens 116 and the angular tilt (with respect to the work surface 122) of the beam delivery subsystem. Thus, the amount of spatial separation may be increased by increasing either the focal length, the angular tilt, or both the focal length and the angular tilt. As discussed below, while tilting the entire beam delivery subsystem with respect to the work surface 122 reduces back-reflections, it also tilts the focal plane with respect to the work surface 122. This leads to variations in the spot size and fluence at the work surface 122. These variations deteriorate process performance. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE Disclosed systems and methods reduce or prevent back-reflections in a laser processing system. In one embodiment, a system includes a laser source to generate an incident laser beam, a laser beam output to direct the incident laser beam toward a work surface along a beam path, and a spatial filter. The system further includes a beam expander to expand a diameter of the incident laser beam received through the spatial filter, and a scan lens to focus the expanded incident laser beam at a target location on a work surface. A reflected laser beam from the work surface returns through the scan lens to the beam expander, which reduces a diameter of the reflected beam and increases a divergence angle of the reflected laser beam. The spatial filter blocks a portion of the diverging reflected laser beam from passing through the aperture and returning to the laser beam output. In addition, or in another embodiment, the system may include focusing optics to focus the incident laser beam at an internal focus location along the beam path. The aperture of the spatial filter is located at the focus location. The focusing optics may comprise a Keplerian telescope. In addition, or in another embodiment, the system may include an f-theta lens. A central portion of a scan field of the f-theta lens may be designated as a dead zone of a predetermined size that is not used for laser processing of the work surface at the target location. In addition, or in another embodiment, the system may include a secondary beam positioner located between the laser beam output and the scan lens to scan the incident laser beam across the f-theta lens. The secondary beam positioner may change the path of the incident laser beam from a first position to a second position with respect to the scan lens. The secondary beam positioner may also control a scan angle of the incident laser beam at the scan lens so as to avoid the dead zone. In another embodiment, a method includes generating, with a laser, an incident laser beam, propagating the incident laser beam along a beam path toward a work surface, and expanding the incident laser beam from a first diameter to a second diameter along the beam path to achieve a smaller spot size at the work surface. The expansion results in decreasing the divergence of the incident laser beam. The method further includes receiving a reflected laser beam from the work surface in a reverse direction along the beam path, and reducing a size of the reflected laser beam from the second diameter to the first diameter. The reduction results in increasing the divergence angle and pointing angle of the reflected laser beam. The method further includes spatially filtering the diverging reflected laser beam to block at least a portion thereof from returning to the laser. Additional aspects and advantages will be apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Various systems and methods described herein reduce or prevent back-reflections from coupling into an output fiber of a laser processing system without using bulky and/or expensive isolators. In one embodiment, a focusing lens is placed in the beam path at an offset distance from the beam propagation axis so as to impart a non-vertical \u0093angle-of-attack\u0094 to the incident beam with respect to the work surface. This provides a spatial separation between incident and reflected beam paths without tilting the entire beam delivery subsystem with respect to the work surface. In one embodiment, an aperture further blocks the back-reflected laser beam from reaching the output fiber. In addition, or in another embodiment, a secondary beam positioner scans an incident laser beam across the focusing lens at an offset from the focusing lens's primary axis such that a scanning focal plane is substantially parallel to the work surface. Other embodiments disclosed herein effectively reduce back-reflections with low cost configurations. These embodiments include using a Keplerian telescope with a spatial filter at the internal focus, using predetermined portions of a scanning field of an f-theta lens, using a beam expander with a spatial filter, and/or combinations of the foregoing. Depending on the system configuration and the surface quality of the parts to be processed, these embodiments can effectively reduce or prevent back-reflection problems. Reference is now made to the figures in which like reference numerals refer to like elements. In the following description, numerous specific details are provided for a thorough understanding of the embodiments described herein. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that the embodiments can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, or materials. Further, in some cases, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail in order to avoid obscuring aspects of the embodiments. Furthermore, the described features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a laser processing system 300 that reduces or substantially prevents back-reflections according to one embodiment. The system 300 creates a spatial separation between the paths of an incident laser beam 120 and a reflected laser beam 123 (shown in dashed lines) by providing the incident laser beam 120 on a work surface 122 at an angle 308 other than 90 degrees. This change in the incident beam's \u0093angle of attack\u0094 308 is not, however, achieved by tilting the beam delivery assembly, as discussed above with respect to FIG. 2. The system 300 includes a fiber laser source (not shown) having an output fiber 110. In the examples described herein, fiber-based lasers are discussed because such lasers are sensitive to back-reflections. An artisan will recognize from the disclosure herein, however, that other types of lasers may also be sensitive to back-reflections and that any type of laser source may be used. Accordingly, other types of lasers may have laser beam outputs other than the output fiber 110 discussed herein. Indeed, a laser beam output may include a combination of various optical elements used to guide a laser beam's path before the beam is focused onto a work surface 122. The system 300 shown in FIG. 3 further includes a collimator assembly 112 and a focusing lens 116. The output fiber 110 directs a divergent laser beam 118 to the collimator assembly 112. The collimator assembly 112 collimates the divergent laser beam 118 such that the incident laser beam 120 on the focusing lens 116 is substantially collimated. The focusing lens 116 is a converging lens and is substantially symmetrical about its primary axis 310. The primary axis 310 of the focusing lens 116 is substantially perpendicular to the work surface 122. The incident laser beam 120 propagates along a first axis of propagation 312 from the collimator assembly 112 to the focusing lens 116. The first axis of propagation 312 is substantially parallel to the primary axis 310 of the focusing lens 116. There is, however, an offset 314 between the first axis of propagation 312 of the incident laser beam 120 and the primary axis 310 of the focusing lens 116. In other words, the (collimated) incident laser beam 120 does not hit the focusing lens 116 at the center of the lens 116 (as in the standard layouts shown in FIGS. 1B and 2). Rather, the incident laser beam 120 hits the focusing lens 116 at an offset 314 from the center of the lens 116. In one embodiment, the amount of offset 314 is greater than or equal to approximately one-half the diameter of the collimated incident laser beam 120. As discussed below, such an amount of offset 314 reduces or prevents overlap between the reflected laser beam 123 and the incident laser beam 120. The focusing lens 116 converges the incident laser beam 120 to a focused spot diameter on the work surface 122. As a result of the asymetric arrangement provided by the offset 314 between the first axis of propagation 312 of the incident laser beam 120 and the primary axis 310 of the focusing lens 116, the focusing lens 116 \u0093tilts\u0094 the incident laser beam 120 toward the primary axis 310 of the focusing lens 116. Thus, the focusing lens 116 changes the incident laser beam's path from the first axis of propagation 312 to a second axis of propagation 316 that intersects the work surface 122 at a non-perpendicular angle of attack 308. As a consequence of using the offset 314 to tilt the incident laser beam 120, the path of the reflected laser beam 123 is angularly separated from the path of the incident laser beam 120. Thus, after returning through the focusing lens 116, the reflected laser beam 123 travels along a third axis of propagation 318 that is spatially separated from the first axis of propagation 312 of the incident laser beam 120. In certain embodiments, an offset 320 between the first axis of propagation 312 corresponding to the incident laser beam 120 and the third axis of propagation 318 corresponding to the reflected laser beam 123 is configured such that the reflected laser beam 123 does not overlap with the incident laser beam 120. Thus, all or at least a substantial portion of the reflected laser beam 123 does not return through the collimator assembly 112 to the output fiber 110. As shown in FIG. 3, there may be situations in which a small portion 322 of the reflected laser beam 123 couples back into the output fiber 110. This may be undesirable in some embodiments. Thus, in certain such embodiments, a beam-stop is located anywhere between the output fiber 110 and the work surface 122 to prevent the remaining portion 322 of the reflected laser beam 123 from returning to the output fiber 110. Other devices may also be used as a beam-stop. For example, FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a laser processing system 400 that includes an aperture 410 that allows propagation of the incident laser beam 120 and blocks the propagation of the reflected laser beam 123 according to one embodiment. The aperture 410 has an opening that is substantially centered about the first axis of propagation of the incident laser beam 120. In one embodiment, the aperture 410 is greater than or substantially equal to the diameter of the (collimated) incident laser beam 120 so as to allow the incident laser beam 120 to pass from the collimator assembly 112 to the focusing lens 116. In one embodiment, the system 400 is configured such that the spatial separation 320 between the paths of the incident laser beam 120 and the reflected laser beam 123 (as determined by the focal length of the focusing lens 116 and the amount of offset 314 between the first axis of propagation 312 of the incident laser beam 120 and the primary axis 310 of the focusing lens 116) is in a range between approximately 1.5 times and 2.0 times the diameter of the collimated incident laser beam 120. Thus, by selecting the aperture 410 such that it has a comparable opening diameter to that of the incident laser beam 120, the likelihood of any significant back-reflections propagating to the output fiber 110 is substantially reduced. In addition, or in another embodiment, the focusing lens 116 and/or the beam-stop (e.g., the aperture 410 shown in FIG. 4) is combined with a secondary beam positioner that is inserted at a location between the beam-stop and the focusing lens 116. For example, FIG. 5 is a block diagram of a laser processing system 500 that includes a secondary beam positioner 510 to scan the incident laser beam 120 across the focusing lens 116 according to one embodiment. The secondary beam positioner 510 receives the collimated incident laser beam 120 (e.g., after it passes through the opening in the aperture 410) and steers the path of the incident laser beam 120 along the focusing lens 116 at an offset from the lens's primary axis 310. In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 5, the secondary positioning system 510 is configured to steer the incident laser beam 120 in two directions. A first galvanometer 512 adjusts a first mirror 514 to steer the incident laser beam 120 in a first direction, and a second galvanometer 516 adjusts a second mirror 518 to steer the incident laser beam 120 in a second direction. An artisan will recognize from the disclosure herein that other secondary beam positioner configurations may also be used. Although not shown in FIG. 5, the secondary beam positioner 510 may include a controller in certain embodiments comprising a processor for executing instructions stored in a computer readable medium for controlling the positions of the galvanometers 512, 516. FIGS. 5, 6A, and 6B illustrate one of the advantages of the embodiments disclosed herein, as compared to the standard \u0093tilted beam delivery assembly\u0094 approach shown in FIG. 2. Namely, in the disclosed embodiments, the beam path length from the focusing lens 116 to the point of impact on the work surface 122 remains substantially constant even as the secondary beam positioner 510 scans the incident laser beam 120 across the surface of the focusing lens 116. Referring to FIG. 5, as the secondary beam positioner 510 changes the path of the incident laser beam 120 from a first position 520 to a second position 522 with respect to the focusing lens 116, the length of the beam path 524 from the first position 520 to the work surface 122 remains substantially equal to the length of the beam path 526 from the second position 522 to the work surface 122. Note that in this example the path of the incident laser beam 120 from the first mirror 514, to the second mirror 518, through the second position 522 on the focusing lens 116, and to the work surface 122 is shown with a dashed line. FIGS. 6A and 6B are block diagrams of respective laser processing systems that compare focal planes when using a secondary beam positioner 510 according to certain embodiments. FIG. 6A shows the beam positioner 510 used in a system 600 having a tilted beam delivery subsystem. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 6A, the primary axis 310 of the focusing lens 116 is non-perpendicular to the work surface 122. Thus, as the secondary beam positioner 510 scans the incident laser beam 120 through the primary axis 310 and other points along the focusing lens 116, the focal plane 610 shifts. The focal plane 610 shown in FIG. 6A is substantially perpendicular to the \u0093tilted\u0094 primary axis 310 of the focusing lens 116. The ensuing variation in work surface spot size and fluence may deteriorate process performance. This problem is reduced or avoided by the embodiments disclosed herein. For example, FIG. 6B illustrates a simplified version of the system 500 shown in FIG. 5, in which the primary axis 310 of the focusing lens 116 is substantially perpendicular to the work surface 122. Thus, as the secondary beam positioner 510 scans the incident laser beam 120 at one or more offsets along the focusing lens 116, the focal plane 612 remains substantially parallel to the work surface 122. The embodiments discussed above are much simpler and cheaper to implement, as compared to the standard approach of inserting a polarization insensitive Faraday isolator 114 (see FIG. 1B) into the beam path. The described embodiments are also superior to the beam delivery assembly tilting approach (see FIG. 2) because they provide a constant beam path length from the focusing lens 116 to the work surface 122, even in the presence of a secondary beam positioner 510 that scans the incident laser beam 120 across the surface of the focusing lens 116. The embodiments shown in FIGS. 3, 4, 5 and 6B may be easily implemented when the laser beam 120 is parallel to the primary axis 310 of the focusing lens 116. It may become more difficult to accurately direct the focused laser beam 120 to desired target locations on the work surface 122, however, as the secondary beam positioner 510 deflects the laser beam 120 at larger angles with respect to the primary axis 310 of the focusing lens 116, as shown by dashed lines of deflected laser beam 120\u2032 in FIG. 6B. In other words, it may be easier to implement the embodiments shown in FIGS. 3, 4, 5 and 6B for small scan fields of the focusing lens 116 than it is to implement it for relatively larger scan fields. The embodiments discussed below are more easily implemented for reducing or preventing back-reflections for relatively larger scan fields, as compared to the embodiments shown in FIGS. 3, 4, 5 and 6B. FIGS. 7A and 7B are block diagrams of laser processing systems including a Keplerian telescope 700 to reduce or substantially prevent back-reflections according to certain embodiments. For illustrative purposes in FIGS. 7A and 7B, a laser beam 710 from a laser output 712 (e.g., from the output fiber 110 and/or the collimator assembly 112 in FIG. 3) is shown with solid lines, and scatter or reflected laser beams 714 from a work surface (e.g., the work surface 122 in FIG. 3) passing back through a scan head 716 (e.g., at a higher angles) are shown as dashed lines. Although not shown, skilled persons will recognize from the disclosure herein that a portion of the reflections will also pass back directly along the axis of the laser beam 710 (e.g., at lower angles). The Keplerian telescope 700 includes a first lens 718 and a second lens 720. The lenses 718, 720 may each comprise, for example, a singlet plano-convex lens. The first lens 718 focuses the collimated laser beam 710 received from the laser output 712 at an internal focus location 722. The second lens 720 recollimates the laser beam 710 and provides it to the scan head 716. The second lens 720 also receives the reflected laser beams 714 as it propagates back through the scan head 716 and focuses the reflected laser beams 714 at the internal focus location 722. In FIG. 7A, the reflected laser beams 714 pass back through the first lens 718 to the laser output 712. The embodiment shown in FIG. 7B, however, includes a spatial filter 724 located at the internal focus location 722 of the Keplerian telescope 700 to block a substantial portion of the (e.g., higher angle) reflected laser beams 714. In one embodiment, the spatial filter 724 may be a pinhole aperture. In another embodiment, the spatial filter 724 may be a cone-shaped filter or other device configured to trap the higher angle reflected laser beams 714. Depending on the power level in the higher angle reflected laser beams 714, the spatial filter 724 may be water cooled in certain embodiments. The aperture diameter of the spatial filter 724 may be determined by the input diameter of the laser beam 710 (e.g., at the laser output 712) and f1 of the Keplerian telescope 700, where f1 is the focal length of the first lens 718. The reflected laser beams 714 with slight angle change due to work surface flatness and scatter due to the roughness are blocked by the spatial filter 724. For example, if the laser beam 710 from the laser output 712 is about 2 mm, and f1=f2=200 mm (where f2 is the focal length of the second lens 720), the focused beam size at the internal focus location 722 is about 160 \u03bcm. In this example, using an aperture size of about 320 \u03bcm in the spatial filter 724 blocks the reflected beams 714 with incident angles greater than about 0.05 degrees. While a relatively small amount of scatter may return to the laser output 712 through the aperture along the axis of the laser beam 710, the laser continues to function normally and without damage in many applications of this embodiment where the power of the reflected laser beam at the laser is below a threshold level for the particular laser. In one embodiment, the scan head 716 shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B includes a telecentric lens. In other embodiments, an f-theta lens is used. When a telecentric scan lens is not required for a particular application, an f-theta lens may be used for a larger area scan and to take advantage of the telecentric angle error, which may be about 10 degrees at the edge of the field. FIG. 8 is a block diagram of an f-theta lens 810 used according to certain embodiments. For illustrative purposes, an input ray 812 is shown at a scan angle \u03b8 with respect to an optical axis 814 of the f-theta lens. When the scan angle \u03b8=0 (e.g., the input ray 812 is parallel to the optical axis 814), an output ray 816 propagates parallel to the optical axis 814 and is reflected by a work surface 122 back through the f-theta lens 810. As the scan angle \u03b8 increases, however, the laser beam exits the f-theta lens 810 at a known angle relative to the scan angle \u03b8, as illustrated by output ray 818 that has an angle of incidence 820 with the work surface 122. In some embodiments, the angle of incidence 820 may be as high as 10 degrees to 12 degrees or higher. Thus, depending on the angle of incidence 820, a reflected ray 822 may not return through the f-theta lens 810. In certain embodiments, a \u0093dead zone\u0094 is defined in the center of the scan field of the f-theta lens 810 corresponding to an angle of incidence 820 that is close to zero. For example, FIG. 9 schematically illustrates a scan field 910 of the f-theta lens 810 shown in FIG. 8 according to one embodiment. The scan field 910 includes a predetermined portion or dead zone 912 that is not used for laser processing of targets on the work surface 122 shown in FIG. 8. In other words, because laser beam reflections from the dead zone 912 cause excessive interference with, or damage to, the laser, the scan angle \u03b8 of the laser beam into the f-theta lens 810 is controlled such that the laser beam is not incident on the work surface 122 within the dead zone 912 of the scan field 910. For example, the circular scan field 910 shown in FIG. 9 may have a diameter of about 20 mm and the dead zone 912 may have a diameter of about 5 mm to avoid excessive reflections from returning to the laser (in certain embodiments, without the need for a spatial filter). FIGS. 10A and 10B are block diagrams of laser processing systems 1000 including a beam expander 1010 used with a spatial filter 724 to reduce or avoid back-reflections according to certain embodiments. The respective systems 1000 shown in FIGS. 10A and 10B each include a laser source 1012 to provide a collimated laser beam 1014 having a first beam diameter. The laser source 1012 may include the output fiber 110 and/or the collimator assembly 112 shown in FIG. 3. The laser beam 1014 passes through the aperture in the spatial filter 724 to the beam expander 1010. The beam expander 1010 increases the size of the laser beam 1014 from the first beam diameter to a second beam diameter. The second beam diameter may be two times (2\u00d7), three times (3\u00d7), five times (5\u00d7), or another size larger than the first beam diameter, depending on the desired spot size used for laser processing the work surface 122. The beam expander 1010 may comprise, for example, a Keplerian or Galilean beam expander. The beam expander 1010 provides a collimated laser beam 1016 having the second beam diameter to a scan head 716 for focusing the laser beam at a target location on the work surface 122. As discussed above, the scan head 716 may include a telecentric lens or an f-theta lens, such as the f-theta lens 810 shown in FIG. 8. In certain embodiments, the system 1000 may also include the secondary beam positioner 510 shown in FIG. 5 to scan the laser beam 1016 across the f-theta lens 810 at a selected scan angle \u03b8 so as to avoid the dead zone 912 of the scan field 910. In certain embodiments, the size and/or location of the dead zone 912 is based on a threshold power level of a portion of reflected light allowed to return to the laser source 1012 without interfering with its operation or causing damage thereto. While the laser beams 1014, 1016 into and out of the beam expander 1010 are described as being collimated, each laser beam 1014, 1016 has some divergence (not shown). The beam expander 1010 changes the beam diameter, the beam divergence angle, and the pointing angle. The beam divergence angle and the pointing angle are inverse proportional to the magnification of the beam size depending upon the diameters of the input and output laser beams according to: \u03b4(in)/\u03b4(out)=D(out)/D(in), where \u03b4(in) is the input beam divergence angle, \u03b4(out) is the output beam divergence angle, D(out) is the output beam diameter, and D(in) is the input beam diameter. When the output beam diameter D(out) increases, the output beam divergence angle \u03b4(out) decreases, and vice versa. Thus, although not shown in FIGS. 10A and 10B, the laser beam 1016 has a decreased divergence as compared to that of the laser beam 1014. At least a portion of a reflected laser beam 1018 (shown with a dashed line) from the work surface 122 returns through the scan head 716 to the beam expander 1010. In the reverse direction, the beam expander 1010 reduces the size of the reflected laser beam 1018, e.g., from about the second diameter to about the first diameter and increases the divergence. Thus, a portion of the reflected laser beam 1020 exits the beam expander 1010 at about the first beam diameter and has a proportionally increased beam divergence angle. Although not necessarily shown to scale, the divergence of the reflected laser beam 1020 is represented in FIGS. 10A and 10B. If, for example, a 2\u00d7 expander is used, the reflected laser beam 1020 will have a 2\u00d7 decrease in beam diameter, a 2\u00d7 increase in beam divergence angle, and a 2\u00d7 increase in pointing angle as compared to those of the reflected beam 1018 entering the beam expander 1010 in the reverse direction. Accordingly, by increasing the divergence, the beam expander 1010 reduces the portion of the reflected laser beam 1020 that passes back through the aperture of the spatial filter 724. In FIG. 10B, the system 1000 includes a Keplerian telescope 700 with the spatial filter 724 located at the internal focus location 722, as discussed above with respect to FIG. 7B. Thus, the aperture in the spatial filter 724 shown in FIG. 10B may be smaller than the aperture in the spatial filter 724 shown in FIG. 10A. Accordingly, the spatial filter 724 in FIG. 10B blocks more of the reflected laser beam 1020 than that of FIG. 10A. Further reductions in the amount of the reflected laser beam 1020 passing through the spatial filter 724 in FIGS. 10A and 10B may be made by including one or more of the other embodiments described herein (such as including within the scan head 716 the f-theta lens 810 with the predetermined dead zone 912 in the scan field 910, as discussed above with respect to FIGS. 8 and 9). While the systems and methods described herein address back-reflection problems associated with a fiber laser based system, those skilled in the art will recognize that the approach is just as valid for systems that utilize other types of lasers as well. It will be understood by those having skill in the art that many changes may be made to the details of the above-described embodiments without departing from the underlying principles of the invention. The scope of the present invention should, therefore, be determined only by the following claims.",

Erikson, Winchester, Mass, assignor to Polaroid Corporation, Cambridge, Mass., a corporation of Delaware Filed Sept. 21, 1964, Ser. No. 397,938 9 Claims. (Cl. 250-68) The present invention relates to X-ray photography, and more specifically to film-holding cassettes especially useful in X-ray crystallography. A common technique used in making X-ray exposures for various purposes is known as back-reflection Laue photography. One useful application of this technique, for example, is the determination of crystal structures and orientation. The X-ray beam is directed through an opening, usually at the center of the film and the cassette, to impinge upon the crystal, positioned on the opposite side of the film and cassette from the X-ray tube. At least a portion of the X-rays are reflected by the crystal back upon the film in a pattern indicative of the structure and orientation of the crystal. After exposure in this manner, the film is removed from the cassette and developed in the usual way. It is then necessary to reconstruct the portion of the film which was removed so that precision measurements of the pattern may be taken from a reference position, normally the axis of the X-ray beam. It is a principal object of the invention to provide novel film-holding means which permit X-ray exposures to be made, processed and analyzed with speed, accuracy and simplicity. A further object is to provide apparatus for holding a photosensitive sheet during exposure to X-rays wherein the barrier against visible light may be flexible and the X-rays may pass through both the sheet and light barrier when making so-called back-reflection Laue exposures. Another object is to provide apparatus for holding conventional photographic film packets of a type presently in commercial use which permits X-ray exposures, including back Laue exposures, to be made on a photosensitive portion of the packet. A still further object is to provide a novel combination of photosensitive film and film-holding apparatus wherein back Laue exposures may be made without the necessity of making a hole in the film or the barrier which protects the film from visible light. Still another object is to provide a novel X-ray cassette having a thin, flexible light barrier which attenuates X-rays passing therethrough by a minimal amount and including means for holding the film flat against the intensifying screen of the cassette. Other objects of the invention will in part be obvious and will in part appear hereinafter. The invention accordingly comprises the apparatus possessing the construction, combination of elements and arrangement of parts which are exemplified in the following detailed disclosure, and the scope of the application of which will be indicated in the claims. For a fuller understanding of the nature and objects of the invention, reference should be had to the following detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein: FIGURE 1 is an exploded perspective view of one embodiment of the apparatus of the invention, with portions broken away; FIG. 2 is a perspective view of the apparatus of FIG- URE 1 showing certain movable elements in a first position; 3,330,953 Patented July 11, 1967 FIG. 3 is an enlarged, fragmentary, side elevational view in section on the line 33 of FIG. 2; FIG. 4 is a perspective view, as in FIG. 2, showing the movable elements in a second position; FIG. 5 is a side elevational view, as in FIG. 3, in section on the line 55 of FIG. 4; FIGS. 68 are a series of side elevational views in section through the longitudinal center of the apparatus, illustrating a series of steps in preparing for an exposure; FIG. 9 is a perspective view of one element of the apparatus of FIGURE 1 including a modification according to a second embodiment of the invention; FIG. 10 is a side elevational view in section on the line 1010 of FIG. 9; FIG. 11 is a perspective view of another element of the apparatus of FIGURE 1 modified according to the aforesaid second embodiment; FIG. 12 is aside elevational view in section on the line 12-12 of FIG. 11; and FIG. 13 is a side sectional view, as in FIG. 12, showing the elements in the film-retaining position. One of the elements of the invention, in the embodiments described herein, is a previously known item of photographic equipment presently manufactured by P0- laroid Corporation, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and known as the Land 4 x 5 Film Holder No. 500. This film holder may be utilized to position for exposure, and subsequently assist in the development of a film assemblage in the form of a packet including a lig-httight envelope for enclosing the photosensitive sheet. Film packets of the type described are known as self developing film packets, a specific example being those manufactured by Polaroid Corporation and known as Land Film Packets, Type 52, 53, 57, 510, etc. Both the film holder and packets are described in 'detail in US. Patent No. 2,933,993 of Albert J. Bachelder et al., issued April 26, 1960. Although not limited to employment with film holders and packets of this specific type, the present invention will be so de scribed since the technique of rapid exposure, development and analysis with which the invention is concerned is best achieved through the use of such. It is therefore to be understood that the invention may be practised with any suitable photosensitive medium with the basic filmholding means comprising a previously known cut film holder. ' Accordingly, film holder 10, shown fragmentarily in FIGS. 1, 2, 4 and 68, comprises basically a film holder of the type described in the aforementioned Patent No. 2,933,993, with certain modifications described hereinafter which may be incorporated after manufacture of the holder in the usual manner. Film holder 10 includes upper and lower body portions 12 and 14, respectively, which may be retained in engagement by any suitable means such as clamps 16 which engage marginal edges of the two body portions. Suitable spacer means are included to maintain a space between the interior opposing surfaces of body portions 12 and 1 as may be best seen in FIGS. 68, thereby permitting insertion of the film packet described hereinafter between the body portions. Upper body portion 12 includes a rectangular opening 18 which forms the exposure opening for a photosensitive film positioned within holder 10, as will appear more fully hereinafter. A rectangular intensifying screen 20 is inserted into a recess which may be formed in lower body portion 14 so that the surface of the screen seen in FIG- URE 1 is flush with the interior surface of body pora tion 14. A circular opening 22 extends through body portion 14 and intensifying screen 20 of holder 10. Bushing 24, seen in FIGS. 6-8, encircles opening 22 and is fixedly secured to body portion 14 by any appropriate fastening means. Light seal 26 is inserted between bushing 24 and body portion 14 and preferably comprises a relatively thin material opaque to visible light and transparent to X-rays. The thickness and consistency of the material of light seal 26 should be such that an X-ray beam passing therethrough is not significantly attenuated by the light seal. Black acetate plastic in the order of 0.005\" thick has been found suitable for this purpose. The addition of intensifying screen 20, opening 22, bushing 24, and light seal 26, and the repositioning of an internal linkage and stop mechanism (not shown, but pointed out in more detail hereinafter) are the only alterations which are performed on the standard Land 4 x 5 Film Holder No. 500, in forming film holder of the present embodiment of this invention. Although shown somewhat diagrammatically and fragmentarily in the present drawings, it is again pointed out that a complete description of the Land 4 x 5 Film Holder No. 500 is to be found in US. Patent No. 2,933,993. Additional descriptive material relating to this film holder and the film assemblage or packet intended for use therein may be found in US. Patent No. 3,119,317 of Dexter P. Cooper Jr., et al. issued January 28, 1964, wherein the subject holder and film packet are described in combination with other apparatus in a further modification of the method of use of the holder and film packet. Fixedly attached to film holder 10 by means of rivets 28 is frame 30, having a rectangular opening 32, conforming substantially in size to and positioned congruently with opening 18, bounded by surface 34. U-shaped slide member 36 is seated with its lower surface 38 in sliding contact with surface 34 of frame 30. The upper portion of slide member 36 includes cam surfaces 40 disposed at an angle to the direction of sliding movement of slide member 36 upon surface 34. Retaining frame 42 includes vertically disposed rectangular wall 44 and horizontally disposed wall 46 extending outwardly from the upper edge of Wall 44. Wall 46 includes elongated openings 48, in a portion of each of which are rotatably mounted small rollers 50. The outside dimensions of vertically disposed Wall 44 are such that it is adapted to extend through opening 32 of frame and exposure opening 18 of film holder 10. The outside dimensions of horizontally disposed wall 46 are such that retaining element 42 will fit within the vertically disposed walls of frame 30, as may be seen in FIGS. 6-8. Light barrier 51 is made of a material with characteristics similar to light barrier 26; for this application a .004\" thick triacetate sheet is well suited. Barrier 51 is secured to element 42 to extend across and block the rectangular opening defined by vertically disposed wall 44. Cover element 52 includes interior vertically disposed side wall 54, and exterior-vertically disposed side Wall 56, connected by horizontally disposed wall 58 to form an element of U-shaped cross section. Cover element 52 is arranged to lie in covering relationship to retaining element 42 to prevent entry of light into holder 10 between the portion of holder 10 bounding exposure opening 18 and wall 44 of element 42. Wall 54 of the cover element defines a central opening in registration with the exposure opening in the film holder and that defined by wall 44 of element 42. Positioned between vertically disposed walls 54 and 56 are springs 60, one of which may be seen in FIGURE 1 where a fragment of exterior, vertically disposed wall 56 has been cut away. Spring seats 62 are formed in horizontally disposed wall 46 of retaining element 42. The spring seats comprise openings slightly larger than the outside diameter of springs 60 extending through only a portion of the thickness of wall 46. a When the apparatus of FIGURE 1 is assembled stem 64, which is fixedly attached to slide element 36, extends through opening 66 in frame 30 and through cutaway portion 68 of cover element 52. Knob 70 is then aflixed to the end of stem 64, thereby allowing reciprocal sliding movement of sliding element 36 upon surface 34 of frame 30. In FIG.2 the elements are shown assembled with cover element 52 removed and knob moved outwardly from the apparatus, whereby slide element 36 is moved to the right as seen in this figure. An enlarged side sectional view of a portion of the apparatus is shown in FIG. 3 with the elements in the position of FIG. 2, i.e., with slide element 36 moved toward the right. Here it may be seen that roller 50 of retaining element 42 is positioned adjacent the lower end of cam surface 40. The upper portion of cam surface 40, which terminates in conjunction with horizontally disposed surface 72, extends through an enlarged portion of elongated opening 48. Movement of knob 70 from the position shown in FIG. 2 to that shown in FIG. 4 moves slide 36 along surface 34 from the FIG. 3 to the FIG. 5 position. Element 42 is restrained against horizontal movement by the rather close fit of wall 46 within frame 30. Thus, as slide 36 is moved toward the left, as seen in FIGS. 3 and 5, roller 50 rides up cam surface 40 and element 42 is moved vertically against the force of springs 60. After movement of slide 36 to the FIG. 5 position, roller 50 rests on horizontal surface 72 of the slide, thus maintaining margin retaining element 42 in the upper position. Movement of knob 70 back to the FIG. 2 position causes movement of slide 36 back to the right and allows element 42 to return to the lower position under the force exerted by springs 60. The operation of the above-described embodiment of the apparatus in conjunction with a film packet is illustrated in the side sectional views of FIGS. 68. The film packet, indicated generally by reference numeral 75, may comprise a Polaroid Land Series 50 film packet, manufactured by Polaroid Corporation, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Such packets include a single flexible sheet serving as a support for a photosensitive layer, indicated in the present drawings by the reference numeral 76, sometimes referred to hereinafter as the negative. Second sheet 78 is adapted to receive, upon proper chemical treatment, a positive transfer image from a developed photographic image formed in the photosensitive portion of sheet 76. Sheets 76 and 78 are initially arranged within opaque envelope 80 which protects the photosensitive portion from actinic light prior to exposure and which is slightly wider than sheets 76 and 78 to permit relative slidable movement of the sheets within the envelope. Such film packets also normally include an elongated liquid-carrying container holding a supply of a processing fluid adapted to be released from the container and spread between sheets 76 and 78 to effect development of a latent image formed in the photosensitive portion of sheet 76 and formation of a positive transfer image in sheet 7 8. Release of the processing fluid from the container and spreading it between the sheets to be processed is normally accomplished by manually advancing the film packet through a pair of pressure rolls which cause the container to rupture and the fluid to be released therefrom. The container, pressure rolls, etc., are not shown in the present drawings, being well known in the art and presently in wide commercial use. When loading film packet 75 into the apparatus, knob 70 is moved to the left or inward position, as shown in FIG. 6, whereby retaining element 42 is in the upper position. The packet is inserted with the photosensitive surface of sheet 76 facing intensifying screen 20. Once the packet has been inserted within the lighttight interior of holder 10, sheet 78 and envelope 80 may be partially Withdrawn to place negative 76 in position for exposure without interference from envelope 80 and sheet 78. This is accomplished, according to conventional construction of such film packets and holders, by attaching a clip to the right hand end (as shown in FIGS. 6-8) of negative 76. This end of envelope 80 is left open, but the clip is arranged to extend around the open end and provide a light shield for maintaining the film packet in a lighttight condition. When the packet has been fully inserted in the holder, as in FIG. 6, the clip is engaged by suitable detents or other such engagement means Within holder 10. Envelope 80, to which sheet 78 is attached, may then be withdrawn toward the left to the position shown in FIG. 7. Negative 76 is retained in the position of FIG. 6 since it is attached to the clip which is engaged by the detent means within the holder. Suitable stop means may be provided for limiting the extent of withdrawal of envelope 80 and sheet 78. The stop means provided in the usual commercial embodiment of the film holder and packet comprise a movable, mechanical stop member in the holder and an element such as a piece of tape or cardboard on the outside of the envelope. The stop member is arranged to allow sliding insertion of the packet into the holder, but upon withdrawal of the envelope, with the clip and negative being held by the aforementioned detent means, the element thereon engages the stop means and prevents complete withdrawal of the envelope from the holder. After exposure and reinsertion of the envelope, the stop member is moved, through a linkage arrangement, out of the path of movement of the element on the envelope to allow complete withdrawal thereof from the holder. Since the film packet is inserted in the holder of the present invention with the photosensitive surface facing the intensifying screen, which is the reverse of the normal insertion for ordinary 4 x 5 photography in the usual commercial embodiment, either the stop mechanism in the holder or the element on the envelope must be reversed to the opposite side for proper operation. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the stop member and linkage arrangement is moved to the opposite side of the holder to allow operation with commercially available film packets without modification thereof. The arrangement of the stop member on the opposite side of the holder is a simple mechanical expedient, well within the skill of the ordinary mechanic. The clip, detent means, stop means, etc., are not shown in the present drawings, being well known in the art, a full description being found in aforementioned US. Patent No. 2,933,993. With the elements in the position of FIG. 7, negative 76 is in position for exposure with its photosensitive surface facing intensifying screen 20. The interior of holder 10 is maintained in a lighttight condition by cover 52 and light barriers 26 and 51. It is essential that during exposure the negative be held with its photosensitive surface flat and in continuous contact with the opposing surface of the intensifying screen. This is accomplished according to the present embodiment of the invention by moving knob 70 to the right or outward position, as shown in FIG. 8. This moves slide 36 toward the right and allows rollers 50 to move down cam surfaces 40 to the lower end thereof, as shown in FIG. 3. Springs 60 exert the necessary force on margin retaining element 42 for moving the latter to the position of FIG. 8. In this position the edges of vertically disposed side walls 44 of element 42 will engage negative 76 around the entire periphery of exposure opening 18, through which walls 44 extend. The clearance between rollers 50 and the lower ends of cam surfaces 40, as shown in FIG. 3, is provided to insure complete and continuous contact of the lower edges of walls 44 with negative 76. Light barrier 51, although preferably made of a thin, flexible sheet material, is stretched taut in the opening defined by side walls 44 and is also in contact with the negative. Thus, retaining element 42 and light barrier 51 act cooperatively to maintain the apparatus in a lighttight condition and to hold the negative flat against the intensifying screen during exposure. With the elements in the position of FIG. 8 an X-ray beam may be directed through opening 22 to strike a crystal or other such object positioned on the opposite side of holder 10. The beam will pass through light barrier 26, negative 76, light barrier 51, strike the crystal and be reflected back through light barrier 51 and the negative 76 to impinge upon intensifying screen 20. The X-rays\" striking the screen cause the latter to emit light in the areas of impingement, thus exposing the adjacent photosensi- 3 tive surface of the negative. Development of the resulting latent image reveals the structure or orientation of the crystal from which the X-ray beam has been reflected. After exposure in the above-described manner, knob is again moved to the left or inward position, returning the elements to the position of FIG. 7. Retaining element 42 is now out of engagement with negative 76 so that envelope 80 may be reinserted over the negative with second sheet 78 in superposition therewith. The detents or other such holding means may then be released from the clip, leaving film packet free to be drawn out of holder 10 and through appropriate pressure-applying means to effect release and spreading of the processing fluid and development of the exposed negative. FIGS. 9-13 illustrate an alternate embodiment of the invention. The basic structure of holder 10, frame 30, slide 36, retaining element 42 and cover 52 remain the same as in the previously described embodiment and the same reference numerals are used to denote like parts in the present embodiment. Cover 52, as shown in FIGS. 9 and 10, includes light barrier 82 extending across the central opening. This barrier may be used in either the present or the previous embodiment in place of or in addition to light barrier 51. Retaining element 42 includes a sealed, airtight bag 84 secured thereto in covering relation to the central opening defined by side walls 44. Bag 84 may conveniently be made of a material which may be laminated to itself at the edges to form an airtight space between wall 86, which is stretched taut across the opening, and wall 88. A quantity of air which is allowed to remain within bag 84 when the latter is sealed maintains wall 88 in spaced relation to wall 86. Retaining element 42 is moved to engage and disengage negative 76 as in the previous embodiment. In FIG. 12 bag 84 is shown in the free, or undistorted position which it assumes when retaining element 42 is in the upper position (as in FIGS. 6 and 7) out of contact with negative 76. FIG. 13 shows retaining element 42 in the lower position with wall 88 in contact with negative 76, thus compressing the bag and distorting wall 86 somewhat out of its initial plane. The positive air pressure within bag 84, produced by compressing the latter against negative 76, urges wall 88 into more firm contact with the negative over the entire area subject to exposure. Bag 84 is constructed of a material such as thin polyethylene or acetate plastic so as to allow passage of the X-ray beam therethrough with a minimum of dispersion. Bag 84 may also be transparent to visible light if opaque light barrier 82 is used, or one of the walls of the bag may be apaque to visible light and provide the necessary means for maintaining light tightness in the interior of holder 10 without using barrier 82. It may thus be seen that the apparatus of the invention provides means for rapidly and precisely exposing and processing film in X-ray crystallography applications, for example, while using basic photographic apparatus and film packets which are presently comercially available. Back Laue exposures may be effected without the necessity of cuting a hole in the negative or providing the other special apparatus. Means are also provided for maintaining the cassette in a lighttight condition and for holding the negative in intimate contact with the intensifyng during exposure.

MILLER ATT'Y United States Patent CASSETTE AND HOLDER THEREFOR FOR BACK 5 REFLECTION CAMERAS Harold C. Miller, Chicago, 111., assignor to'Super-Cut, Inc., Chicago, 111., a' corporation of Illinois Application J'une6,.1'958', Serial No. 740,494 11 Claims; (Cl. 250-68) The present invention relates to cassettes for X-r'ay 15 films and more particularly to a novelform of cassette designed for use in connection with back reflection X-ray methods of crystal orientation wherein a photographic record of the back reflection pattern of a diamond or other crystal is made preparatory to identification and reading of the pattern in terms of error angles by comparison with a Greninger chart so that the errors may be set into a goniometer which will bring the diamond to any desired orientation for transfer of the diamond from the temporary goniometer dop to a tool nib. Such a method of crystal orientation has been shown and described in my'copending application Serial No. 669,492, filed July 2, 1957 for Method of and Apparatus for Mounting Diamonds in Tool Shanks and Other Holders and reference may be had to such application for a full disclosure of the method and consequently for a better understanding of the use to which the present invention may be put. Briefly, it has long been recognized that a diamond offers varying resistance to abrasion, depending upon the particular relationship between the direction of abrasion across the compacting face of the stone and the crystallographic axes of the stone. Where a di'amondis to perform useful work, for example, in dressing the peripheral or other surface of a grinding wheel, or where a diamond is'to be worked upon, for example, where it is to be sawed into individual slabs, it is highly advantageous. that the diamond be mounted in the tool shank or holder with its crystallographic axes so disposed relative to the axis of the tool shank that normal feeding of the shank will bring the stone into traversing register with the surface undergoing dressing so that abrasion will take place in a direction wherein the diamond is highly resistant to abrasion and cleavage. For accurate mounting of the diamond in the tool shank by the photographic method disclosed in my above-mentioned copending application, the deviation of an approximately oriented diamond on a temporary dop is ascertained by X-ray diifra'ction procedure and orientation of the temporary dop and its affixed diamond relative to a second dop is effected on the basis of such ascertained deviation, after which mechanical transfer of the diamond from the first dop to the second dop is effected while maintaining the two dops thus relatively oriented. Thereafter, a second mechanical transfer of the diamond from the second dop to a final mount while automatically preserving the corrected orientation of the stone by certain fiducial alignment procedure is carried out so that the finally mounted diamond will have the desired crystallographic orientation relative to the axis of the mount, Such procedure involves the use of special X-ray equipment whereby a photographic record of the back reflection pattern of the diamond may be obtained. This-equipment consists essentially of X-ray machine including a forwardly extending collimator tube, the forwardzend of which is'i'n register with a central openi-ng provided in\" the X-ray film; The X-rays issuing from the collimator tube pass through the central opening of ice the film, strike the diamond which is positioned forwardly of the film in alignment with the collimatortube, and are reflected backwardly to: the film for exposure purposes. The film is enclosed in a filmholder'or cassette, together with the usual intensifying screen or screens on one'or both sides of the film, and the cassette andthe screen or screens are provided with central openings in\" register with the opening in the film so that the X-rays issuing from the collimator tube may pass completely through the cassette and film unobstruetedly. Heretofore, film and film holders of this general character have been more or less permanently associated each with the other in that, in order to mount the film-containing cassette in accurate register with the collimator tube and diamond, the cassette has been fixedly attached to a cassette support which is removahlyapplied to a guide rail or other support associated with either the X-ray machine or thegoniometer or other diamond supporting structure, or both. The film holder or cassette, together with the support therefor are generally referred to as the camera, and heretofore, it has been the practice after making each-exposure to remove the entire camera from the Xrayma? chine and carry the same to the dark room, after which the cassette is removed from the support, opened, thefilm removed and developed. During the time that the film is undergoing development, a new film may be inserted into the cassette, the cassette closed andsecured to the holder, and the camera returned to the X-ray machine and mount ed thereon preparatory to making. the next exposure. Such individual processing of the X-ray films is time-consuming and greatly adds to the length of time which is required for the processing of any given parcel of diamonds. Efforts to speed up the processing of a large number of diamonds have naturally led to the use of multiple cassettes and cassette holders, i .e. multiple cameras. The use of multiple duplicate cameras is obviously expensive and, at best, regardless of the number of individual cameras employed, does not permit of. cola lective handling of the films in the dark room since. the shortest time involved between successive exposures is limited by the length of time it requires to mount andremove the various cameras on and from the X-ray machine and to disassemble them in'the dark room. The present invention is designed to, overcome the above-noted limitations that are attendant upon the use of present day back reflection film holder equipment and, toward this end, it contemplates the provision of a novel camera including a composite cassette assembly and hold.- er therefor wherein the holder may remain permanently associated with the X-ray machine andwherein the composite cassette assembly may be applied to and removed from the holder on the machine by the simple expedient of dropping the cassette assembly, so to speak, into position in a pair of vertically extending guide ways provided for it by the holder, the holder and cassette being so designed that after the cassette is brought into vertical register with the guide ways and released, the same will fall by gravity into a position of accurate register with the collimator tube and diamond undergoing X-ray photography without requiring the use of special fastening screws, clips, or other fastening devices. Removal of the cassette from the holder, after the necessary exposure has been made, is effected in a reverse manner by simply lifting the cassette from the holder, after which it may be transported to the dark room. The novel cassette assembly and holder therefor comprising he present; invention makes possible a greatly simplified and expeditious processing procedure whereby a large number of diamonds may be photographed in rapid succession and the various X-ra'y films involved processed in the dark room simultaneously. Use of the cassette and holder of the present invention makes possible additional economies in the processing of film in that the phi and beta crystallographic axes of the X-ray pattern for subsequent regis ter with similar axes on the Greninger chart are applied as X-ray-impervious lines on the cassette so that these lines may be photographed onto the film. Similarly and additionally, each cassette may carry an X-ray-impervi ous serial number corresponding to an identical serial number on the diamond supporting dop so that the various simultaneously developed films in the dark room need not be individually catalogued and may later be readily identified with respect to the particular diamond which has produced the back reflection pattern thereon. The provision of a cassette and cassette holder for back reflection cameras of the character briefly outlined above being among the principal objects of the present inven' tion, another object is to provide a cassette assembly which may be readily opened for film removal and closed for film enclosure by an extremely simple manual procedure without requiring the use of any tools whatsoever. Another object of the invention is to provide a cassette assembly of this sort which, despite its simplicity of construction, makes various provisions or safeguards against the admission of light to the film at the various corners and edges thereof as well as in the region of the central collimator tube opening through the cassette. Yet another object of the invention is to provide a cassette and cassette holder for back reflection cameras wherein the holder may be initially mounted in position on the X-ray machine for proper registry with the collimator tube and diamond undergoing photographing and retained permanently in such position with the collimator tube being maintained in an operative but out-of-the-way position wherein the cassette assembly may be slid into operative position and removed from such operative position without requiring withdrawal of the end of the collimator tube from the holder for clearance purposes. Another object of the invention is to provide a casette assembly which cannot be enclosed around the X-ray film until the latter has been brought into accurate alignment with the collimator tube opening provided in the walls of the cassette and which, after closure about the film will serve to maintain the film in such accurate aligned position. The provision of a cassette assembly for back reflection cameras which is extremely simple in its construction and which is comprised of a minimum number of parts and which therefore may be manufactured at a low cost; one which is rugged and durable and which therefore will withstand rough usage; and one which otherwise is well adapted to perform the services required of it are further desirable features which have been borne in mind in the production and development of the present invention. With these and other objects in view, which will become more readily apparent as the following description ensues, the invention consists in the novel construction, combination and arrangement of parts shown in the accompanying two sheets of drawings. In these drawings: Fig. 1 is a perspective view of certain X-ray diffraction equipment including an X-ray machine and diamondtarget supporting fixture, showing the improved cassette and cassette holder of the present invention operatively associated therewith; Fig. 2 is an enlarged fragmentary side elevational view of a portion of the equipment shown in Fig. 1 with the cassette and cassette holder of the present invention shown in vertical cross section; V Fig. 3 is a front perspective View ofa cassette assembly constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention; Fig. 4 is an enlarged sectional view taken substantially on the vertical plane indicated by the line 4-4 of Fig. 3; and Fig. 5 is an enlarged perspective exploded view of the structure shown in Fig. 3. Referring now to the drawings in detail, and in particular to Figs. 1 and 2, an apparatus for making a photographic record of the back reflection pattern of a diamond according to the method disclosed in my copending application set forth above and including the improved cassette and cassette holder of the present invention has been somewhat schematically represented in these views. An X-ray machine is designated in its entirety at It and is provided with the usual X-ray tube 12 from which X-rays are caused to issue in diverging fashion as indicated at 14. A limited quantity of the X-rays 14 are collected by a collimator tube 16 and the rays issuing from the forward or outer end of tube (see also Fig. 4) pass through a central opening 18 provided in the X-ray film 20 and are caused to strike the diamond D, the crystallographic pattern of which is to be recorded on the film 20. The X-ray tube 12, film 20 and diamond D are appropriately spaced with the collimator tube 16, hole 18 and diamond D being disposed in axial alignment and the film 20 is adapted to receive Laue back reflection patterns issuing from the diamond. The diamond D is operatively supported by a fixture assembly which has been designated in its entirety at 22 while the film 24B is operatively mounted in a film holder or cassette 24 contained in a cassette holder 26, the cassette 24 and holder 26 being constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention in a manner that will be set forth in detail presently. The X-ray machine 12 includes a base 30 from which there extends upwardly a machine support 32 of generally pyramidal configuration and the front face of which has afiixed thereto in any suitable manner a forwardly extending base casting or support 34 which carries at its upper end an elongated guide rail 36, the latter serving to adjustably support thereon a camera assembly 38 which includes the cassette 24 and cassette holder 26, as well as the fixture assembly 22. The fixture assembly 22 and the manner in which it is adjustably mounted on the guide rail 36 forms no part of the present invention, such a fixture forming the subject matter of my copending application, Serial No. 740,468, filed June 6, 1958, for Apparatus for Mounting Diamonds in Tool Shanks and Other Holders, and reference may be had to this application for a full disclosure of the details thereof. Briefly however, the fixture 22 is in the form of a block 40 having an undercut groove 42 therein in register with the rail 36, the groove 42 constituting a guideway by means of which the block 41 straddles the rail 36 and is supported thereon for longitudinal adjustment therealong so that the distance between the block and X-ray tube 12 may be adjusted. The upper end of the block 40 is provided with a V-rest 44 adapted to receive therein a block 46, the underneath surface of which is shaped conformably to the shape of the V-rest 44 so that the block 46, when positioned in the V-rest, in any position of adjustment therealong, will be maintained in axial alignment with the X-ray tube 12. The block 46 is in the form of a thick walled tube having an axially extending bore 48 therethrough, and in which here there is telescopically received a diamond-carrying member 50, commonly known in the art as a dop, the dop consisting of an elongated rod which projects rearwardly from the bore 48 and carries at its outer end the diamond D, the latter being afiixed to the dop by a suitable adhesive such as shellac or the like. A set screw 52 threadedly received in the block 46 registers with an elongated V-shaped groove or flute 54 (Fig. 2) provided in the dop 50, the groove 54 constituting a fiducial refer ence whereby the dop and its contained diamond may, according to the photographic back reflection method, be accurately aligned in other pieces of equipment associated with the method and which form no part of the present invention. (camera as'sembly- 3'8 includes the'present cassette assembly 24 and the holder 26therefor. Thist camera :assembly comprises a camera block-=60 haV-ing-an undercut groove 62 formed therein bymeans oftwhich the block is mounted on and'straddlesthe guide rail-36-so that it is adj-ustable therealong to vary the distancebetween. the X-ray film 20 and theX-ray tube 12. The block- 38 con- :stitutes a base-support forthe cassette holder- 26 which may beintegral with the block. The holder--26 iswinthe form of a fiatfrectangular upstanding metal plate 64 of ap- 1 preciable thicknessand which-extends in atransverse vertical plane-across the upper face-of the block-38.

        "Description": "Description This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser. No. 10/610,256, filed Jun. 30, 2003, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,961,489 entitled \u0093A High Speed Optical System\u0094, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. BACKGROUND The present invention relates to optical systems for delivering light from a light source to a destination such as a detector, and more particularly, to such systems that are adapted to reduce back reflection from the destination back to the light source. Optical technology is used in a wide variety of fields including telecommunications, computers, and medical fields. In many applications, a light guide\u0097such as an optical fiber\u0097is used to deliver a light signal from a light source to a light detector. An important consideration in many of these systems is the optical coupling performance between the light source, the optical fiber, and the light detector. In many cases, the optical fiber is simply \u0093butt-coupled\u0094 to the light source and/or light detector. While this may be adequate for some applications, it has been found that in some cases, some of the light that is delivered to the light detector is reflected by the light detector back into the optical fiber, and in some cases, back into the light source. Such back reflection can in some cases create significant noise. For example, it has been found that such back reflections can create optical feedback in some light sources, which can produce increased jitter and increased Reflective Intensity Noise (RIN). Back reflections can also cause interferometric noise in some light sources by converting some light source phase noise into light source intensity noise. For optical communications systems, this can result in increased bit error rates (BER), and reduced performance. For other applications, such as computer and medical applications, this noise can result in reduced system performance and/or reduced reliability. SUMMARY The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for reducing back reflection into an optical system. In one illustrative embodiment, an optical element is provided between a light source and a light detector. The optical element is adapted to direct light delivered by the light source to the light detector. In some cases, the optical element is further adapted to reduce or prevent light that is reflected off the detector from substantially coupling back to the light source. This may be accomplished by, for example, including an ax icon type function in the optical element. It is contemplated that the light source may be an optoelectronic device, an optical fiber driven by an optoelectronic device, or any other light source, as desired. In one illustrative embodiment, the optical element may include a plano-convex lens that has a flat side and a convex side. In this embodiment, the light source may be positioned adjacent to the flat side, and the detector may be positioned adjacent to but spaced from the convex side. The plano-convex lens may be configured to receive a light beam from the light source and produce an annular shaped light pattern on the detector surface. When the annular shaped light pattern strikes the detector, most of the light reflected by the detector surface will not be directed or focused back to the light source by the plano-convex lens. This may help reduce the optical feedback at the light source, which can reduce jitter and Reflective Intensity Noise (RIN) in the system. This may also reduce the interferometric noise at the light source. With the reduced noise, decreased bit error rates (BER), and increased performance may be achieved. While an annular light pattern is described above in one illustrative embodiment, it is contemplated that any light pattern may be used that helps reduce the amount of back reflection that is coupled back into the light source. In many cases, this may correspond to a light pattern that has a reduced light intensity near the center of the light pattern, such as an annular, semi-annular or other like pattern. Alternatively, or in addition, it is also contemplated that the optical element may have a focal length, and that the detector may be placed in front of or behind the focal point. This may help defocus the light at the detector, which may help reduce the amount of back reflection that is coupled back into the light source. The detector may also have an anti-reflective coating to further help reduce the amount of back reflection, if desired. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a schematic view of an optical system according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention; FIG. 2 is a spot diagram of an illustrative light pattern on the detector of FIG. 1; FIG. 3 is a spot diagram of an illustrative return spot on the light source of FIG. 1; FIGS. 4 and 5 show cross-sectional views of lenses having slope discontinuities; and FIG. 6 reveals several focal adjustments of an optical element. DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 is a schematic view of an optical system 100 according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. In the illustrative embodiment shown in FIG. 1, a light source 110 emits light rays 120, which pass through optical element 130. Suitable light sources include, for example, an optical fiber that delivers light, a laser such as a Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL), a Light Emitting Diode (LED), or any other suitable device or element, or combination of suitable devices or elements, capable of producing or delivering light. After passing through optical element 130, light rays 140 impinge on the surface 150 of a detector 160. The detector 160 may be any suitable light detector, as desired. In the illustrative embodiment, the light rays 120 are conditioned by the optical element 130 into light rays or signals 140, which form an annular light pattern on the detector surface 150, as better shown in FIG. 2. FIG. 2 shows a spot diagram of an illustrative light pattern produced by optical element 130 on the detector surface 150. When the illustrative annular shaped light pattern (see FIG. 2) strikes the detector surface 150 of detector 160, most of the reflected light is not directed by the optical element 130 back to the light source 110, as shown by FIG. 3. FIG. 3 shows the back reflection or return spot on the light source 110. As can be seen, the back reflection is small (<10%), indicating that the optical feedback at the light source 110 is reduced, which can reduce jitter, Reflective Intensity Noise (RIN), and/or interferometric noise at the light source 110. As indicated above, this reduced back reflection noise may help provide a decreased bit error rate (BER) and/or an increase in performance of the optical system. More specifically, and in a fiber communications example, the reduced back reflection may help meet the return loss specification of Ethernet and fiber channels and improve the performance of the fiber communications system. In the illustrative embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the optical element 130 is a plano-convex lens. The plano (i.e. flat) side 210 of the lens 130 may act as a fiber stop to a light source (e.g. fiber) 110. In some embodiments, the plano side 210 of the lens 130 may make physical contact with the fiber 110 facet. This physical contact may be maintained using spring loading. To help reduce back reflection caused by the boundary between the piano side 210 of the lens 130 and the fiber 110 facet, the index of refraction of the lens material may be selected to match or substantially match the index of the fiber 110 core. In one illustrative embodiment, the optical element 130 is one piece and made or molded from UltemR 1010, which is a General Electric Company plastic. In some cases, an optical grease or optical adhesive may be placed between the plano side 210 of the lens 130 and the fiber 110 facet, if desired. As shown in FIG. 2, the convex side 220 of the lens 130 may be configured to form an annular or ring spot pattern on the detector surface 150. When an annular shaped light pattern impinges on the detector surface 150, most of the reflected light will not be directed or focused by the plano-convex lens 130 back to the light source 110. This may help reduce the optical feedback to the light source, which can reduce jitter, Reflective Intensity Noise (RIN), and interferometric noise in the system. As such, decreased bit error rates (BER), and increased performance may be achieved. While an annular light pattern is shown above in FIG. 2, it is contemplated that any light pattern that helps reduce the amount of back reflection that is coupled back into the light source 110 may be used. In many cases, this may correspond to a light pattern that has a reduced light intensity near the center of the light pattern on the detector surface 150. That is, in many cases, the optical element 130 may redistributed the power of the light source 110 from the center to the outskirts of the beam that is projected on to detector surface 150. Alternatively, or in addition, it is contemplated that the optical element 130 may have a focal length that images the light from the light source 110 onto a focal point 162 or focal plane, as desired, and the detector 160 may be placed in front of or behind the focal point 162 or focal plane. This may help defocus the light at the detector surface 150, which may help reduce the amount of back reflection that is coupled back into the light source 110. The detector surface 150 may also have an anti-reflective (AR) coating to further help reduce the amount of back reflection, if desired. While the optical element 130 is shown as a plano-convex lens in FIG. 1, it is contemplated that the optical element 130 may be any optical element that produces a light pattern on the detector surface 150 that helps reduce the back reflection into the light source 110. Attaining an annular distribution of light on the detector surface 150 may be achieved in any number of ways. For example, and in one illustrative embodiment, an axicon lens, also known as conical lens or rotationally symmetric prism, may be used to convert a parallel laser beam into a ring, a doughnut shaped ablation or an annular intensity profile. In some cases, an appropriate slope discontinuity may be provided in the surface 220 of the optical element 130 at or near the optical axis 230, although this is not required in all embodiments. The slope discontinuity may help provide the ax icon function to optical element 130. An illustrative surface 220 of an ax icon optical element having a slope discontinuity at optical axis 230 is shown in FIG. 4. Line 240 shows the slope of the upper part of surface 220 at optical axis 230 (r=0). Line 250 shows the slope of the lower part of surface 220 at optical axis 230. As one follows surface 220 across axis 230, there is a disruptive change of slope from slope 240 to slope 250. Slope discontinuities may be implemented in various ways. FIG. 5 shows a slope or curvature discontinuity 340 as a small notch-like shape, cusp, indentation or protrusion in surface 220 at area 260 about optical axis 230. Discontinuity 340 may be sharp, abrupt, rough or smooth. Discontinuity 340 may be of any shape or contour that helps enhance the ax icon function. Elsewhere, the slope may be continuous, such as a function of this distance from optical axis 230 or of the radius, except at optical axis 230. In some cases, slope discontinuity 340 of surface 220 may appear imperceptible to the eye. Apart from point or area 260, surface 220 may be aspherical or spherical, depending on the application. Alternatively, or in addition, much or all of the surface 220 of optical element 130 may be configured such that an annular or ring pattern of light 140 is transmitted onto the detector surface 150 of detector 160. For example, the surface 220 may cone shaped, with the tip of the cone at the vertex of the surface. Surface 220 may also be rotationally symmetric about the optical axis (e.g. z axis), and described by a single parameter \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle measured between the plane normal to the z axis at the vertex of the cone and the surface 220. The surface sag of the surface 220 may be defined by, for example: z=tan(\u03b8)r where \u0093z\u0094 is the surface sag and \u0093r\u0094 is the radial coordinate in lens units. Alternatively, the lens surface 220 may be defined by the following formulas, constants and variables: z={cr 2/[1+(1\u2212(1+k)c 2 r 2)1/2 ]}+A 1 r 1 +A 2r2 c=1/R; R=\u22120.3715 mm k=\u22121.171438E+008 A1=0.01270 A2=\u22120.7737 mm\u22121 In some illustrative embodiments, an annular light pattern may be produced on detector surface 150 by defocusing the light spot produced by the optical element 130 relative to the detector surface 150. In one illustrative embodiment, detector 160 may be positioned either in front of or behind the focus point or focal plane of optical element 130. This may cause an annular light intensity pattern on detector surface 150. The area of lower or no intensity in the center of the annular or ring distribution may be referred to as the dark spot of Arago in a well-corrected optic. FIG. 6 reveals three focus positions of an illustrative optical element 130. Detector position 270 shows an annular intensity profile of light 140 launched on detector surface 150. The intensity is shown by coordinate I and the distance from the optical axis 230 is shown by coordinate R. Detector position 280 shows a profile having the intensity of light 140 concentrated on or near optical axis 230. Detector position 290 shows an annular intensity profile similar to the profile of detector position 270. Either detector position 270 or 290 may be used to achieve an annular or ring distribution of light intensity on the detector surface 150. It is contemplated that optical system 100 may incorporate either or both of the ax icon and defocusing components to attaining an annualar light pattern on the detector surface 150. Although the invention has been described with respect to at least one illustrative embodiment, many variations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the present specification. It is therefore the intention that the appended claims be interpreted as broadly as possible in view of the prior art to include all such variations and modifications.",

        "Description": "Description FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to devices and methods for attenuating back reflections in an optical system. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Back reflection typically occurs in a fiber optic system when light in an optical system enters or exits a fiber and when light enters or exits a fiber optic component. Typical fiber optic components include fused fiber optic components and micro-optic components. Examples of fused fiber optic components are fiber optic taps and fiber optic wavelength division multiplexers. In fused fiber optic components the light stays confined to the optical fibers but at least one optical fiber is distorted by one of several processes usually involving heating the fiber while twisting it around another fiber. Micro-optic components include a variety of very small optical devices in which a microlens substantially collimates the light and free space processing of the light can occur. For instance, in a wavelength division multiplexer, the collimated light interacts with a thin film filter that has been coated to reflect one color of light while transmitting another. In another example, a 1 by 2 switch can be made by directing the collimated light from a microlens into one of two output ports. Complex optical crossconnect switches can be made in a manner similar to the 1 by 2 switch, except that the number of input and output optical fibers can reach 1000 or more. In the case of micro-optic components, back reflection occurs at every successive interface between regions with different refractive indices and in particular when the light leaves the optical fiber in transit towards the microlens element. More specifically, when light travels from glass to air or air to glass, a reflection occurs at the glass/air interface. The application of an anti-reflection coating usually can reduce the reflections from about 4% (a typical reflection at an uncoated glass-to-air interface) to about 0.25% over the range of wavelengths used in most optical systems. Typical industry standards for back reflection into an optical fiber call for reflections less than 0.00032% (\u221255 dB). The intensity of any reflections needs to be very small because reflections back into the optical fiber can destabilize the lasers that are used to generate the light. In the fiber optics industry, two methods are commonly used to reduce back reflections. One approach involves angle polishing the fiber at approximately eight degrees so that light reflected from the end of the fiber does not get reflected back into the fiber. U.S. Patent Publication 2002/0097956A1 by Kikuchi et al. describes the application of this approach to the interface between optical fibers and the substrate of a microlens array. The second method involves the use of an index-matching fluid or gel at the interface. Since these fluids are index-matched to the fiber, very little light is back reflected when joining two fibers of the same refractive index with a small amount of index-matching fluid or gel. The back reflections in these cases are often of the order of 0.0001% (\u221260 dB). In the case of a complex optical crossconnect switch, the optical fibers providing input to the microlens array are typically held in place in a fiber block. Polishing the fiber block at 8-degrees would leave some fibers closer to the microlens array than others. The variable distances to the microlens array inhibits uniformly collimating all the beams of light. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,212,316 to Presley, a standoff block with a matched refractive index is placed between the optical fiber and the bulk material into which the light is directed. Presley shows the optical fiber to terminate substantially perpendicular to the interface with the standoff block. Although this approach would avoid the problem of having the optical fibers terminate at varying distances from a microlens array, the use of a solid standoff block affixed to both the optical fiber and the bulk media makes fine adjustments during or after assembly difficult, if not impossible. What is required is a simple device for reducing back reflections that overcomes some of the difficulties encountered with prior art devices. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention describes a back-reflection reduction device that is disposed between a support structure containing a plurality of optical waveguides and a bulk media. The optical waveguides are designed for transmitting light in a predetermined wavelength range. The support structure containing the optical waveguides has a substantially flat end face at which the optical waveguides terminate. Where the optical waveguides intersect the end face, they are substantially perpendicular to it. This corresponds to a polishing angle of zero degrees, as opposed to the eight-degree polishing angle recommended in Kikuchi et al. The back-reflection reduction device of the present invention comprises a window disposed between the bulk media and the support structure. The window has a refractive index that is substantially identical to that of the optical waveguides in the predetermined wavelength range of the transmitted light. This index-matching of the window and the optical waveguides greatly reduces any back-reflections at their interface. The window has an inner side that is affixed to the support structure and an opposing outer side. As opposed to Presley, a gap exists between the window outer side and the bulk media. The gap provides an index of refraction substantially equal to unity in the predetermined wavelength range of the light transmitted through the optical waveguides. The present invention should also be construed to include an optical system that includes variations of the back-reflection reduction device described herein. Additionally, the present invention encompasses a method for reducing back reflections in an optical system. In particular, the method is useful in an optical system that includes a plurality of optical waveguides in a support structure and a microlens array. The microlens array includes a substrate on which are formed (either by deposition or some other fabrication method) lenslets on one side, the opposing side being exposed substrate. The method involves affixing a window to the support structure. The size of a gap between the window and the substrate of the microlens array is adjusted and the optical waveguides are aligned with the lenslets of the microlens array. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description that follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. Various embodiments of the invention do not necessarily include all of the stated features or achieve all of the stated advantages. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The accompanying drawings illustrate a complete embodiment of the invention according to the best modes so far devised for the practical application of the principles thereof, and in which: FIG. 1 shows an embodiment of the back-reflection reduction device as employed with a microlens array. FIG. 2 illustrates an embodiment with fiber-alignment sensors providing error signals to an adjustment mechanism. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring now to the drawings, where similar elements are numbered the same, FIG. 1 depicts an optical system with a back-reflection reduction device. The optical system includes a plurality of optical waveguides for transmitting light in a predetermined wavelength range. In the particular embodiment shown, the optical waveguides are optical fibers 100, but other optical waveguides known to those skilled in the art can be used. To reduce clutter in the figure, only one of the optical fibers 100 is labeled. The optical system further includes a support structure that contains the optical waveguides. Because in the embodiment shown in the figure the optical waveguides are optical fibers 100, the support structure shown is a fiber block 200. The fiber block 200 provides structural support and allows the optical fibers 100 to be arranged in a predetermined pattern. A preferred embodiment of a fiber block is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/236,471 of Nasiri, Liberkowski, Chen, and Jarfa for an Apparatus for Holding a Fiber Array, filed on Sep. 5, 2002, which is incorporated herein by reference, although other types of fiber blocks could also be used in the present invention. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the fiber block 200 has a substantially flat end face 210 at which the optical fibers 100 terminate. In this embodiment, the optical fibers 100 are substantially perpendicular to the end face 210. The light transmitted by the optical fibers 100 is directed to a bulk media, which is positioned to receive light exiting the optical fibers. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the bulk media is a microlens array 300 that includes a substrate 320 on which are formed lenslets 310 (only one of which is labeled to reduce clutter) on one side, the opposing side being exposed substrate 322. The lenslets 310 substantially collimate the light after it has passed through the substrate 320. In preferred embodiments, an antireflection coating (not shown) is applied to the lenslets 310 and/or the exposed substrate 322 of the microlens array 300. In general, the bulk media may take many alternative forms, such as a holder for microlenses, another fiber block containing optical fibers for receiving the transmitted light, or some other optical component. The optical system includes a window 400. The window 400 has an inner side 410 that is affixed to the fiber block 200. For the invention to perform well, the refractive index of the window 400 is substantially identical to that of the optical fibers 100 in the desired wavelength range of the transmitted light. Mismatches in the refractive index of the window 400 and the optical fibers 100 would result in reflections at the interface of the optical fibers 100 and the window 400. To reduce the chance of reflections at the interface, in some preferred embodiments, an index-matching optical adhesive or an index-matching gel 500 is used to secure the window 400 to the fiber block 200. In alternative embodiments, adhesive-free bonding or fusion bonding is used to affix the window 400 to the fiber block 200. An acceptable level of reflection at the interface of the window 400 and the fibers in the fiber block 200 is approximately 0.0001% (\u221260 dB). The window 400 also has an outer side 420 opposing the inner side 410. The distance between the inner side 410 and the outer side 420 defines the window thickness. Although the window thickness may vary considerably with different embodiments, in the most preferred embodiments the window thickness is between 1 mm and 8 mm. Although greater window thicknesses result in decreased back reflection intensities, thicker windows require the microlens array to be further from the waveguides, which may result in decreased optical coupling efficiency. The optical system is further characterized by a gap 900 between the window outer side 420 and the bulk media, which in FIG. 1 is the microlens array 300. The gap 900 has an index of refraction substantially equal to unity in the predetermined wavelength range of the light passing through the gap 900. This is typically achieved by keeping the gap 900 under a vacuum, or near vacuum, or by having the gap 900 filled with a gas. Although the size of the gap 900 will vary with different embodiments, most preferably the gap 900 is between 0.01 mm and 2 mm. In preferred embodiments, the window outer side 420 includes an antireflection coating 800 that further reduces the back reflections. In operation, a light beam exits each optical fiber 100 and enters the window 400. If the interface is substantially continuous with respect to refractive index in the wavelength range of interest, minimal reflections will occur because the window 400 has substantially the same refractive index as the optical fiber 100. In preferred embodiments, the use of an index-matched adhesive or an index-matched gel 500 at the interface helps ensure that little, if any reflection occurs. The light beam expands as it traverses the window 400. At the window outer side 420, a reflection occurs. This reflection is weaker if an anti-reflection coating 800 has been applied. The reflected beam further expands as it travels back through the window 400 towards the optical fiber 100. The double expansion of the reflected light beam significantly attenuates its intensity. Although the amount of expansion of the light beam will vary considerably in different embodiments, in some preferred embodiments, when the reflected light beam again reaches the optical fiber 100, it has an effective diameter approximately 100 times greater than the cross-sectional diameter of the core of the optical fiber 100. In such a case, the addition of the window 400 effectively reduces the magnitude of the back reflection coupled into the fiber by approximately (100)2=10,000 or 40 dB. This 40 dB reduction is in addition to the attenuation associated with the reflection at the back surface of the window, itself reduced by any antireflection coating 800 that may have been used. Therefore the back reflected light beam results in a very small back reflection coupling into the optical fiber 100. The presence of the gap 900 permits adjustments of the optical system during assembly. FIG. 1 includes an alignment mechanism 700 for adjusting the relative position of the fiber block 200 and the microlens array 300. The illustrated alignment mechanism 700 allows for adjustment of the gap 900 by tightening a vertical screw 710 against the bias of a vertical spring 730. Similarly, horizontal adjustment is achieved by tightening a horizontal screw 720 against the bias of a horizontal spring 740. In practice a six-degree-of-freedom alignment mechanism is used to ensure proper alignment of the lenslets of the microlens array with the optical fibers in the fiber block. Such a mechanism allows for translation in three perpendicular directions and tip, tilt, and clocking rotations. Various mechanisms to achieve such capabilities are well known in the art. In many preferred embodiments of the invention, one or more solid spacers 600 are incorporated to allow permanent attachment of the microlens array substrate 320 to the fiber block 200. The solid spacer 600 is disposed so as to not interfere with the light leaving the optical waveguides (the optical fibers 100 in the embodiment of FIG. 1). In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the solid spacers 600 are solder joints outside the periphery of the window 400. In this particular embodiment, the solid spacers 600 actually join the fiber block 200 (or in general, the support structure) to the substrate 320 of the microlens array 300 (or in general, the bulk media). In alternate embodiments, the solid spacers 600 may be glass, metal or silicon ridges or pedestals, or any other solid structure, as long as they are located so that they maintain the gap 900, but do not interfere with the light beams leaving the optical waveguides. In some embodiments of the invention, the solid spacers 600 join the window 400 to the bulk media. In other embodiments, the support structure, and the bulk media are secured to a housing. These embodiments facilitate handling of the optical system. In some of these embodiments, the window is also secured to the housing. An alternative embodiment is shown in FIG. 2. In this figure the alignment mechanism 700 adjusts the alignment in response to error signals generated by one or more alignment sensors 790. In general, this is performed during assembly and locked in place using a solder joint or an adhesive. The adjustment may also be continuous and ongoing, and not just performed during assembly. In FIG. 2, the alignment sensors 790 determine the strength of light beams transmitted from control optical fibers 110. In the embodiment illustrated, the control optical fibers 110 contain light signals of known strength, so variations in the strengths of the signals reaching the alignment sensors 790 through an aperture mask 315 are related to the alignment (or misalignment) of the control optical fibers 110 with respect to the control lenslets 312. The alignment mechanism 700 thereby alters the alignment to maximize the control signal received. Alternate alignment sensors are used in other embodiments of the invention. The present invention should be understood to be more encompassing than the previously described optical system. The back-reflection reduction device of the present invention comprises a window with an inner side affixed to a support structure. An opposing side of the window is known as the outer side. The window has a refractive index that is substantially identical to that of optical waveguides supported in the support structure. In the back-reflection reduction device of the present invention, a gap exists between the window outer side and a bulk media, which is positioned to receive light exiting the plurality of optical waveguides. The index of refraction of the gap is substantially equal to unity in a predetermined wavelength range of the light passing through the gap. Additional elements and limitations, including, but not limited to those previously described for the optical system should also be considered as part of the invention. The invention also includes a method for reducing back reflections in an optical system. In a specific example of applying the method, the optical system includes a plurality of optical waveguides in a support structure and a microlens array with lenslets formed on one side and an exposed substrate on an opposing side. To reduce the back reflections, the method involves: affixing a window to the support structure; adjusting the size of a gap between the window and the exposed substrate of the microlens array; and aligning the optical waveguides with the lenslets of the microlens array. In preferred embodiments, the method further comprises the step of forming a solder joint between the exposed substrate of the microlens array and the support structure. The step of forming the solder joint should occur after adjusting the size of the gap and aligning the optical waveguides with the lenslets of the microlens array. In preferred embodiments, the adjusting and aligning are performed in response to changes in error signals obtained from one or more sensors. The above description and drawings are only illustrative of preferred embodiments, and the present invention is not intended to be limited thereto. Any modification of the present invention that comes within the spirit and scope of the following claims is considered part of the present invention.",

        "Abstract": "The utility model discloses a back-reflection antenna reflector for radio wave emission and reception, which comprises an antenna assembly and a reflector. The back-reflection antenna reflector is characterized by being a rod type reflector formed by bending the two ends of at least one round rod towards the same direction into short rods. The short rods of the rod type reflector are corresponding to antennas. The back-reflection antenna reflector significantly simplifies the structure of basin-shaped antennas. A single straight rod or a signal parabola rod and arrays of multiple straight rods or parabola rods orthogonal to one another or intersecting with one another can be respectively adopted according to linear polarization (vertical polarization and horizontal polarization) and circular polarization (or elliptical polarization) radio waves.

        "Description": "Description\u00a0\u00a0(OCR text may contain errors) Suppression of Back Reflection in a Waveguide Field of the Invention The invention relates to waveguides. More particularly, but not exclusively, the invention relates to the suppression of back reflections of radiation in a waveguide used in a spectrometer. Background of the Invention Waveguides are used to guide electromagnetic radiation from one component of a device to another or to guide radiation within a component. One example of device which utilises a waveguide is a spectrometer. Spectrometers are used in many applications for measuring properties of light across a range of wavelengths. For example, a spectrometer can be used for compositional analysis, by obtaining absorption or emission spectra for an object of interest. The presence and location of peaks within the spectra can indicate the presence of particular elements or compounds. Spectrometers are commonly used for analysis at optical wavelengths, but can also be used at other wavelengths such as microwave and radio wavelengths. Spectrometers are typically relatively complex and expensive devices that require the alignment of a number of moving parts to be controlled with high precision. For example, a typical spectrometer may focus light onto a diffraction grating to split an incident beam into separate wavelengths, and the diffraction grating may be rotated to a specific angle to direct light of a particular wavelength towards a detector. In recent years chip-based spectrometers have been developed which can be highly miniaturised, have no moving parts, and can be manufactured using well-established lithography techniques. An example of such a spectrometer-on-a-chip is shown in Figure 1. The chip spectrometer 100 comprises a substrate 110, onto which are patterned a waveguide 120 and a plurality of disk resonators 130 coupled to the waveguide. Light enters the waveguide at a first end 120a and is guided towards a second end 120b. The resonators are arranged such that portions of the light in the waveguide are coupled into the disk resonators 130. Each resonator 130 is arranged to support a resonant mode at a particular wavelength such that only light of that wavelength is coupled into the resonator 130. On top of each disk resonator 130 is an electrode 140 for detecting current that is proportional to the amount of light present in that resonator. The current detected in each resonator therefore indicates the amount of light at that wavelength that was present in the input beam of light. Each electrode 140 is further connected to a signal bond pad 150 for connecting the spectrometer 100 to an external device for measuring the current. A portion of the light is not coupled into any of the resonators and reaches the second end 120b of the waveguide. Back-reflections from the end of the waveguide may give rise to interference within the spectrometer chip which degrades the performance of the spectrometer. A low reflective coating 160 is therefore evaporated or sputtered onto the second end 120b of the waveguide to stop back-reflections from light reaching the end of the waveguide. However, the application of the low reflective coating requires an additional processing step in the manufacture of the spectrometer. The invention aims to improve on the prior art. Summary of the Invention According to the invention, there is provided a structure for guiding electromagnetic radiation, comprising: a substrate; a waveguide provided on the substrate and having a first end for receiving electromagnetic radiation and a second end; and an anti-reflection region provided at the second end of the waveguide on the substrate, the length and the width of the anti-reflection region being optimised to suppress back reflection of radiation that reaches the second end of the waveguide. The back reflection in the waveguide is reduced as a result of the radiation becoming unguided as it enters the anti-reflection region where the diverging radiation field is absorbed by the material forming the anti-reflection region. By optimising the length and the width of the anti-reflection region, an effective reflectivity of almost 0% can be achieved. The waveguide and the anti-reflection region may be formed from the same material. The waveguide and the anti-reflection region may be integrally formed as a single component. They may be provided on the substrate in the same processing step. The waveguide and the anti-reflection region may be provided as part of the same layer. If the waveguide comprises more than one layers, the waveguide and the anti-reflection region may provided as part of the same layers. The layers may include a quantum well. The anti-reflection region may have a width substantially wider than a width of the waveguide. The anti-reflection region may further have a width substantially greater than a wavelength of the radiation in a material from which the anti-reflection region is formed. When the anti-reflection region is formed from the same material as the waveguide, the wavelength is also the wavelength of the radiation in the waveguide. For example, the anti-reflection region may have a width of at least 3 times the wavelength of the radiation in the material from which the waveguide and the anti-reflection region are formed. The structure may be a semiconductor based structure and the anti-reflection region may have a width of at least 3 times the wavelength of the radiation in the semiconductor waveguide. More specifically, the wavelength based on which the dimensions of the anti-reflection region is determined is not the free-space wavelength but the wavelength in the material from which the waveguide and the anti-reflection region is formed. The anti-reflection region may have a length substantially longer than a wavelength of said electromagnetic radiation in a material from which the anti-reflection region is formed. When the anti-reflection region is formed from the same material, the wavelength is also the wavelength of the radiation in the waveguide. The anti- reflection section may have a length of typically at least 5 times the length of the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation. Of course, the longer the anti- reflection region, the greater the proportion of radiation that is not back-reflected. When the waveguide and the anti-reflection region are formed from a semiconductor material, the wavelength of the radiation in the waveguide would be the wavelength of the radiation in the semiconductor material. According to the invention there is provided a photonic component comprising the structure as described above. According to the invention, there is also provided a chip comprising the structure as described above. According to the invention, there is also provided a spectrometer comprising the structure described above. The spectrometer may further comprise a plurality of resonators provided on the substrate and coupled to the waveguide. The plurality of resonators may be disk resonators Brief Description of the Drawings Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to Figures 2 to 6 of the accompanying drawings, in which: Figure 1 is a perspective diagram of a prior art spectrometer; Figure 2 is a perspective diagram of a spectrometer with a waveguide arrangement according to some embodiments of the invention; Figure 3 is a plan view of the waveguide arrangement according to the invention; Figure 4 shows a cross-section of the waveguide arrangement of Figure 3; Figure 5 illustrates a propagating continuous wave pattern in the waveguide arrangement according to the invention; Figure 6a is a graph showing how the radiation intensity at a particular location in the waveguide varies with time; and Figure 6b indicates the location in the waveguide where the intensity of radiation is monitored for the graph of Figure 6a. Detailed Description With reference to Figure 2, a perspective view of a spectrometer 200 with a waveguide arrangement according to some embodiments of the invention is shown. The spectrometer is a spectrometer-on-a-chip comprising a substrate 210, onto which are patterned an elongate waveguide 220 and a plurality of disk resonators 230 coupled to the waveguide. The waveguide can be arranged to receive and guide electromagnetic radiation of a predetermined range of wavelengths, including but not limited to optical, microwave or radio wavelengths, and may be a ridge waveguide. Light is received at a first end 220a of the waveguide and is guided towards a second end 220b, and each resonator 230 is arranged to support a resonant mode at a particular wavelength such that only light of that wavelength is coupled into the resonator 230. On top of each disk resonator 230 is an electrode 240 for detecting current that is proportional to the amount of light present in that resonator. The current detected in each resonator therefore indicates the amount of light at that wavelength that was present in the input beam of light. Each electrode 240 is further connected to a signal bond pad 250 for connecting the spectrometer 200 to an external device for measuring the current. It should be realised that although the resonators are described as separate from the waveguide, the resonators may be considered part of the waveguide. According to the invention, the spectrometer chip 200 also comprises an anti- reflection region 270 coupled to the second end 220b of the waveguide 220. The anti-reflection region provides an abrupt and wide interface at the end of the waveguide so that waves propagating at the interface between the second end 220b of the waveguide and the anti-reflection region 270 become unguided and spreads into the anti-reflection region where it diverges and becomes absorbed by the anti- reflection region. The anti-reflection region may be formed on the substrate in the same processing step as the waveguide and resonators. It may be provided in the same material or materials as the waveguide and the waveguide and the anti- reflection region may be integrally formed as a single component. The waveguide and the anti-reflection region can be formed from, for example, semiconductor material. The waveguide and the anti-reflection region can alternatively be formed from different materials. However, that would of course require an additional processing step. Hereinafter, the waveguide and the anti-reflection region will be described as formed from the same material in the same processing step. The anti- reflection region 270 may be provided as an additional feature in the mask layout of the spectrometer chip. The length and the width of the anti-reflection region are optimised to ensure that negligible back reflection of light occurs. Since the back reflection is effectively eliminated, or at least reduced using the anti-reflection region, a low reflective coating at the end of the waveguide is not required and the costly extra step of evaporating or sputtering the coating onto the waveguide can be avoided. It will be appreciated that although the anti-reflection region 270 has been described with respect to a spectrometer 200 above, it can be used to provide a mechanism for reducing or eliminating back reflection in any photonic component. A general waveguide arrangement structure is shown with respect to Figure 3 and 4. With reference to Figure 3, a light guiding section, provided by the waveguide 220, is directly connected to a radiation absorption section provided by the anti-reflection region 270. Both sections may be patterned on top of a substrate 210, as shown in Figure 4. The waveguide 220 and the anti-reflection region may be provided as one or a number of layers provided on top of the substrate as will be described in more detail below. The materials and the depths of the one or more layers are selected to guide the radiation in the waveguide without high losses but also such that the radiation is absorbed and scattered when the radiation becomes unguided and diverges in the anti-reflection region. As discussed above, the width and the length of the anti-reflection region 270 is optimised to minimise back reflection of light reaching the end 220b of the waveguide. It is contemplated that the anti-reflection region 270 may not necessarily form a rectangle but an irregular geometrical shape. The length is then considered the distance in the direction of propagation of the wave and the width is considered the distance in the direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave in the waveguide 220. As shown in Figure 3, the width Wa of the anti-reflection region 270 is selected to be substantially wider than the width Wb of the waveguide 220. The waveguide can, for example, have a width of between 0.5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9 to 5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9. The waveguide may be designed to support a single mode of resonance. Typically, the width of the waveguide Wb is of the order of the wavelength of the radiation in a material from which the waveguide is formed. It may be substantially equal to, or slightly larger than, the width of the wavelength of the radiation in the material from which the waveguide is formed. More importantly, the width Wa of the anti-reflection region 270 is substantially wider than the wavelength of the light or other radiation in the material from which the waveguide and the anti-reflection region are formed. The waveguide and anti- reflection region may be formed from a semiconductor material and the width Wa may be significantly wider than the wavelength \u03bb of the radiation in the semiconductor material. The width of the anti-reflection region should be sufficiently large to ensure that the radiation present in the anti-reflection region is no longer guided. The width Wa of the waveguide may be equal to or wider than three times the wavelength \u03bb of the radiation in the material from which the waveguide and the anti-reflection region is formed to suppress back reflections into the waveguide. The input beam may include a plurality of wavelengths, for example when the device is a spectrometer as shown in Fig. 2. In such cases, the wavelength \u03bb based on which the dimensions of the anti-reflection region are determined may, for example, be the mean wavelength, in the material of the anti-reflection region, of the wavelength range of interest in the input beam. Moreover, the length of the anti-reflection region is longer than the wavelength \u03bb of the radiation in the waveguide and the anti-reflection region. To eliminate effectively all the back reflection, the length of the anti-reflection region should be at least five times larger than the wavelength \u03bb of the radiation in the semiconductor from which the anti-reflection region is formed. The waveguide and the anti-reflection region may be formed from a material having a refractive index substantially higher than air. If, for example, the waveguide comprises a semiconductor material having a refractive index of approximately 3 and the waveguide is arranged to receive radiation of wavelength 1500nm in air, the wavelength in the light guiding section would be approximately 500nm. It has then been found that a minimum length of the anti-reflection region, for significantly reducing back reflection, would be 2.5 \u03bc\u03c0\u03b9. It is contemplated that a length of approximately 3\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9 would provide a suitable length for eliminating back reflection Moreover, the minimum width would be 1.5 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b7. As mentioned before, it is contemplated that as long as the distance of the anti-reflection region in the direction of propagation of light is equal to or longer than 5 times the wavelength \u03bb of the radiation in the material from which the anti-reflection region is formed and the width is equal to or wider than 3 times the wavelength \u03bb of radiation in the material from which the anti-reflection region is formed, the amount of reflected radiation is significantly reduced. Figure 4 shows a cross-section along the line IV-IV of Figure 3. As shown, a number of layers are deposited on top of the substrate 210. Figure 4 only shows a small number of layers and it will be appreciated that the structure can include additional layers. The waveguide may be deposited onto the substrate as one or more layers. The waveguide 220 and the anti-reflection region 270 may extend in the same plane as the waveguide and be integrally formed with the waveguide. The substrate may be manufactured from any suitable type of semiconductor. For example, the substrate may be formed from n-doped Indium Phosphide (InP) with a dopant concentration of about l-3x 1018cirf3. On top of the substrate there may be provided an etch-stop layer (not shown), which prevents etching of the substrate, and on top of the etch-stop layer there may be provided a support layer (not shown). As an example, an etch-stop layer may be formed from n-doped InGaAsP with a dopant concentration of 0.18-1.2x 1018cirf3 and the support layer may be formed from n-doped InP with a dopant concentration of 4-6x1017cirf3. The waveguide 220 and the anti-reflection region 270 are then provided as one or more layers on top of the support layer. The layers may be formed from undoped InGaAsP. On top of the one or more layers forming the waveguide there may be formed a capping layer (not shown). The capping layer may be formed from p- doped InP with a dopant concentration of about 2xl 018cirf3. There may also be provided an isolation layer for metallisation on top of the capping layer. The one or more layers that provide the waveguide 220 and the anti-reflection region 270 may have a higher refractive index than the support layer and the capping layer and the waveguide is formed from the refractive index contrast between the layers forming the waveguide and the support layer and capping layers. It will be appreciated that the layer structure described above is just an example and one or more layers may be removed or replaced. For example, if the structure does not comprise a support layer, the waveguide and anti -reflection region is provided between the refractive index contrast between the waveguide layers and the capping layer and the substrate. The one or more layers forming the waveguide and the anti-reflection region may comprise a layer with a band gap designed to absorb the radiation. It may be designed to have a low absorption coefficient to limit the absorption in the waveguide. When the light enters the anti-reflection region it becomes unguided. This means that the light travels over a greater distance through the absorbing layer and more of it is absorbed. Some of the light scatters, some of it back reflects from the semiconductor/ air interface but then scatters further and undergoes more absorption on the way back. In other words, the key concept is that the light travels a greater distance through lossy material in the anti-reflection region and is strongly absorbed. The one or more layers may form an active layer stack comprising two cladding layers between which an active absorbing layer is sandwiched. The absorbing layer may be a quantum well with a band gap designed to absorb the radiation in the anti- reflection region. The quantum well may be grown by molecular beam epitaxy or chemical vapour deposition which can control the layer thickness down to monolayers. The quantum well would be sufficiently thin to have little or no influence on the optical field in the waveguide. For example, the quantum well may have a thickness of approximately 3nm. The radiation that enters the anti-reflection region 270 is absorbed in the quantum well provided in the anti-reflection region. The waveguide 220 ensures that the optical field is at a maximum over the quantum well which helps to increase absorptions. If the waveguide arrangement of Figures 3 and 4 is provided in the spectrometer of Figure 2, the resonators 230 would also include some or all of the layers described for the waveguide 220 and the anti-reflection region 270. The capping layer, the support layer and the cladding layers may have band gaps that are greater than the highest-energy photon of interest. In contrast, as mentioned above, an active layer sandwiched between the cladding layers may have a band gap that is less than the lowest-energy photon of interest, i.e. lower than the energy of a photon of the longest wavelength that the spectrometer is configured to detect. In this way, the composition of the active absorbing layer can be used in all disk resonators in the spectrometer. As mentioned above, when the absorbing layer is a quantum well, it is sufficiently thin to have little or no influence on the optical field in the waveguide. When light of a particular wavelength enters the resonator from the waveguide, it travels multiple cycles around the resonator and the photons can be absorbed by the material in the quantum well as the band gap is sufficiently low for even the lowest-energy photons to excite electrons from the valence band into the conduction band, generating electron-hole pairs. The resulting current can be measured, and is proportion to the amount of light energy in the disk resonator. However, it will be appreciated that the structure does not have to be uniform across the resonators 230, the waveguide 220 and the anti-reflection region 270. For example, in some embodiments the absorbing layer is not provided in the waveguide 220. To achieve this, the absorbing layer in the waveguide can be selectively etched and replaced by a wider band-gap alloy or the absorbing layer can only be deposited in the disk resonators and/ or the anti-reflection region in the first place. It should of course be realised that the present invention is not limited to the layer structure shown in Figure 3 and described above, and in other embodiments other structures may be used. Figure 5 shows the results of a simulation illustrating the effect of a 2.5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9 long and 3\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9 wide anti-reflection region on radiation with a wavelength of approximately 500nm in the semiconductor material from which waveguide and anti-reflection region are formed. The x-axis indicates the distance in a direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave in the waveguide and the y-axis indicates the distance in the direction of propagation of waves in the waveguide. It is clear from Figure 5 that the radiation diverges as it enters the anti-reflection region. It is further clear from Figure 5 that the light diverges over an area substantially wider than the width of the waveguide. The region at the end of the waveguide provides an end-stop for the radiation and the back-reflection into the waveguide is minimised. Figure 6a shows the results of another simulation of a waveguide arrangement comprising an anti-reflection region as shown in Figure 6b. Light is detected by a detector in a location near the end of the waveguide coupled to an anti-reflection region substantially wider than the waveguide, as shown in Figure 6b. The location where the light is detected is indicated with an arrow. The graph of Figure 6a shows the intensity of detected light against time. It is clear from Figure 6a that a pulse of light is detected as the light received in the waveguide is guided through the waveguide towards the anti-reflection region and that virtually 0% of the light that reaches the end of the waveguide is reflected back into the waveguide. Whilst specific examples of the invention have been described, the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims and not limited to the examples. The invention could therefore be implemented in other ways, as would be appreciated by those skilled in the art. For example, it will be appreciated that the spectrometer, with respect to which embodiments of the invention have been described, may be considered to be, or form part of, a spectrophotometer. Therefore, where the term \"spectrometer\" has been used, the term could have been replaced with the term \"spectrophotometer\". Moreover, although the spectrometer has been described in places to receive and guide light, the spectrometer can be used to guide and detect electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength. Additionally, although the spectrometer has been described to comprise disk resonators, the described waveguide may be used to guide light into any type of resonators. For example, the resonators may be any high Q cavities, such as spherical resonators, microrings etc. It should be realised that although the invention has been described with respect to a spectrometer on a chip, the invention can be implemented in any device that uses a waveguide for guiding photons and in which back reflections are undesirable. For example, the invention could be used in an interferometer, optical switches, lasers, gratings etc. The invention could be used in any photonic component that utilises a waveguide. A photonic component is any component that generates, emits, transmits, modulates, processes, switches, amplifies detects and senses light. The photonic component can, for example, be used in a photonic integrated circuit, an optical sensor or in an optical communication device, including but not limited to an Add-Drop Multiplexer for an optical communication device.",

        "Description": "Description FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method for the characterization of atmospheric particles by means of a lidar device, comprising the following steps: sending a laser pulse in the atmosphere, part of which is backscattered by the particles in the atmosphere thus generating a direct backscattering signal that propagates towards the lidar device; detecting the direct backscattering signal; and determining optical characteristics of the particles on the basis of the detected direct backscattering signal. PRIOR ART The application of the lidar technique to the characterization of the atmospheric aerosols is well established. It is implemented according to several forms, by exploiting different physical phenomena and different technologies. However, it is highly limited by some general constraints, particularly concerning the actual use in the air quality control in the public and private fields, such as, for example, the control of fine particles in urban areas, the control of emissions of industrial plants, energy production plants, incinerators, etc. The underlying principle is as follows: a short-duration laser pulse (typically from some units to one hundred nanoseconds (10\u22129 s)) is sent to the atmosphere, and the backscattered radiation is collected by a reception and acquisition system (telescope, spectral selection system, detectors). The backscattered radiation transports information on the thickness of the air it passes through, while the detection time allows determining the distance between atmospheric layers. In the simplest configuration, a lidar for particles uses only one laser beam and only one detecting system tuned at the same wavelength of the laser. In such configuration, the physical process involved is that of the elastic backscattering by the gases and the atmospheric particles. In this case, the equation describing the revealed signal as a function of the distance from the apparatus contains, as the unknowns, the extinction coefficient \u03b1p(z, \u03bb) and the backscattering coefficient \u03b2p(z, \u03bb) of the particles, which constitute the optical parameters to be determined (z represents the distance of the air layer under consideration, and \u03bb the used wavelength). Actually, even supposing all the instrumental parameters as known, the lidar equation cannot be exactly solved in the unknowns \u03b1p(z, \u03bb) and \u03b2p(z, \u03bb). For this reason, when other data are not available, it is necessary to assume some hypotheses that directly regard the nature of the particles. The method typically used in this case consists in considering the value of the ratio between the extinction coefficient and the backscattering coefficient, called Lidar Ratio (LR), as known, and in applying one of the known algorithms [1, 2]. The selection of the LR value is done starting by knowing the atmospheric conditions, by statistical analyses, classifications of the particles according to the sites, conditions, seasons, relative humidity, etc. Then it shall be apparent how such selection involves enormous uncertainty, generally estimated as being between 10% and 50%, about the backscattering coefficient. The uncertainty about the extinction coefficient is obviously even higher; therefore, the arbitrariness extent in characterizing the particles often becomes unacceptable. The difficulty is overcome by providing the lidar system with the possibility to simultaneously detect also the optical signal corresponding to the Raman diffusion by the nitrogen or oxygen molecules (in both cases, they are stable constituents of the atmosphere, the concentration of which as a function of the altitude can be considered as known with a good accuracy). The simultaneous detection of the elastic signal and the Raman signal allows the application of known algorithms for the determination of both the extinction coefficient and the backscattering coefficient at the wavelength of the used laser beam [3, 4], though with some hypothesis on particular aspects, such as the dependence of the extinction coefficient upon the wavelength, which, however, can be quantitatively controlled. On the other hand, the Raman technique cannot be applied to the near-infrared wavelengths, due to the dependence of the cross section of the process from \u03bb\u22124. Furthermore, the low absolute value of the Raman cross section involves the use of high-power laser beams, with resulting economical, technical and safety problems which add up to a not negligible complexity of data processing. Furthermore, the determination of the particles chemical/physical parameters is possible through the application of inversion algorithms only if measures of \u03b1p and \u03b2p are available at different wavelengths [5, 6], particularly also in the infrared, where, however, the Raman technique cannot be applied. A different technique for the determination of atmospheric particles optical parameters provides for the provision of the lidar apparatus with an angular scan system, so that the atmosphere is monitored in a short time interval along different directions, which form known angles relative to the zenith direction [7]. In the hypothesis that the atmosphere remains stable when carrying out the measurements, and especially that the properties of the atmosphere itself depend only on the vertical coordinate (horizontal homogeneity), this technique allows to directly obtain the measurement of the particles optical thickness and the backscattering coefficient as a function of the vertical coordinate. While the technical complication relative to the handling of the lidar can be overcome, the horizontal homogeneity conditions of the atmosphere apply only in special cases, in which the weather conditions and the site orography are particularly favourable. On the whole, the applicability of this method is really limited. Other variants of the lidar technique are used in some cases (high spectral resolution lidar, differential absorption lidar); however, they are based on an intensive spectral analysis of the signal, require specific laser sources (narrow line in the first case, tunable double wavelength in the second one), and the knowledge of the nature of the target material. The application referred above is further limited also by the fact that the absorption by the particles predominantly occurs in the ultra-violet (\u03bb<300 nm) and on a broad band, resulting in difficulties related to the interference with gaseous components and the need to have tunable laser sources. With the aim to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks, the inventors [8] have recently introduced a new processing technique of the signals of two lidar apparatuses which probe the atmosphere collinearly, but in different directions, as happens for ground, satellite, or airplane-based lidars (CESC\u0097Counterpropagating Elastic Signal Combination). With that technique, it is possible to use only the elastic backscattering to obtain a direct measurement of the aerosol backscattering coefficient at any wavelength without any hypothesis on the particles chemical/physical characteristics. The technique allows independently determining also the optical thickness and the aerosol extinction coefficient, under favourable signal-to-noise ratio conditions. However, the above-mentioned technique has the drawback of being able to be applied only by simultaneously operating with two lidar devices that are positioned at the extremities of the atmosphere length being controlled, and pointing one towards the other. Therefore, it provides the duplication of the lidar apparatus, with consequences on costs, logistics, and complexity in overall system management. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention has as its object to allow an accurate determination of the optical parameters and spatial distribution, without turning to a priori hypotheses, thus avoiding the drawbacks of the prior art. According to the present invention, that object is achieved by a method for the characterization of atmospheric particles of the type defined at the beginning, in which a reflecting optical device is provided, which is positioned at a predetermined distance from the lidar device, whereby a part of the laser pulse which directly reaches the reflecting device is backreflected and then backscattered by the particles in the atmosphere thus generating a counterpropagating backscattering signal directed towards the reflecting device, which signal reaches the reflecting device and is itself backreflected towards the lidar system; and also the counterpropagating backscattering signal is detected, whereby said determination of the particles characteristics occurs also on the basis of the detected counterpropagating backscattering signal. Particular embodiments of the invention are the subject of the dependant claims. It is a further subject of the invention a lidar system for the characterization of atmospheric particles by means of a method according to the invention, which includes: a lidar device, comprising a transmitting system adapted to send said laser pulse in the atmosphere, and a receiver system adapted to detect said direct backscattering and counterpropagating signals; and a reflecting optical device positioned at a predetermined distance from the lidar device, adapted to reflect to the lidar device the part of the laser pulse that directly reaches the reflecting device and the counterpropagating backscattering signal. In brief, the present invention is based on the application of a backreflection technique for the generation of counterpropagating lidar signals. This technique allows implementing devices which use only the elastic backscattering and provide a direct measurement of the aerosol backscattering coefficient at any wavelength, without any hypothesis on the chemical-physical characteristics of the particles (thanks to an adaptation of the above-mentioned CESC algorithm). The technique allows independently determining also the optical thickness and the aerosol extinction coefficient, under favourable signal-to-noise ratio conditions. The application can provide the simultaneous employment of different wavelengths (from the ultraviolet to the infrared); in this manner, a complete characterization of the particles and the time-space distribution of the chemical-physical properties thereof, such as the concentration, refraction index, composition, and size distribution is possible. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will be set forth in more detail in the following detailed description of an embodiment thereof, given as a non-limiting example, with reference to the annexed drawings, in which: FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of a method for the characterization of atmospheric particles according to the invention; FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of a lidar system for carrying out the method of FIG. 1; FIG. 3 represents a functional block diagram of the lidar system of FIG. 2; FIG. 4 represents a constructive scheme of a lidar device receiving system operating at three wavelengths; FIG. 5 reports the overlap functions graph for the direct backscattering and the counterpropagating signals; FIG. 6 reports the graph of the lidar signal simulated as a function of time; FIG. 7 reports the simulated, range-corrected signal as a function of the distance from the lidar system; FIG. 8 reports the profile of the aerosol backscattering coefficient determined on the basis of the simulated signal, together with that of the signal assumed by hypothesis in the simulation; and FIG. 9 reports the aerosol extinction coefficient profile determined on the basis of the simulated signal, together with that of the signal assumed by hypothesis in the simulation. DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION With reference to FIG. 1, a method for the characterization of atmospheric particles provides for the use of a lidar device 10, which conventionally sends a laser pulse in the atmosphere, part of which signal is conventionally backscattered by the particles in the atmosphere thus generating a backscattering signal, which in the present description will be referred to as \u0093direct\u0094, that propagates to the lidar device 10. The laser pulse path which partially interacts with the particles, thus generating the direct backscattering signal, is indicated with Dir in FIG. 1. The proposed method according to the invention is based on the idea to place a reflecting optical device 20, such as a mirror, on the laser beam path, at a predetermined distance d from the lidar device 10. In this manner, a part of the laser pulse that directly reaches (i.e, without interacting with the particles) the reflecting device 20 is backreflected by said device, and subsequently is backscattered by the particles in the atmosphere thus generating a further backscattering signal, which will be referred to in the present description as \u0093counterpropagating\u0094, directed towards the reflecting optical device 20. The counterpropagating backscattering signal reaches the reflecting device 20 and is backreflected towards the lidar device 10, where it will be detected. The laser pulse path that partially reaches the reflecting device and is backreflected by it, and subsequently interacts with the particles, thus producing the counterpropagating backscattering signal, is indicated with Cp in FIG. 1. According to the invention, the lidar 10 itself will be able to detect both the signal corresponding to the passage through the atmospheric thickness in the direction from the lidar device to the mirror, and that corresponding to the inverse path. The situation is schematized in FIG. 1; for the sake of simplicity, the atmosphere probed by the laser beam is supposed as being of null density (i.e., negligible) everywhere but in a thin layer Sz, positioned at a distance z from the lidar device 10. The signal which is backscattered by the atmospheric layer reaches the lidar device 10 receiving system by following both the Dir path (normal lidar signal) and the Cp path (counterpropagating lidar signal), after a period of time that will be respectively equal to t 1 = 2 \u02c7 z c ; t 2 = 2 \u02c7 ( d + ( d - z ) ) c . In practice, the received signal will have 3 components: a pulse corresponding to the direct backdiffusion by the layer, at time t1, a signal due to the direct reflection of the mirror (relative to the part of the laser pulse which has not been subjected to any interactions with the particles) at time t m = 2 \u02c7 d c , and that due to the backdiffusion of the counterpropagating radiation at time t2. It shall be apparent that the relationship: tm\u2212t1=t2\u2212tm applies, which expresses the symmetry property introduced by the plane mirror. The two (direct backscattered and counterpropagating) lidar signals are temporally separated on the lidar system 10 detector, therefore they can be used for the application of an algorithm derived from the above-mentioned CESC algorithm. Let us consider the backscattered signal as having the same wavelength of the incident laser beam (elastic backscattering signal). Hereinafter, the signals expressed in terms of photon number, corrected by the square of the path from the lidar device (this correction compensates for the variation in the receiver acceptance solid angle), respectively corresponding to the direct backdiffusion of the layer Sz and to the backdiffusion of the of the counterpropagating signal, will be indicated with RCSD(z) and RCSC(z). The two signals can be written as: RCS C ( z ) = r 2 \u02c7 E 0 h \u03c5 \u02c7 A \u02c7 \u0394 z \u02c7 \u03b7 \u02c7 O \u2032 ( z ) \u02c7 \u03b2 ( z ) \u02c7 exp ( - 2 \u03c4 0 M ) \u02c7 exp ( - 2 \u03c4 zM ) ( 1 ) RCS D ( z ) = E 0 h \u03c5 \u02c7 \u0394 z \u02c7 A \u02c7 \u03b7 \u02c7 O ( z ) \u02c7 \u03b2 ( z ) \u02c7 exp ( - 2 \u03c4 0 z ) ( 2 ) In the equations 1) and 2), z indicates the distance from the lidar, E0 is the energy of the signal which is emitted by the laser, h is the Planck's constant, u is the radiation frequency, A is the receiving telescope useful surface, \u0394z is the spatial resolution, \u03b7 is the apparatus overall efficiency, r is the mirror reflectivity, \u03b2(z) is the total backscattering coefficient, and O(z) and O\u2032(z) are the lidar overlap functions. The terms \u03c4 0 M = \u222b o d \u03b1 ( \u03b6 ) \u2146 \u03b6 , \u03c4 zM = \u222b z d \u03b1 ( \u03b6 ) \u2146 \u03b6 and \u03c4 0 z = \u222b o z \u03b1 ( \u03b6 ) \u2146 \u03b6 respectively represent the optical thickness along the path from the lidar 10 to the mirror 20, along the path from the mirror 20 to the layer Sz at a distance z from the lidar 10, and along the path from the lidar 10 to the layer Sz at a distance z, while \u03b1(\u03b6) is the extinction coefficient as a function of the spatial coordinate. Let us restrict for the moment the analysis to the observation of atmospheric layers placed at a higher distance than the total overlap height. In this case, it is possible to consider the functions O(z) and O\u2032(z) as constant, and to include the value thereof in the instrumental constant. The product of the two signals will be given by: P ( z ) = RCS C ( z ) \u02c7 RCS D ( z ) = ( E 0 h \u03c5 ) 2 \u02c7 r 2 \u02c7 ( A \u02c7 \u0394 z ) 2 \u02c7 \u03b7 2 \u02c7 \u03b2 2 \u02c7 ( z ) \u02c7 exp [ - 2 \u02c7 ( \u03c4 oM + \u03c4 zM + \u03c4 o z ) ] ( 3 ) The relationship: \u03c40z+\u03c4zM=\u03c40M applies, and therefore the backscattering coefficient can be obtained from the equation (3) as: \u03b2 ( z ) = P ( z ) \u02c7 h \u03c5 E 0 \u02c7 A \u02c7 \u0394 z \u02c7 T 0 M 2 \u02c7 r \u02c7 \u03b7 ( 4 ) In equation (4) the quantity T0M=exp(\u2212\u03c40M) indicates the atmospheric transmissivity between the lidar and the mirror position. The value of T0M can be determined by a calibration procedure of the apparatus, which consists in measuring the width of the optical signal which is reflected directly by the mirror surface. In fact, this signal can be expressed as: S M = E 0 h \u02c7 \u03c5 \u02c7 r \u02c7 \u03b7 \u02c7 T oM 2 \u02c7 A s where s is the laser beam cross-section surface after the going and return path. Therefore, the total backscattering coefficient becomes: \u03b2 ( z ) = 1 S M \u02c7 \u0394 z \u02c7 s P ( z ) and the backscattering coefficient of the particles can be obtained from the relationship: \u03b2p(z)=\u03b2(z)\u2212\u03b2mol(z) in which \u03b2mol(z) represents the contribution of the molecular component, which can be determined starting from standard atmospheric models and by knowing temperature and pressure. If the ratio R of the equations (1) and (2) is taken into account: R ( z ) = RCS C ( z ) RCS D ( z ) = r 2 \u02c7 exp [ - 2 ( \u03c4 0 M + \u03c4 zM - \u03c4 0 z ) ] = r 2 \u02c7 exp ( - 4 \u03c4 0 M ) \u02c7 exp ( - 4 \u03c4 0 z ) ( 7 ) The optical thickness to the distance z will be obtained from: \u03c4 0 z ( z ) = 1 4 [ ln R ( z ) r 2 + 4 \u03c4 0 M ] ( 8 ) The optical thickness between to points of coordinates zmin and zmax is then: \u03c4 ( z ma x - z m i n ) = 1 4 [ ln R ( z ma x ) - ln R ( z m i n ) ] ( 9 ) The extinction coefficient of the particles \u03b1p(z) is therefore evaluated by deriving the equation (7) with respect to z: \u03b1 p ( z ) = 1 4 \u2146 \u2146 z [ ln R ( z ) ] - \u03b1 mo l ( z ) ( 10 ) Finally, it has to be remarked that the only hypothesis which has to be verified is that the multiple scattering contribution can be neglected. The multiple scattering influence depends on the optical thickness of the probed atmospheric layer and the solid angle under which it is observed. Unfavourable conditions occur in the presence of clouds and in dense fog conditions. The system requires a calibration which can be carried out, as indicated above, by detecting the signal directly reflected by the mirror 20. This method has the advantage of being applicable during each measurement run. The optical signal corresponding to the direct reflection of the mirror 20 is of a very high intensity, while the lidar signal, and particularly the counterpropagating one, is very weak, therefore the simultaneous detection of the two signals by the same detector would require very high dynamics of the detector and the acquisition system. This difficulty can be overcome: 1) by using a separate detector (for example, a fast photodiode) for the radiation which is reflected by the mirror, and 2) with an appropriate arrangement of the laser and the receiving apparatus (bistatic configuration). In practice, it is necessary to make so that the beam propagation direction and the pointing direction of the receiving telescope form a small angle, sufficient to make so that the radiation which is directly reflected by the mirror impinges on the photodiode, but won't enter in the telescope field of view. The situation is schematized in FIG. 2, where the laser system is indicated with 101, the receiving telescope is indicated with 103, while the separate detector for the radiation reflected by the mirror 20 is indicated with PD. The configuration can be implemented in the practice, provided that the laser beam divergence is significantly lower than the opening of the telescope field of view FOV, but this condition is always verified in the practice. In this configuration, the photodiode PD detects the direct reflection signal, which is indicated RD in FIG. 2, while the telescope 103 collects the radiation which is backscattered by the particles. It has to be considered the fact that this configuration implies that the laser beam and the telescope field of view are not completely overlapped; therefore, at small distances the overlap function O(z) indicated in the equation (2) has to be considered. In particular, this function assumes different values for the direct backscattered signal and the counterpropagating one. In both cases, it depends only on the device geometrical parameters, therefore it is a characteristic which, once it has been determined, is modified only when the apparatus undergoes some variations. It follows that it can be determined during the testing step by using two similar devices which are arranged so that the partial overlap region of one of them corresponds to the total overlap region of the other one. A different calibration methodology consists in placing a device for the determination of the particles concentration along the laser beam path, at a known distance from the lidar. A nephelometer can allow determining the backscattering coefficient in the considered point, therefore using a similar procedure to the previously described one. The frequency with which this type of calibration has to be repeated depends on the lidar system characteristics stability (laser energy, detector efficiency); such parameters can be made very stable with the currently available technologies. The functional block diagram of the lidar device 10 is depicted in FIG. 3. The arrangement of such device is per se conventional, and comprises a laser system 101, deviation optics 102, a telescope 103, receiving and spectral selection optics 104, one ore more detectors 105, a pointing system 106, and a control and acquisition electronics 107. There are several commercial solutions for the laser system 101, at different wavelengths from the IR to the UV. Table 1 shown herein below reports the typical characteristics for a laser operating in the visible region. The deviation optics 102 is composed of a beam steerer (system of two plane mirrors), with controlled micrometric handling, for the optimal alignment in the beam propagating direction. The telescope 103 can be implemented in different configurations, but most likely the most efficient one is the Cassegrain configuration, that allows having a reduced length while keeping the other parameters constant. The receiving and spectral selection optics 104 provides to send the radiation which is collected by the telescope 103 to the spectral selection system, and from the latter to the detectors. The constructive scheme for a device that operates at three wavelengths is reported in FIG. 4. A diaphragm D positioned in the focal plane of the telescope 103 defines the angular opening of the device. The collected radiation is collimated by a lens L and sent to a system of dichroic mirrors SD and narrow band interferential filters IF, which allow separating the beams corresponding to the different wavelengths. It can be necessary to vary the intensity of the signals as a function of the measuring conditions (day/night, clouds or fog) in order to maintain the response of the detectors 105 in a linear regime. To this aim, each detecting channel comprises a variable attenuator AV. A feasible solution for the detectors 105 provides for the use of photomultipliers (indicated with PM in FIG. 4) for the UV or visible radiation, and APD (avalanche photodiode) for the IR radiation. If the lidar device is used with a series of reflecting elements 20, the pointing system 106 has to orientate it on each of them, in sequence. If only one reflecting element is present, the pointing system 106 can be limited to a manual handling for the alignment with the mirror. As regards the acquisition and control electronics 107, the functions relate to: the control of the device; the acquisition of the signals of the detectors, which can take place both in an analog and digital form (photon counting). The advantages of the system according to the invention are as follows: The device allows to directly determine the spatial distribution and the time evolution of the backscattering coefficient, only starting from the elastic signal, without making any a priori hypothesis on the nature of the particles. The determination of the backscattering coefficient at different wavelengths results to be not very burdensome both from the technical and the economical point of view compared to the lidar systems utilizing the Raman technique, which in any case cannot be applied in the IR. The proposed device results to be less complex, less expensive, and more manageable than a Raman lidar system. The device allows determining with good performance the optical thickness of the probed atmospheric layer and, under favourable signal-to-noise ratio conditions, also the extinction coefficient, and accordingly the Lidar Ratio LR. By using different wavelengths, it is possible to determine the Color Index and the Angstrom Coefficient, which express the dependence of the backscattering and the extinction coefficients on the wavelength, respectively. The application of the infrared is particularly relevant for the characterization of particles having dimensions ranging between 0.1 mm and 10 mm (PM1, PM2.5, PM10). This results to be particularly useful for an efficient application of the inversion techniques in order to determinate the chemical-physical parameters of the particles (concentration, refraction index, size distribution) for which it is necessary to have measurements of the optical parameters at different wavelengths, which are sufficiently mutually spaced apart. It operates with small performance differences in both night and day hours (see simulation described below). The implementation for the stand-alone use results to be extremely simple. It is self-calibrating, i.e. it re-calibrates during each measurement. The advantages compared to the conventional measurement systems of the particles relative to the air quality control are: the time resolution can be of the order of minutes; it is possible to place the lidar apparatus and the mirror at high positions (on poles, buildings, or elevations), so that the radiation path passes through the area to be controlled (high vehicular traffic intensity roads, large particles producing areas, for example, highly industrialized ones, incinerators, energy production plants, etc.); by providing the device with a mechanical pointing system, it is possible to obtain a mapping of the particles as a function of time on a large surface. Simulation With the purpose to verify the performance of the proposed system, a complete simulation has been carried out. A typical lidar signal has been simulated, with a spatial resolution of 6 meters. Furthermore, a \u0093noise\u0094 component has been introduced, due both to the statistics and the background signal, depending on the electronic noise, the photomultipliers dark current, and the solar radiation. The wavelength used in the simulation is equal to 532 nm and corresponds to the case in which the background noise is high because of the day light, and furthermore is located in the minimum safety threshold region when using laser beams. In the simulation, only single-scattering processes by the atmospheric components have been considered, considering the Mie and Rayleigh scatterings by the aerosol particles and the molecules, respectively. The atmospheric properties have been set by using a standard atmosphere model for the molecular component, and by considering typical urban conditions for the aerosol component. In particular, a situation has been simulated in which the laser beam passes through areas characterized by different contributions in terms of particles, localized in not very large areas, simulating high vehicular traffic intensity roads and large areas, for example, highly industrialized areas. The distribution of the sources has been selected so as to represent realistic situations and to permit also the determination of the spatial resolution of the final data. For the sake of simplicity, in the calculation of the atmospheric model spatial profile, the simulation has been carried out by hypothesizing that the system is positioned at sea level and arranged so that the laser beam path is horizontal. Variations from these conditions (lidar positioned at a different altitude and/or arbitrary pointing direction) do not modify the device functionality. The values of the parameter used in the simulation are listed in the following table 1. They have been obtained by lidar measurements obtained with an apparatus really operating at the same wavelength. TABLE 1 Laser Telescope Energy per pulse (\u03bcJ) 0.5 Radius (cm) 15 Repetition frequency 2000 Focal length (m) 1 (Hz) Diaphragm opening (mm) 0.3 Divergence (with Beam 0.1 Angular opening (mrad) 0.3 Expander) (mrad) Wavelength (nm) 532 Pulse duration (ns) <40 Backreflector Receiving optics Distance (m) 2000 Overall efficacy 0.5 Opening (m) 0.6 Pass-band interferential <3 Reflectivity 0.5 filter (nm) Detector Band transmissivity 0.3 Quantum efficiency 0.3 Integration time (s) 600 Spatial resolution (signal) 10 Background-day (cps) 2000 (m) Laser beam - telescope 20 Background-night (cps) 0 axis distance (cm) Considered the laser characteristics (energy per pulse, divergence and duration with beam expander), the device fully satisfies the conditions to be complied with according to safety standards when using laser sources [9]. It has been hypothesized that the acquisition of the lidar signal occurs in photon counting, through the use of a commercially available electrical device of the Multiscaler type with a time resolution which is compatible with the spatial resolution of 10 m (dwell time \u009870 ns). For the calculation of the backscattering and the extinction coefficients, the simulated signal has been averaged over 10 minutes. In the processing, no filter has been applied to the signal. In FIG. 5, the overlap functions graph is depicted for the direct backscattering and counterpropagating signals. In reconstructing the optical parameters of the particles, these functions are considered as known by means of independent measurements, as previously illustrated. In FIG. 6, the simulated signal as a function of time starting from the instant of emission of the laser pulse is depicted. In FIG. 7, the simulated, range-corrected signal is reported as a function of the distance from the lidar device. The upper curve relates to the direct backdiffusion, while the lower one is the result of the backdiffusion of the counterpropagating reflected signal. In order to point out the contribution of the solar light, the simulated signal for both day and night measurements is reported in the Figure. In FIG. 8, the aerosol backscattering coefficient profile is depicted, determined by applying the above-described algorithm to the simulated signal, together with that presupposed in the simulation. The continuous curve represents the trend of the backscattering coefficient assumed by hypothesis. The trends obtained in the day and night situations are reported in the Figure. From the Figure, it is inferred that the backscattering coefficient profile is reconstructed with a deviation lower than 1% for distances from about 200 m to 2 km (lidar-mirror distance). The overall spatial resolution results to be equal to 6 m. The fluctuations which are present for distances lower than 200 m are due to the low intensity of the counterpropagating backscattering signal and to the influence of the overlap function, which takes very low values for very small distances. In FIG. 9, the aerosol extinction coefficient profile is depicted, which is determined by applying the above-described algorithm to the simulated signal (day and night), together with that assumed by hypothesis in the simulation. The preciseness of the reconstruction of the hypothesized profile corresponds to a deviation which is lower than 5% starting from a distance of 400 m. The overall spatial resolution results to be equal to about 50 m. The simulation of the operation of the complete device demonstrates that the extinction and aerosol backdiffusion coefficients can be determined in an absolute manner, without any hypotheses, with spatial resolutions of the order of a few meters and time resolutions of 10 min, over distances of some kms and with a performance which is practically identical for day and night measurements, using parameters corresponding to real working conditions and commercial components. Furthermore, safety problems [9] when using laser sources are easily solved with those parameters, without thereby decreasing performance. REFERENCES [1] Klett, J.

        "Description": "Description BACKGROUND The present invention relates to imagers that use one or more laser beams to expose material, e.g., for computer-to-plate (CTP) imaging to expose a printing plate. Back-reflection is a known problem with laser-based computer-to-plate imagers exposing a film or photopolymer plate. Note that imagers for imaging plates are also commonly called imagesetters. Many state of the art imagers are designed to process a wide variety of different plate types, not only from different vendors but also used for very different technical purposes. For example, Cyrel\u0099 digital imagers made by Esko-Graphics NV of Gent Belgium, may be used for imaging film, imaging conventional polymer flexographic plates, and also imaging metal-backed polymer plates. Any one of these materials is referred to as a plate herein. Different types of plates typically might use different mechanisms to hold a plate onto the drum. Metal-backed plates for example, are preferably held onto the drum by permanent magnets embedded into the drum surface. Film plate and conventional computer-to-plate (CTP) polymer plates are preferably held onto the drum surface by vacuum, e.g., by vacuum applied from the inside of the drum to vacuum grooves and/or holes on the drum surface. In many ablative plate and film imagers, problems arise from laser light not being absorbed by the layer of laser-light-sensitive ablatable material, called the \u0093ablatable-layer\u0094 herein. This unabsorbed light can be reflected by the drum surface back to the rear side of the plate or film. This can cause several problems. A first problem is that back-reflected light can start undesired ablation or uncontrolled vaporization of the remaining ablatable-layer on the front side of the plate or film. A second problem is that the grooves and/or magnets on the surface of the drum, that is, variations in the surface property of the drum will affect the amount of back-reflected light either because of the variations in the drum surface absorption or because of variations relative amounts of reflected light and scattered light. As an example of the second problem, suppose, for example, that image data is used that in a properly exposed plate would generate an image having a constant screen ruling. Suppose further that the grooves and/or magnets on the surface of the drum are regular structures. These structures cause changes of the back-reflected light, and as a result, instead of the image having a constant screen ruling, there may be, in addition, images that are similar to the regular variations on the drum surface caused by the grooves and/or magnets. One common workaround is to use a laser whose laser radiation has high divergence. One example of such a laser is a multi mode laser diode. In such a case, the light from the laser will diverge so strongly that the back-reflected beam is not likely to have sufficient energy density to cause any ablation or other effect on the ablatable layer of the plate. This approach however has the disadvantage that the depth of focus for such a laser beam is very small. Consequently, the distance between any focusing optics used to focus the beam, and the plate surface has to be accurately maintained at a constant level, either by use of high mechanical accuracy or by an automatic focusing systems. In either case, the solution is relatively expensive. Another solution is to use a use a drum whose surface is made from a material that absorbs radiation well. Unfortunately, most good absorbing materials such as black paint or anodized aluminium, might be, and likely will be ablated or discolored if exposed to a laser beam, so in time, the radiation absorbing property will be significantly reduced. SUMMARY It is a general object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one disadvantage of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative. One particular embodiment includes a method comprising exposing a plate on a support surface of an imager using one or more laser beams, the exposing while there is a metallic screen structure located on the support surface between the plate and the support surface such that the amount of back-reflected radiation is reduced compared to the plate being placed directly on the support structure with no screen between the plate and support surface. One embodiment includes an apparatus comprising: a base structure including a support surface of an imager that uses one or more laser beams to expose a plate, the support surface configured to support a plate thereon; and a metallic screen structure located on the support surface between the plate and the support surface such that the amount of back-reflected radiation is reduced during imaging of the plate using the imager compared to the plate being placed directly on the support structure with no screen between the plate and support surface. In one embodiment, the screen structure is made of a metallic material that is relatively resistant to laser radiation in the range energy densities that would occur at the rear side of a plate during the imaging if no metallic screen structure was located on the support surface. In one embodiment, the imager is a drum imager including a drum, and wherein the support surface is the surface of the drum. In one embodiment, the imager is a flatbed imager and the support surface is the relatively flat surface of the flatbed imager. In one embodiment, the plate is metal-backed plate, and the support surface has one or more magnetic structured configured to help keep the metal-back plate on the surface, and wherein the metallic screen structure includes a magnetizable material such that the plate is maintainable on the combination of the support surface and the metallic screen structure thereon. In one embodiment, the support surface has one or more vacuum grooves and/or holes to which a vacuum is applicable, and the screen structure has sufficient relative permeability to air, such that when a vacuum is applied to the vacuum grooves and/or holes, the plate is maintainable on the combination of the support surface and the metallic screen structure thereon.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Described herein is a method and an apparatus that is operative to ensure a relatively low level of back-reflected laser radiation during exposure of a plate in a computer-to-plate imager that uses one or more laser beams for the exposure. Embodiments of the invention are applicable to both drum imagers and flatbed imagers. The description, however, is mostly of an embodiment for use in an external drum imager. How to modify for a flatbed imager would be clear and straightforward to one of ordinary skill in the art. FIG. 1A shows in simplified form a perspective view of one embodiment of an external drum imager 100, e.g., a computer-to-plate exposing imager that can include an embodiment of the present invention. The imager 100 includes a substantially cylindrically shaped drum 105 that is rotatable about an axis 113. The drum has a support surface on which a plate is placeable. The drum 105 and its support surface 103 is shown with a plate 107 wrapped around the drum's support surface 103. The imager 100 includes a laser and optical system, shown in simplified form as 109, generating a laser beam 111 that is modulated by image data provided by a computer (not shown). Many of the elements of the imager are not included in order to simplify illustrating the imager 100. As the drum 105 is rapidly rotated with the plate 107 on the surface 103 of the drum sleeve 105, the laser beam moves in a transverse (fast scan) direction 115 relative to the drum surface and this generates one or more exposed circumferential lines in the transverse direction perpendicular to the direction of the axis 113 of rotation. At the same time in one embodiment, the laser beam moves in the longitudinal (slow-scan) direction 116 parallel to the axis of rotation 113. Such exposing is commonly known for external drum scanners. In one embodiment, the drum 105 includes a set of vacuum grooves 119, with in one version, each groove forming a circular track around the circumference of outer surface of the drum 105. Other versions have the vacuum grooves arranged differently, and in all versions, the vacuum grooves, if present, are arranged to help maintain a plate on the outer surface by applying suction to the grooves. In another embodiment, vacuum holes rather than grooves are used. In yet another embodiment, a combination of grooves and holes is used. In one embodiment, the drum includes permanent magnets 117 embedded into the drum surface in order to help maintain a metal-backed plate on the outer surface. FIG. 1B shows in simplified form a perspective view of an alternate embodiment of an imager, this imager 150, e.g., a computer-to-plate exposing imager being a flatbed imager 150 that can include an embodiment of the present invention. The imager 150 includes a support structure 155 having a substantially flat support surface 153 on which a plate is placeable, such a structure 155 shown with a plate 157 on the surface 153. The imager 150 includes a laser and optical system in combination with a modulation system generating a laser beam 161 that is modulated by image data provided by a computer (not shown). As in FIG. 1A, many of the elements of the imager are not included in order to simplify illustrating the imager 150. A mechanism, either in the form of a rotating polygon, or a holographic system is used to case the laser beam to generate exposed lines in the transverse direction 165 substantially perpendicular to a longitudinal direction 166. The plate and beam are slowly moved relative to each other in the longitudinal direction 166. Such exposing is commonly known for flatbed scanners. The support surface 153 may also include a set of vacuum grooves and/or vacuum holes (not shown) arranged to help maintain a plate on the surface by applying suction to the grooves, and may further have a set of permanent magnets (not shown). The remainder of the description will be mostly for the drum scanner, e.g., as shown in FIG. 1A, and those in the art will understand how to modify the description for the flatbed configuration of FIG. 1B. Internal drum imagers also are known, and an embodiment of the invention also may be applicable to such an imager. FIG. 2 shows in simplified and enlarged form a cross-section near the support surface of an imaging drum or flatbed scanner. Suppose this is the surface 103 of the drum 105 of the drum scanner of FIG. 1A near the edge of the plate. Note that for simplicity, no curvature is shown. The plate 107 is assumed to be a polymer plate with a layer 203 of ablatable material. The plate is shown on the support surface 103 of the drum. The laser beam 111 is shown moving on the transverse (fast) direction 115 as a result of rotation of the drum. After traversing the cross-section of the plate, some of the beam 111 is back-reflected to back-reflected beams 205 from the surface 103, and as shown, some of this may expose the back of the ablatable material 203. It is desired to reduce or eliminate the back-reflected light 205 that can hit the back of the ablatable material 203. One embodiment of the invention is shown in the flowchart of FIG. 5 and includes in 503 attaching or placing a metallic screen structure on the support surface of the imager; and in 505 exposing a plate on the support surface of the imager using one or more laser beams while there is the metallic screen structure located on the support surface between the plate and the support surface, such that the amount of back-reflected radiation is reduced compared to the plate being placed directly on the support structure with no screen between the plate and support surface. The screen structure is made of a metallic material that is relatively resistant to laser radiation in the range energy densities that would occur at the rear side of a plate during the imaging if no metallic screen structure was located on the support surface Another embodiment of the invention includes the support surface of the imager and a metal screen in sheet form that is modified to be on the support surface 103 of the imager, e.g., surface 103 of drum 105. FIG. 3A shows a substantially cylindrically shaped sleeve 301 made of a metal screen material and configured to fit over the imaging drum, e.g., drum 105 on the support surface 103. FIG. 3B shows the support surface 103 of drum 105 with the embodiment of the sleeve 301 of screen material on the surface 103. The screen material is also configured to be relatively permeable to air so that covering vacuum groves or holes such as grooves 119 does not substantially reduce the attractive forces of the vacuum to the plate. Experiments were performed using a sleeve 301 made from off-the shelf metal screen originally designed for another purpose\u0097for rotary screen textile printing. Manufacturers of such screen material include Stork Prints B.V. of Boxmeer, the Netherlands, Saxon Screens Rotationsschablonen GmbH of Frankenberg, Germany; Saueressig GmbH+Co. of Vreden, Germany, and Rothtec Engraving Corporation, New Bedford, Mass., USA. Such screens are typically made of nickel or a nickel alloy that the inventors have found is sufficiently resistant to laser radiation in moderate energy densities as would typically occur at the rear side of a polymer plate or film during exposure as a result of back-reflected radiation. Such screens have been found by the inventors to easily be attracted by the magnetic forces of a drum equipped with magnets such as magnets 117. Furthermore, the inventors found that such screen material is very permeable to air. For example, in some embodiments, the screen material has rhombic structures, and in other embodiments, honeycomb-like grid structures. The relative permeability to air makes it possible to cover vacuum groves or holes such as grooves 119 without substantially reducing the attractive forces of the vacuum to the plate. One embodiment the screen structure includes a woven metallic fabric. In another embodiment, the screen structure is made using a galvanic process. While off-the shelf screens manufactured for other purposes are usable, the inventors found that there are some properties that are even more desirable to reduce unwanted ablation by back-reflected laser radiation. One property is that the holes are not too wide so that the screen sufficiently reduces the back-reflected laser light during exposure. The inventors carried out initial tests with 60 holes per inch and 125 holes per inch and these worked well. Mesh of up to 200 holes per inch work sufficiently well. Typically, a screen with between 110 and 140 holes per inch is used. Another property is relative permeability to air. The inventors have found that screens with a relative open area of approximately 25 to approximately 50% of the overall area are suitable, at a mesh range of between 60 and 200 holes per inch work sufficiently well. Another property is relative roughness in order to reduce backscatter from the screen itself. The undesired effects of backscatter are based mainly on reflection. FIG. 4A shows a perspective view including a cross-section through the grid of one rotary screen 403 on the support surface 103. The top surface 405 of the screen has a relatively large area parallel to the plate surface. FIG. 4A shows four example incident beams 411, 413, 415, and 417, and each incident beam's respective resulting reflected beam 412, 414, 416, and 418, respectively. As can be seen, because of the top surface 405 having a significant area parallel to the plate, the reflected beams 412, 416, and 418 are reflected straight back (shown almost parallel to the respective incident beam but at a slight angle in FIG. 4A for illustrative purpose) either from the top surface 405 or the drum surface 103. Such a screen allows a significant amount of light to be reflected back to the plate surface. FIG. 4B shows a cross section of an improved screen 421. The shape of the screen 421 is slightly modified from that of the screen 403 of FIG. 4A in a way that the main part of oncoming light is more or less scattered in various directions. In particular, the sides of walls of holes are relatively curved, e.g., more than the case of FIG. 4A in order to direct more of the incoming radiation into different directions. The flat part on top of the grid is also curved for the same reason and small compared to the structure of FIG. 4A. That is, the screen structure has a structure closest to the back of the plate and parallel to the support surface that is relatively small. These properties result in a reduction of the direct back-reflection of the laser radiation propagating towards the surface of the drum. More of the radiation is reflected in a diffuse manner instead of being reflected in the direction of origin as is the case with the screen of FIG. 4A. Furthermore, the opening between the bars has become smaller reducing the area of the drum surface which can directly reflect the incoming light, even though the % of the screen is the same. Consider again the four example incident beams 411, 413, 415, and 417, and each incident beam's respective resulting reflected beam 422, 424, 426, and 418, respectively. Reflected beams 422 and 426 are now less likely to cause a problem than the corresponding reflected beams 412 and 416 of FIG. 4A. Reflected beam 418 could be problematic in both cases, being through the opening and from the support surface 103, and reflected beams 414 and 424 are not likely to cause back-reflection problems in both cases. As can be seen, because of the top surface 405 having a significant area parallel to the plate, the reflected beams 412, 416, and 418 are reflected straight back (shown almost parallel to the respective incident beam but at a slight angle in FIG. 4A for illustrative purpose). Such a structure as shown in FIG. 4B can be easily obtained from a structure such as shown in FIG. 4A by using a galvanic manufacturing process as is commonly used for nickel screen sleeves for textile printing. One embodiment uses a 125 holed per inch screen made by a galvanic process to have relatively curved sides and relatively little flat area on the top surface. Those in the art will be familiar with many galvanic processes. One such process includes: 1. A copper cylinder being covered with an opaque material, e.g., a black ink-like material. 2. In a laser engraving machine, an image of a honeycomb-like structure in the size of the desired mesh being ablated from the cylinder. 3. In a galvanic solvent, nickel is accumulated to the areas on the copper cylinder revealed by the engraving process. 4. After the nickel screen which now has been built around the copper cylinder has reached a required thickness, the nickel screen is expanded by hot water and thus removed from the copper cylinder to result in a nickel sleeve. In one embodiment, the surface of the screen has a relatively rough surface rather than a relatively smooth surface. One embodiment includes etching the screen to result in a screen with a fine etched surface. While one embodiment uses a screen made from nickel, alternate embodiments may be made from any kind of metal and metal alloy that can be arranged in a screen or fabric structure. Different embodiments use one or more of nickel, iron, steel, brass, aluminum, copper, silver, gold, and/or platinum. While one embodiment includes exposing a plate on a rotating drum imager which has a screen structure thereon, another embodiment includes exposing a plate on a flatbed imager. While the discussion above mentions screens that are likely to have a regular structure, alternate embodiments use screens that do not have a regular structure. Similarly, the relative transparency of the screen need not be uniform, and so forth. Many variations are possible. Reference throughout this specification to \u0093one embodiment\u0094 or \u0093an embodiment\u0094 means that a particular feature, structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention.

G01n 23/02, 23/20; H013 37/20 US. Cl. 250-515 6 Claims ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE The present application is concerned with apparatus for permitting a rapid positional interchange of a cassette and a sample specimen holder relative to an X-ray tube to enable, optionally, either a back-reflection or a transmission diffraction method of X-ray photography. In brief, the apparatus includes :a single cassette having a central aperture and adapted to both types of diffraction method, a sample specimen holder, individual supporting members for the cassette and specimen holder, means slidably interconnecting the supporting members, attaching means identified with the X-ray tube, and individual manually-releasable attaching means identified with each of the supporting members. The manuallyreleasa-ble attaching means are complementary to that identified with the X-ray tube, and permit rapid attachment to or release from the latter to make readily possible either type of X-ray photography. In X-ray difiraction work a sample of material is held at a predetermined distance from a photographic film and an X-ray beam is directed to impinge upon the sample. The beam is reflected back from the sample to the film, or scattered by the sample to impinge upon the film in a pattern indicative of the structure, orientation, etc. of the sample. For example, the sample may be a crystal which deflects the X-ray beam in a pattern dependent upon the crystalline structure. Many types of commercially available X-ray generating equipment are provided with suitable means for supporting a photographic film and sample in predetermined relationship so that the X-ray beam may strike first the sample and then the film in a manner which will yield useful information from the exposure pattern on the film. X-ray photography of the type described above includes the techniques generally known as frontand backreflection Lau photography. According to the back-reflection Lau technique a collimated X-ray beam is directed through an opening in the cassette to strike the sample which is positioned on the opposite side of the film from the X-ray source. In the front Lau technique the sample is positioned between the X-ray source and the film. In order to interpret the exposure pattern produced on the film by the deflection of the beam from the sample, it is necessary to know the distance between the sample and the film plane at the time of exposure. It is also sometimes desirable to make exposures with different sample-to-film distances. It is a principal object of the present invention to provide means for supporting an X-ray cassette and sample holder in predetermined relation to one another and to means for generating an X-ray beam which allows rapid and simple rearrangement to change from front to back reflection Lau photography. A further object is to provide a positioning and supporting system for an X-ray diffraction cassette and sample holder wherein the distance from the sample to the film plane may be quickly and accurately changed between a plurality of known distances. A still further object is to provide apparatus for supporting an X-ray cassette and sample holder of previously known design and for positioning the cassette and sample holder in any of a variety of predetermined positions relative to one another and to an X-ray tube, also of conventional design. Still another object is to provide novel apparatus for mounting and positioning an X-ray cassette, tube and sample holder in such a way as to enhance the versatility of the equipment in making X-ray diffraction exposures. Other objects of the invention will in part be obvious and will in part appear hereinafter. The invention accordingly comprises the apparatus possessing the construction, combination of elements and arrangement of parts which are exemplified in the following detailed disclosure, and the scope of the application of which will be indicated in the claims. For a fuller understanding of the nature and objects of the invention, reference should be had to the following detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein: FIGURE 1 is an exploded, perspective view of the apparat'us of the present invention, also showing in phantom lines certain known elements with which the apparatus may be associated; and FIGS. 2-5 are a series of perspective views of the apparatus of FIG. 1 shown in a number of difierent positions in which it may be placed for different uses. Copending US. patent application Ser. No. 397,938, filed Sept. 21, 1964 of Herman E. Erikson describes an X-ray cassette which may utilize film of the self-developing type. Cassettes of the type are presently commercially available from Polaroid Corporation, Cambridge, Mass. under the designation Polaroid XR-7 Land diffraction cassettes. Such cassettes are designed to utilize self-developing film in 4 x 5 inch format; film packets of this type are also manufactured and sold by Polaroid Corporation and designated .as Types 51, 52, 55, 57 and 58. The apparatus of the present invention is shown in combination with a casette of this type, although it will be understood that the apparatus is capable of supporting other types of cassettes within the scope of the invention. Also shown in the drawings are a sample holder and X-ray tube, having certain other conventional elements associated therewith, of a type available from Siemens America, Inc. (a corporation of the Siemens Groups in Germany) 350 5th Ave., New York, N.Y. It will be further understood that while an appropriate X-ray tube, cassette and sample holder are necessary for practical use of the invention, the latter is not limited to use with the particular form of such conventional apparatus shown in the present drawings. That is, dimensional changes or other structural variations within the scope of the invention may be made as required to provide use of the invention with other forms of cassettes, sample holders and X-ray tubes. Referring now to the drawings, in FIG. 1 is shown an X-ray tube, cassette and sample holder designated, respectively, by the reference numerals 10, 12 and 14. Since these elements are of conventional, commercially available designs, they are shown in outline form only and the details thereof will be described only insofar as is necessary to a complete understanding of the present invention. X-ray tube 10 includes appropriate means for generating an X-ray beam and for collimating the beam along an axis designated in FIG. 1 by the numeral 16. Additional elements 18 are supported on X-ray tube 10 and may include means for supporting a photographic film for use in certain applications. Although the present invention is not concerned with applications wherein the film is held within elements 18, a portion thereof may be used to assist in connecting and supporting the apparatus of: the invention in predetermined relation to X-ray tube The apparatus of the invention includes first and second support members 20 and 22, respectively, which are shown in the form of generally rectangular plates. Plate 20 includes openings 24 through which screws 26 extend to engage internally threaded openings 28 in a portion of cassette 12. Also, dowel pin 30 may be provided on plate 20 to mate with opening 32 in cassette 12, thus serving to locate the cassette more precisely with respect to plate 20. 'Pin 30 may be removable or retractable, if desired, so that other cassettes not having an opening in the proper place for receiving pin 30 may be used with the apparatus. Openings 34 and 36 are also provided in plate 20 and cassett 12, respectively, concentrically with axis 16 of the X-ray beam. Plate 20 also includes raised boss 38 into which extends a smaller boss at opening 36 of the casette, thereby serving as an additional locating means. Thus, the X-ray beam may pass through plate 20 and cassette 12 to strike a sample positioned on the opposite side thereof for back Lau photography as explained more fully in connection with FIGS. 2 and 3. A pair of rods 40 extend rigidly in one direction from plate 22 and a second pair of rods 42 extend rigidly in the opposite direction. Plate 22 also includes a pair of openings 44 extending therethrough. Elongated rods 46 extend slidably through openings 44 in plate 22 and through a similar pair of openings 48 in plate 20. Bar 50 is alfixed to the ends of rods 46 which extend through openings 48 in plate 20 by any appropriate means such as pins 52 which extend through the bar and into the rods. The ends of rods 46 which extend through openings 44 in plate 22 are similarly affixed to bar 54. Thus, plates 20 and 22 are movable along bars 46 toward and away from one another, the maximum extent of such movement being limited by bars 50 and 54. The positions of plates 20 and 22 may be selectively fixed upon bars 46 and tightening thumb screws 56 and 58, respectively. Rods 40 are provided on plate 22 for the purpose of mounting sample holder 14 which is of a type including a pair of openings 60 and receiving rods 40. Screw 62 extends through a wall of the sample holder to engage one of rods 40, thereby fixing the position of sample holder 14 with respect to plate 22. A sample of material to be placed in the path of the X-ray beam may be held between engagement portions 64 of sample holder 14. Other types of conventional engagement members may also be positioned upon the sample holder depending upon the type and size of material under study. The construction of sample holder 14 also permits some adjusting movement of the sample with respect to the axis of the beam. A pair of rods 66 extend fixedly from one side of plate 20. Rods 66 correspond in size and spacing to rods 42 on plate 22, but the two pairs of rods are disposed in opposite directions. Portions 68 of elements 18 include openings into which either rods 66 or rods 42 may extend, thereby connecting the apparatus of the invention with the cassette and sample holder mounted thereon to the X-ray tube. Thus, when the apparatus is mounted with rods 66 engaged in portions 68, cassette 12 is positioned between tube 10 and sample holder 14; when the apparatus is mounted with rods 42 engaged in portions 68, sample holder 14 is positioned between tube 10 and cassette 12. This provides means for making either front or back Lau exposures without dismounting either the sample holder or cassette. Referring now to FIGS. 25, the apparatus is shown in a variety of positions which may aid in an understanding of the functions of the previously described elements. In FIG. 2 the elements are arranged for a back Lau ex posure with the sample held relatively close to the film plane. Rods 66 are engaged in portions 68 of the elements associated with X-ray tube 10. In this position it will be noted that collimating tube 70 extends into opening 34 of plate 20. Plates 20 and 22 are moved along rods 46 to a position as close to one another as possible, the minimum distance between the two plates being limited by portions 72 on plate 20 and portions 74 on plate 22. With plates 20 and 22 moved as close together as possible the sample of material held by holder 14 will be positioned at a predetermined, known distance from the film plane within cassette 12. Turning now to FIG. 3, the apparatus remains mounted with respect to tube 10 by engagement of rod 66 in portions 68. Therefore, the elements are still arranged for back Lau exposure. However, plates 20 and 22 have now been moved as far apart as possible, the maximum extent of the relative movement being governed by bars 50 and 54. It may be seen in FIG. 3 that plates 20 and 22 are in engagement with bars 50 and 54, respectively. Hence, in moving from FIG. 2 to FIG. 3, cassette 12 has remained stationary with respect to tube 10 but sample holder 14 has been moved a greater distance away from cassette 12. With the elements in the position shown in FIG. 3 a back Lau exposure may be made with the sample at a second predetermined distance from the film plane. For example, the sample may be positioned at a distance of 3 cm. from the film plane in the FIG. 2 position and 5 cm. in the FIG. 3 position. Referring now to FIG. 4 the position of the elements has been reversed by removing rods 66 from portions 68, turning the entire apparatus 180 (in a translatory rather than rotational direction with respect to axis 16 of the X-ray beam) and inserting rods 42 in portions 68. Thus, sample holder 14 is now positioned between X-ray tube 10 and cassette 12 so that front Lau exposures may be made. The elements are also in position for making front Lau exposures as illustrated in FIG. 5, but again the distance between the sample and the film plane has been changed. In FIG. 4, plates 20 and 22 are in the position of closest proximity as governed by portions 72 and 74. In FIG. 5, plates 20 and 22 are as far apart as possible as determined by the fixed positions of bars 50 and 52 on rods 46. In the conventional form of X-ray apparatus shown in the present drawings elements 18 are connected to tube 10 by means of a pivot joint at 76. The turning moment created by the weight of elements 18 and the apparatus of the present invention connected thereto, maintain the end of adjusting screw 78 in contact with portion 80 of tube 10. Screw 78 provides means for adjusting the angular position of the cassette and sample holder with respect to axis 16 of the X-ray beam. From the foregoing description it may be seen that the adapter system of the present invention provides means for supporting and positioning a conventional X- ray cassette and sample holder in such manner as to allow convenient and precise repositioning of the elements for a variety of different X-ray diffraction exposures. The elements may be moved to change from front to back Lau exposure merely by removing one pair of rods, or other such engaging means, from engagement with a .portion of the tube, or elements associated therewith, and placing a second pair of rods in engagement therewith. Also, the elements may be quickly and easily moved to provide either of two precisely predetermined distances between the sample and the film plane in both the front and back Lau orientations. It will be further noted that the cassette remains stationary with respect to the tube as the sample holder is moved between the two relative positions during back Lau exposures, and the cassette is moved while the sample holder remains stationary during front Lau exposures. That is, the element (cassette or sample holder) nearest the X-ray tube remains stationary as the sample-to-film distance is changed. This situation is desirable in maintaining the optimum intensity of the X-ray beam on the surface of the film since beam intensity decreases with distance in accordance with the inverse square law. Since certain changes may be made in the above apparatus without departing from the scope of the invention herein involved, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.

Application August 16, 1951, Serial No. 242,167 Claims. (01. 250-52) (Granted under Title 35, U. S. Code (1952), sec. 266) The invention relates to a novel apparatus for electronic, spectrometric analysis of back-reflection diffraction. The primary object of this invention is to provide an apparatus for and a method of stress determination by electromagnetic wave energy, for example X-ray, of an object without destroying the object and while the object is maintained in a stationary position. Another object of the invention is to provide a mechanism for constraining a wave energy receiving detector of known type to lie always on a great focus circle tangent to the irradiated surface of the test specimen by constraining with a circular or arcuate support whose center of curvature is at the irradiated surface, a radially movable carriage carrying the detector, the carriage being further constrained in its radial movement by a link which is connected at a centro with the carriage and pivoted at the center of the great focus circle of the focus sphere to which the specimen is tangent. Ancillary objects will be come apparent in following the description of the drawings where- 1n: Fig. 1 is a perspective view of the apparatus, some of the elements being shown schematically, the irradiated surface bein shown in a position normal to the center line of diverging electromagnetic waves, while two of a great number of possible positions of the detector are shown for the resulting focus circle; Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the apparatus in Fig. 1, but shows the irradiated surface located in a position 45 rotated from the center line of diverging electromagnetic waves, while one possible position of the detector is shown for the resulting great focus circle, tangent to said surface at a point center of contact by the wave energy, and Fig. 3 is a sectional view of the carriage and its support subassembly, this view being taken on the plane of line 3-3 of Fig. 2 and in the direction of the arrows. Materials in the solid class, for example various metals and alloys such as used in aircraft power plants, have presented problems in failure as a result of stresses, vibrations, crystalline structures being weaker than others, and for other reasons. Stresses and vibrations have long been a standing challenge to detection, measurement and dissolution. In many instances the existing methods of measurement require destruction or serious mutilation of a material, and sometimes without producing any reliable results. The search for a more flexible list of methods of investigation has in recent years brought forth the science and technique of diffraction by employing electromagnetic wave energy. In particular X-ray diffraction has many possibilities of advantage in the basic study of stresses or strains, vibration and other physical states within the atomic structure of an object used as a specimen. From basic theory it is known that the angle made with an irradiating beam by any component of a diffraction spectrum is determined by the small magnitude of the space between layers of atoms in a material. As the solid is stressed, the angle changes as the atomic spacing changes with compression and tension. The precision and accuracy required in the measurements have placed limitation on the use of photographic recording of the diffraction spectra. More sensitive electronic or electrical detectors have been developed and applied which are applicable only to small rotating specimens. My invention provides for the application of such detectors prine cipally, although photoelectric-type radiation recording means may be used, to materials of various sizes and degree of mobility. Moreover, these known detectors can be made to analyze directly, intensity distributions in diffraction spectra as well as angular displacements. The occurence of distortion of angular displacements is well known where diffraction is attempted of highly-alloyed, hardened or deformed metals. The development of the detectors will have the added advantage of detection or resolution of the source of distortion strains in the atomic lattices in such metals, of measurement of the magnitudes of the associated stresses by accurate measurement of said intensities, and of any other variable diffraction characteristics. Such an instrument can be applied also to the basic studies of many other problems concerning the atomic structures in solids; for example, in thermal distortions in hot disk rims, in fatigue fracture, in phase changing cracking, or in metallic creep and flow. A number of diffraction subtelties, evidences that have been too diiTcult for concrete handling in the past, are becoming useful as tools in the basic research on or routine control of solids with the detector. The illustrated device is a structural embodiment of the invention which places a sensitive detector on a focus circle and simultaneously, at any angle with the irradiating beam, irradiating a specimen that may remain always in a fixed position. The detector may operate in a range limited only by the increase in size of the focus circle to a point where the air path-length of diffracted rays is prohibitive. Maintaining the position of the detector on a focus circle permits the use .of a fixed-specimen position, which in turn allows large bodies to be examined. In Figs. 1 and 2, typical arrangements are illustrated. In each instance there is a source S of electromagnetic wave energy, for example an X-ray machine which includes among other elements, an emission slit or opening l2 in a plate H, the slit and plate being separated from the source S, shown schematically. The object l6 which constitutes a specimen, has an irradiated surface tangent to a great focus circle l8 of the focus sphere, and the back reflection therefrom is received in the detector D, which includes a receiving opening or slit separated from the body of the detector D, shown schematically. The detector D is maintained always on the focus circle [8. The detector D is supported by a means constraining the motion thereof so as to retain the detector D always in contact with focus circle l8. This means includes a track or support 22 having a slot 24 which is preferably arcuate in form; and the center of curvature of the slot 24 is at a point defined by the center of contact by the rays R, from the source S, with the irradiated surface of the object It at a point of tangency with the focus circle 18. The support 22 is calibrated in degrees of arc to facilitate its use. A bed plate 26 has a means slidingly connecting it to the support 22, the latter means comprising a slide 28 which is located in the slot 24. It is preferable, although not essential, that the slide 28 depend from the lower surface of the bed plate 26, while the upper surface of the bed plate 26 is provided with a guideway 30 in which a carriage 32 is disposed, An assembly such as this should be precision made with substantially no lost motion and therefore the bed plate and carriage may be engaged by dovetail and slot, tongue and groove or over-resting flange 34 connections. Since a bracket 36 fastens the detector D to the carriage 32, any movement of the carriage causes a corresponding movement of the detector. Accordingly, in order to constrain the motion of the carriage 32 and hence the detector D to lie always facing the irradiated surface of the ob ject l6 and contacting the focus circle [8, a link 40 is pivoted at one end about a pin 42 as an axis, the axis being normal to the plane of the guideway 30, and is connected at a center, passed through the pivot pin 44. In operation an object to be subject of analysis is selected. The object l6 may be a small specimen which is easily moved, or, in use of the described apparatus, may be a stationary object, as a beam in a building or an extremely heavy casting such as an engine block. The source S is set into operation so that the rays traverse a diameter (Fig. 1) of the focus circle (or the focus sphere). The rays R strike the irradiated surface of the object H5 at points of near tangency and at the center point of actual tangency when the surface is normal to the irradiations. The rays are diffracted by the object and traverse a chord of the great focus circle l8 when observed in the plane of the circle. Maximum resolution of the defraction spectra is obtained regardless of the length of the chord by restraining the receiving slit 2!! to the circumference of the circle I8. The restraint of the slot 20 is accomplished by the presence of the link 40 which is pivoted at the center of the circle [8 and to the carriage 32. In as much as the carriage is mounted displaceably in the guideway 30 and the guideway has its longitudinal axis on a radius of the slot 24, no matter where the bed plate 26 is moved in its support 22, the detector D will always remain on the circle l8. By having the bed plate 26 and carriage 32 movable, but constrained in movement, diffraction at many angles, as indicated by the pointer 52, may be analyzed while the object l6 need not ever be moved. Such movement to observe spectra from any angle is indicated by the dotted line showing in Fig. 1. Although the arrangement in Fig. 2 includes the same elements as in Fig. 1, the source S in Fig. 2 is so located with respect to the object 16 that the incident rays R traverse a chord of the focus circle. The object [6 is placed at 45 to the incident rays R however, the object may be placed at any other angle to the rays which may be reasonably used. The requirement of tangency of the focus sphere with the object l6 enlarges the great focus circle, so that the slit l2 directs rays from the source S across a chord of the focus circle to strike the object at or very near the real point of tangency of the irradiated surface with the focus sphere great circle. In either the arrangement of Fig. 1 or 2, the constrained motion of the carriage is obtained in the same way. After the support is located, as by placing it on a table, and the source S rendered operative, the bed plate is moved to the desired position on the support, for example from the phantom line position of Fig. 1 to the full line position. The bed plate must move in an arc of a circle whose center is at the irradiated surface of the object 16 for reasons previously described. At the same time, the carriage 32 is slid in the gui eway 30 in such direction as to retain the detector D in contact with the focus circle 18, by the action of the link 40, one end of which has a fixed pivot at the center of the focus circle and the other end of which is pivotally movable on its pin 44. It should be understood, of course, that the foregoing disclosure relates to only a preferred embodiment of the invention and that numerous modifications or alterations may be made therein without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

        "Description": "Description The invention relates to a photodetector having enhanced back reflection thereby increasing the optical absorption and reducing the overall reflectivity of the device. The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. SERI XG-0-9372-1. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Photodetectors, such as a solar cell, having a thin active body, typically exhibit a conversion efficiency less than the maximum obtainable because the absorption coefficient of the body for light at a particular wavelength is too small. This effect is often compensated for by using for the back electrical contact to the body a material, such as metal, exhibiting high reflectivity so that the transmitted light is reflected back into the body. However, most contact materials do not efficiently reflect light at this interface. For example, in an hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cell such as that disclosed by Carlson in U.S. Pat. No. 4,064,521, incorporated herein by reference, a chromium metal contact reflects only about 25 percent of the light in the wavelength region range between about 0.6 and 0.7 micrometers (\u03bcm) and materials such as molybdenum and steel reflect even less light. An aluminium contact to the amorphous silicon body reflects about 73 percent of the incident light in this wavelength range but will cause degradation of the device performance if heated above a temperature of between about 100\u00b0 C. and 150\u00b0 C. Thus, it would be desirable to have a photodetector structure in which the absorption in the semiconductor body is increased and undesirable side effects such as degradation of the device performance upon heating are reduced. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The photodetector of the invention comprises a body including a semiconductor material having a semiconductor junction therein, a first electrical contact to a surface of the body through which light impinges on the body, a light transmissive and electrically conducting spacer layer overlying the opposed surface of the body and a light reflective electrical contact overlying the spacer layer. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGS. 1-5 are cross-sectional views of different embodiments of the photodetector of the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In FIG. 1, a photodetector 10 includes a light transmissive substrate 12, a light transmissive first electrical contact 14 overlying the substrate 12, a body 16 overlying the first electrical contact 14 and having a semiconductor junction 18 therein, a light transmissive and electrically conducting spacer layer 20 overlaying the body 16 and a light reflective second electrical contact 22 overlying the spacer layer 20. The body 16 includes a semiconductor material such as gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, cadmium sulfide, or single crystal, polycrystalline, or hydrogenated amorphous silicon. The body 16 may be formed by cutting a thin wafer from a boule of a single crystal material; depositing a layer of the material on a substrate by well known liquid or vapor phase epitaxial techniques or, in the case of amorphous silicon, by glow discharge techniques; such as are disclosed by Carlson in U.S. Pat. No. 4,064,521, with a substrate temperature between about 200\u00b0 C. and 350\u00b0 C. and preferably about 250\u00b0 C. For amorphous silicon the body 16 is typically between about 200 and 1,000 nanometers (nm) thick and preferably between about 300 and 600 nm thick. The semiconductor junction 18 includes any type of barrier which will cause electrons and holes generated by the absorption of light in the body to move in opposite directions. Thus, the semiconductor junction 18 may be a p-n junction with the portions of the active body on either side of the junction 18 being of opposite conductivity type. In FIGS. 2 and 3, where the indentification of the elements common to these FIGS. and to FIG. 1 is the same, two alternative embodiments of the semiconductor junction 18 are shown. In FIG. 2 the photodetector 30 includes a body 16 in which the semiconductor junction 18 is a Schottky barrier with the junction 18 occurring at the interface between a semiconductor region 32 of the body 16 and a thin metal region 34 which is also part of the body 16 and is adjacent to the first electrical contact 14. The region 34 is typically between about 5 and 10 nm thick and is composed of a metal such as platinum or palladium. In FIG. 3 the photodetector 40 includes a body 16 having an intrinsic type conductivity region 42 and regions of opposite conductivity type 44 and 46 thereby forming a p-i-n type semiconductor junction 18 across the region 42 of intrinsic conductivity type. The regions of opposite conductivity type 44 and 46 are typically between about 5 and 50 nm thick and are formed by adding an appropriate dopant gas to the glow discharge. Alternatively, these regions may be formed of a silicon-carbon alloy, such as that disclosed by Pankove in U.S. Pat. No. 4,109,271, incorporated herein by reference, or a silicon-nitrogen alloy. The intrinsic type conductivity of the region 42 is understood to include those cases where the region 42 has a small p or n-type conductivity either as a result of accidental contamination or intentional doping. If the intrinsic region 42 has a particular conductivity type it is preferred that it be of opposite conductivity type to that of the region 44 adjacent to the first electrical contact 14, thereby forming the semiconductor junction 18 at the interface between the regions 42 and 44. The substrate 12 through which light enters the body 16 is composed of a light transmissive material such as glass or plastic having sufficient mechanical strength to support the remainder of the structure. Typically, the substrate 12 is between about 1.5 and 6 millimeters (mm) thick. In FIG. 4 the photodetector 50 differs from the photodetector 10 of FIG. 1 in that the substrate 12 is replaced by a substrate 52 adjacent to the second electrical contact 22. Alternatively, the second electrical contact 22 and the substrate 52 may be combined into a single electrically conducting element sufficient to suport the remainder of the structure. The substrate 52 may be composed of a metal such as steel or copper about 1.5 mm thick. The photodiode 50 also includes a light transmissive protective layer 54 overlying the first electrical contact 14. The first electrical contact 14 is composed of a light transmissive material including a layer of transparent conductive oxide such as indium-tin oxide which is between about 80 and 300 nm thick. The layer of transparent conductive oxide may be deposited by electron beam evaporation, chemical vapor deposition, or by sputtering using techniques well known in the art. The second electrical contact 22 typically covers all, or almost all, of the surface of the spacer layer 20 and is preferably a material, such as a metal, which exhibits a high reflectivity in the wavelength range of the light which impinges on the contact after transmission through the active body 16 and the spacer layer 20 and is typically between about 100 and 500 nm thick. Preferably, the second electricaL contact 22 is composed of a metal such as aluminum, gold, copper, or silver which may be deposited by thermal or electron beam evaporation or sputtering. The spacer layer 20 is composed of a wide bandgap material which is substantially light transmissive in the wavelength range of the light which impinges on it and is also electrically conductive. This layer is typically composed of a transparent conducting oxide such as indium-tin oxide or tin oxide. The thickness of this layer is typically greater than about 5 nm and preferably greater than about 10 nm. Alternatively, the spacer layer 20 may be composed of a wide-bandgap semiconductor material which is light transmissive in the wavelength range of interest. A suitable material for the spacer layer 20 includes an amorphous silicon-carbon alloy such as that disclosed by Pankove in U.S. Pat. No. 4,109,271, or an amorphous silicon-nitrogen alloy. The silicon-carbon alloy may be deposited from a glow discharge containing silane and methane while the silicon-nitrogen alloy may be deposited from a discharge containing silane and ammonia. In this case the spacer layer has the same conductivity type as the region of the body 16 which it overlies in order to insure that a second semiconductor junction is not formed at the interface of the active body 16 and the spacer layer 20. Alternatively, the spacer layer 20 and the region 46 of the body 16 may be combined with a suitably doped spacer layer providing both the region of opposite conductivity type and the spacing function of the spacer layer. In either case the contact resistance should be less than about 1 ohm-cm2. There are two choices in determining the optimum thickness of the spacer layer 20. The first is to choose the thickness of this layer to be about one-half the wavelength in the spacer layer, or integral multiples thereof, of the light in the wavelength range of interest. Typically this thickness is between between about 75 and 350 nm. This choice removes the second electrical contact 22 from direct contact with the body 16 thereby eliminating the undesirable side effects of such direct contact for many useful materials. Optically, this choice for the spacer layer thickness is neutral at a particular wavelength in that it does not appreciably affect the reflectivity of the photodetector but at other wavelengths the reflectivity will be changed. The second choice is to select the thicknesses of the body 16 and the spacer layer 20 such that the reflectivity of the photodetector for light in the particular range of wavelengths is reduced and is preferably minimized. The optimal values of the thickness of the body 16 and the spacer layer 20 can be calculated using, for example, the matrix method as discussed in \"Optical Properties of Thin Solid Films\" by O. S. Heavens, Dover Publications, Inc., New York, 1965, p. 69. In the photodetectors of the invention the thickness of the spacer layer 20 is so related to the thickness of the body 16 and to the thicknesses of any other layers through which light passes and the optical constants of the second electrical contact 22, the spacer layer 20, the body 16 and any other layers through which light passes including the first electrical contact 14 and the substrate 12 that the reflectivity of the photodetector in a particular wavelength range is reduced and preferably minimized. Typically the thickness of the spacer layer is between about 10 and 200 nm. The photodetector formed when the thicknesses of the spacer layer and the body are chosen under these latter conditions is a light trapping structure in which light entering the photodetector undergoes multiple passes between the entry surface of the photodectector and the second electrical contact until it is absorbed by one of the layers. For a photodetector such as a solar cell which is preferably sensitive over a wide range of wavelengths extending from about 400 nm to 1000 nm, this structure is particularly useful since the detector is typically only weakly absorbing over a significant portion of this range of wavelengths. In particular, the hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cell disclosed by Carlson in U.S. Pat. No. 4,064,521 is weakly absorbing for wavelengths greater than about 600 nm. In such a case, the thicknesses of the spacer layer and the body may be chosen to minimize the reflectivity and maximize the absorption at a wavelength of about 650 nm. An anti-reflection condition is, however, typically not obtained since the absorption of the active body is weak. In FIG. 5 a series-connected tandem photodetector 60 incorporating the invention differs from the photodetector 40 of FIG. 3 in that a tandem semiconductor body 62 is interposed between the body 16 and the spacer layer 20. The tandem body 62 has therein a semiconductor junction which includes a region 64 of intrinsic conductivity type and oposed regions 66 and 68 of opposite conductivity type. The region 66 of the tandem body 62 and the adjacent region 46 of the body 16 are of opposite conductivity type with a tunnel junction therebetween. The tandem body 62 is typically composed of a material having a lower bandgap energy than that of the body 16 so that light which passes through the weakly absorbing body 16 is then absorbed in the tandem body 62. Typically, in a photodetector operating as a solar cell the body 16 is composed of hydrogenated amorphous silicon and the tandem body is composed of a hydrogenated amorphous silicon-germanium alloy deposited from a glow discharge containing silane and germane. The thickness of the spacer layer 20 may then be either one-half of a particular wavelength in the spacer layer or it may be chosen in conjunction with the thickness of the tandem body 62 and the body 16 and any other layers through which the light is transmitted such that the reflectivity of the photodetector 60 at a particular wavelength is reduced and preferably minimized. The relative thicknesses of the body 16 and the tandem body 62 and their compositions are adjusted so that the photo-generated electrical currents from each body are the same.",

        "Description": "Description RELATIONSHIP TO PRIOR APPLICATION This is a U.S. non-provisional application relating to and claiming the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/252,197, filed Oct. 16, 2009. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Physical contact optical fiber connectors are widely used in the communication industry. These connectors have one or more optical fiber physical contacts which are supported by ferrules which also physically align the contacts. These optical fiber physical contacts are often formed by polishing the end face of the optical fiber to a precise radius of curvature. A connector actually includes two connector halves which are intermatable. However, a connector half is often simply referred to as a connector. Thus, the single or multiple contacts are actually received within a connector half. When a corresponding connector half containing fibers and contacts are mated with the other connector half, the optical fiber contacts are brought together at their respective radii of curvature. If the intermated surfaces of the optical contacts are clean and undamaged, the contacts should have reasonably low insertion loss and small back reflection. In addition, it is important to correctly match these intermated optical contacts; for example, the corresponding intermated contacts must be correctly sized and aligned. Ideally, two fibers should be optically and physically identical and held by a connector that aligns the fibers precisely so that the interconnection does not exhibit any influence on the light propagation there through. This ideal situation is impractical because of many reasons, including fiber properties and tolerances in the connector. The ends of the fibers or contacts have been prepared by several methods, including scoring and breaking the fibers, as well as polishing the ends. Optical fiber connector contacts having very low back reflection become more important at higher data rates. The current practice to obtain low back reflection is to angle polish the physical contact. However, because of this angle, the connector must be keyed to have the proper orientation to mate with its corresponding angle-polished contact. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with one form of this invention, there is provided a fiber optic connector for use with a fiber optic network having at least one predetermined operating wavelength. A first housing containing at least one optical fiber is provided. The optical fiber has a free end forming a physical contact. The physical contact is coated with a protective film. The optical thickness of the protective film is at least 0.10 of the operating wavelength of the fiber optic network. In accordance with another form of this invention, there is provided a fiber optic connector for use with a fiber optic network having at least one predetermined operating wavelength including a first housing. The first housing contains at least one optical fiber. The optical fiber has a free end forming a physical contact. The physical contact is thermally shaped. The thermally shaped terminus is coated with a thin protective film. The optical thickness of the film is less than twice the operating wavelength of the fiber optic network, but is at least 0.10 of the operating wavelength. In accordance with yet another form of this invention, there is provided a method for manufacturing a fiber optic connector including providing a length of at least one optical fiber. The optical fiber has first and second free ends. The first free end forms a physical contact. A quick connect device is attached to the optical fiber wherein the physical contact projects from one end of the quick connect device and a portion of the optical fiber projects from the other end of the quick connect device thereby forming a termini. A vacuum is applied to the termini. The physical contact is coated with a protective film while the vacuum is applied. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The subject matter which is regarded as the invention is set forth in the independent claims.

FIG. 6 is a perspective view showing a fiber optic termini with a quick connect device which may be used in connection with the apparatus of the subject invention. FIG. 7 is a perspective view showing the quick connect device of FIG. 6 having been spliced to fiber optic cable. FIG. 8 is a perspective view showing an apparatus used in the manufacture of the optical fiber physical contacts of the subject invention. FIG. 9 is a sectional view showing one of the holes in the apparatus of FIG. 8 receiving a termini and a quick connect of FIG. 6. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring now more particularly to FIG. 1, there is provided optical fiber 10, having core 12 and cladding 14. There is also provided optical fiber 16, having core 18 and cladding 20. Fiber 10 is encapsulated by alignment ferrule 21 and fiber 11 is encapsulated by alignment ferrule 23. As will be discussed below, optical fibers 10 and 16 are mounted in corresponding connector halves which are designed to be intermated. Optical fiber 10 includes tip 22, which forms a physical contact. Optical fiber 16 includes tip 24, which forms a corresponding physical contact. These contacts 22 and 24 are preferably not angle polished, but preferably have coating thickness adjusted for low reflection and may be thermally shaped for additional reflection reduction. This thermal shaping may be done by various methods known to those skilled in the art, including the methods taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,413,450 and 6,738,554, both assigned to Megladon Manufacturing Group. The teachings of these two Megladon Patents are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Each physical contact 22 and 24 is coated with thin film 26, which is made of a hard material, i.e., a material having a Knopp hardness which is greater than the Knopp hardness of optical fibers. The preferred coating material is Al2O3, also known as corundum. Corundum is a very hard material, and thus resists scoring. Other hard coatings may also be used. Preferably this corundum film is thin enough so that light passing through is substantially unaffected, i.e., insertion losses are low but thick enough to resist scoring, and the optical thickness is adjusted so that reflection is low. For the embodiments in which a single layer of the film is applied, the thickness of film 26 should be at least 0.10 of but less than 1.00 of the operating wavelength of the light within the fibers. For embodiments in which multiple layers of film are applied, the thickness of the film can be as high as 2.00 of the operating wavelength of the light within the fibers. FIG. 2 shows a plurality of optical fibers 10 having physical contacts 22 all of which are mounted in connector body 28. Multi-fiber cable 30 extends from the rear of connector body 28. Preferably the embodiment of FIG. 2 utilizes quick connect optical fiber device as shown in FIG. 6 which are known to those skilled in the art such as the quick connect devices described in U.S. Patent Publication No. US2009/0060427 invented by Wouters. The teachings of the Wouters Patent Publication are hereby incorporated herein by reference. FIG. 6 shows termini 34 including quick connect device 37, optical fiber 10 and physical contact 22, physical contact is coated at the tip by corundum film 26. After coating, which is described below, termini 34 is placed in connector body 28, and optical fiber 10 is spliced to a corresponding optical fiber located within cable 30 by a splicing technique known to those skilled in the art. A spliced cable 30/termini 34 is shown in FIG. 7 with the splicing area indicated as item 35. Preferably, contact 22 has been thermally shaped, although the invention is not limited to a thermally shaped contact. It is preferred that corundum thin film coating 26 is applied to the contacts in a vacuum chamber using a coating process known to those skilled in the art. In embodiments in which the connector is terminated to a reel of optical fiber cable, if quick connect optical fiber termini are not used, the reel, which can be very large depending on the length of the cable, must be placed within the vacuum chamber which can be impractical and expensive. Using termini 34, individual termini may be placed in the vacuum chamber for disposition of the corundum coating application without the cable attached since the termini may be spliced onto the cable after coating of the film has taken place. A single layer vacuum coating run is expensive, and there could be several layers for the embodiment in which the film is used or an anti-reflective coating in addition to providing the hardware discussed above. In addition, each item will need to be rotated inside of the vacuum chamber during the coating process. By using the quick connect optical fiber termini approach, many more contacts can be coated at the same time with a single coating run, and/or a smaller vacuum chamber may be used, resulting in a substantial money savings. If the connector is terminated to a short patch cord(s) the quick-terminated optical fiber termini are not needed since a short patch cord(s) will easily fit into the vacuum chamber. During the coating process, it is important that only the tip 22 of the optical fiber be coated since the coating materials are very expensive and it would be wasteful to coat other parts of the termini. FIG. 8 illustrates a plate 36 which may be used to segregate the fiber tips 22 from the remainder of the termini during the coating process. Plate 36 includes a plurality of holes 38 which are adapted to receive termini 34 so that the tip 22 projects below the bottom of plate 36 and the remainder of the termini projects above the plate 36 as shown in FIG. 9. For illustration purposes only, a single termini is shown. In reality, it is preferred that each hole in plate 36 receives a termini for the sake of efficiency. Plate 36 is sized with a protective cover on the top of the plate within the vacuum chamber such that the coating occurs in the bottom of the plate, and only the tips 22 are coated. Plate 36 is also rotatable so that the coating is uniform. Once the tips 22 have been coated, termini 34 are removed from the plate and thus from the vacuum chamber and inserted into connector 28 as illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5. Termini 34 is spliced to optical fiber 40, which is received within cable 30, at splice region 35 using splicing techniques known to those skilled in the art, including techniques described in the Wouters patent publication. The hard corundum coating can be applied onto several layers of anti-reflective coating to also form a thicker hardened anti-reflective coating, which may in some instances eliminate the need for thermally shaping the contact. In some multi-layer embodiments, the outer layer may be hard corundum and the inner layers may be made of other low or high index of refraction materials having hardness closer to the glass fiber. This anti-reflective coating can be used for one or multiple wavelength bands of operation, including, but not limited to, the bands centered around 850 nm and 1,300 nm or 1,310 nm and 1,550 nm for example. The thickness of the anti-reflective coating depends on the number of layers of the film which are used. For example, the thickness might vary between 0.10 and 2.00 times the operating wavelength. However, where thermally shaping is used, the hardened coating further increases the hardness of the thermally shaped contact. Multi fiber circular connectors, such as the one shown in FIG. 2, are often used in harsh environments. Since such connectors must be keyed if the contacts are angle-polished, the contact orientations are hard to maintain. The combination of a hardened surface, scratch resistant contact and low back reflection without the need for keyed contact orientation is a great benefit for harsh environment multi-fiber circular connectors. The physical contact fiber end faces described herein are axially symmetric, rugged and have low back reflection and may be used with single or multi-fiber connectors. From the foregoing description of various embodiments of the invention, it will be apparent that many modifications may be made therein. It is understood that these embodiments of the invention are exemplifications of the invention only and that the invention is not limited thereto.",

US. Cl 73/67.7 Int. Cl GOln 29/04 Field of Search 73/675, Primary Examiner-James J. Gill Attorney-Robert D, Flynn ABSTRACT: An ultrasonic back reflection block having an entry surface receiving an ultrasonic wave from a surface of a material being tested, and a back surface reflecting the ultrasonjc wave in substantially the same direction as it is received from the entry surface. To check resolving power of the equipment, an artificial flaw\" is provided in the block, such as by forming a groove or the like in the back surface, to change the reflection characteristics of the block. PATENTEUJUN28I97I 3,587,300 ' sum 1 OF 3 v Fig |A Fig IB Fig IC- T'akashi FUJI BACK REFLECTIGN BLOCK FOR ULTIKASONIC FLAW DETECTIGN The present invention relates to improvements in ultrasonic inspection methods to detect internal and surface flaws of metal products, and more particularly to ultrasonic back reflection blocks to make stable and accurate detection irrespective of the quality, size and surface of the products to be inspected, without using an ultrasonic reference block. In the prior art, (such as disclosed in Journal of Metals, May I960, p. 392-). 397), the angle beam search method to detect discontinuities in a material has a wide range of applications such as inspection of the welds of metal plates, or laminations or surface discontinuities of tubes. in this prior art method, the result of detection is largely dependent upon the sensitivity of the transducer to the material. It has been, therefore, the standard practice to set up the sensitivity of a transducer by using an ultrasonic reference block. The block generally, according to the above-mentioned article in \"Journal of Metals, consists of a metal block containing several kinds of holes of specified size and depth. Generally speaking, the sensitivity of ultrasonic wave pulse echo equipment is indicated in such a manner that the height of the echo may amount to about 50 of that of the initial pulse. However, there is much difficulty involved in attaining stable results even with the above known ultrasonic units preadjusted at proper sensitivity. This is because of (l) the difference of properties between the reference block used for setting up the sensitivity and the material tested in actual practice, and (2) the substantial difference in the surface characteristics between the reference block and the material being tested. Generally speaking, surface characteristics of the reference block are quite good so that the ultrasonic wave is traced through the block without any trouble, while the surface of the test material is often rough so that the ultrasonic wave encounters difficulty travelling through the article. If the properties of the test material are different from that of the reference block, the predetermined sensitivity is changed, resulting in the danger of overlooking or erroneously reading the magnitude of discontinuities or flaws in the material. An object of the present invention is to provide an improved ultrasonic testing apparatus having good detecting characteristics for internal discontinuities in a variety of metal products, more particularly, in the weld of plates and tubings. Another object of the present invention is to provide a stable ultrasonic angle beam searching method irrespective of the differences of properties and surface characteristics of the test material from those of the reference metal block. Still another object of the present invention is to provide an improved ultrasonic testing apparatus which does not require use of a reference metal block. The sensitivity of the testing equipment is set up by directly operating on the metal product at starting of the actual testing. A further object of the present invention is to provide an improved ultrasonic testing apparatus having a smaller sized back reflection block which has a pulse travelling through the metal product reflecting perpendicularly to the back surface of the above block. The present invention allows the sensitivity to be set up by using an ultrasonic back reflection block instead of the reference metal block. The reflection echo is obtained by reflection from a flaw or reflection from the back surface of the reflection block. The invention will now be described in detail in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which: FIGS. lA-IC are various ultrasonic blocks of the present invention; FIG. 2A is a typical test set up illustrating the present invention in use; FIG. 2B is the pulse pattern of an input pulse and a reflec tion echo as shown on a cathode ty tube screen; FIG. 3A shows the present invention applied to flaw detection in a weld; FIG. 3B shows the pulse patterns for the apparatus of FIG. 3A; FIGS. 4A4D are side views of other embodiments of the present invention; FIGS. 5A-5D, respectively are top views of the embodiments of FIGS. 4A-4D; and FIG. 6 shows the pulse pattern of the input and reflection echos for the embodiment of FIG. 4A. FIGS. lA-IC show various kinds of ultrasonic back reflection blocks 6, 7, 8, with respective entry surfaces 6|, 7|, 81 and respective back reflection surfaces 62, 72, 82. FIG. 2A illustrates one example of the back reflection block in practical use, wherein an ultrasonic transducer I0 is positioned at one surface of the material) being inspected. At a predetermined distance therefrom the ultrasonic back reflection block 6 is placed. An ultrasonic pulse from the transducer I0 travels through the material 9 at a fixed angle with respect to its entry surface. The ultrasonic pulse, as indicated by the broken line, bounces back and forth between the entry surface and back surface of the material 9 being inspected. A portion of the pulse is transmitted via the contact surface 61 into the ultrasonic back reflection block 6. The ultrasonic pulse travels to the back surface 62 of block 6, is reflected perpendicular to the back surface 62 and travels back again to the starting point ofthe initial pulse at surface 6|. The reflected ultrasonic pulse is then fed into a cathode-ray tube screen and is displayed on its screen. FIG. 28 represents one example of the display on said screen, showing the initial pulse II and the back reflection echo pulse 52. The above is an experiment to explain the present inven tion. The actual practice for detection is explained as follows. FIG. 3A illustrates a material 9 to be inspected having a flaw 14 in a weld I3. A portion of the ultrasonic wave (or pulse) travelling through the article (shown as a broken line in FIG. 3A) is reflected from the flaw 14 before reaching the ultrasonic back reflection block 6 and is returned back to the transducer it). Therefore, the echo recorded on the cathoderay tube screen is higher than that reflected from the reflection face 62 of the ultrasonic back reflection block 6. FIG. 3B shows the relative height of these pulse echoes, designating 15 as the initial pulse, 16 as the flaw echo pulse of the weld and 17 as reflection echo pulse from the reflection face 62 of block 6. In this case, the sensitivity of the equipment is set up in such a manner that the reflection echo I7 is about half as high as the initial pulse 15. As is apparent from the above description, according to the present invention, the above sensitivity is not set up by means of comparison with the reference metal block, but is preset for the individually inspected materials themselves, so that the sensitivity will not be affected by properties and surface characteristics of the inspected material. Further, in the present invention, the resolution characteristics for the detection equipment can be observed, simultaneously with the echos, of sensitivity. That is, as indicated in FIGS. 4A FIGS. 5A, the back reflection block 6 is provided with an artificial flow 63 on the reflection surface 62. The flaw 63 is a groove in this embodiment. The block 6 is fixed on the material 9 to be inspected as indicated in FIG. 2A. Then, the transducer I0 is moved in the horizontal direction of FIG. 2A, resulting in a pattern on the screen of the cathode-ray tube similar to the one shown in FIG. 6. This pattern results due to the fact that the back reflection rate is lower on the groove 63 (i.e. the artificial flaw). The deeper the incision in the wave form of the pattern of FIG. 6 becomes, that is, the larger the value of h,/h, (FIG. 6) becomes, the better resolution characteristics the equipment shows. Thus, according to the present invention, it is easy to observe the performance and to observe weakening of the detector to be used. Thus, the present invention is of high utility and quite effective compared with the conventional method making use of a convention reference metal block. FIGS. SB-4C and 5B-5C show blocks having other types of artificial flaws. FIGS. 43 and 5B show a V-shaped groove 63, FIGS. 4C and SC show a groove 63 with a rough surface and FIGS. 4D and 5D show a hole 63 drilled through the block. These different blocks are used depending upon the particular application. The present invention can fully achieve the expected objects with very small sized ultrasonic back reflection blocks. The above described block, which shows satisfactory results, is very small, the length being 40 mm. and the width being It! mm. As a practical matter. any back reflection block will be satisfactory if it has large enough entry and back reflection the speed of sound material longitudinal wave transverse wuve acrylite 2.720 m/sec. 14st) m/sec. 5.880 m/sec. 331i) m/sec. mild steel According to the equation of sin 8,/ sin 6,=C,/ C, (C, and C, are the mean speed of sound within each material) regarding the refraction of a sound wave beam at the contact surface between the above-mentioned mild steel and acrylite, when 6, of mild steel is 70\", the refraction angle 6, of acrylite will be 50 30'. FIGS. lA-lC illustrate examples of back reflection blocks made on the basis of the above calculation. The block must be made to have the sound wave beam reflecting perpendicular to the back reflection surface, irrespective of properties of the block. Therefore, if this condition is satisfied, the back reflection surface may be flat 62 as shown in FIG. 1A, curved 72 as shown in H0. 18, or spherical 82 as shown in FIG. [C With these blocks, the back reflection echos appear as a rectangle, a straight line and a spot, respectively. They have their own characteristics and are properly used according to the objects of the detection in particular cases. There is no need of any special contact medium between the reflection block and the inspected material at all. In actual detection equipment according to the present invention, water, machine oil, water glass, coating agent, liquid binding agent and others were experimented with, all of which showed good results with good stability. As described in detail, the present invention provides an ultrasonic back reflection block of small size and light weight which is directly put on the material to be inspected. The blocks provide excellent resolution and sensitivity characteristics and is capable of stably and continuously inspecting material for flaws. The detection method was explained herein with reference to welded material, but it should be obvious that the present invention can be applied to all kinds of inspections, for example, for detecting internal discontinuities such as laminations, cracks, voids, or inclusions, and other flaws of plates, billets, bars, forgings, tubings, or the like.

Gill Attorney-Robert D, Flynn ABSTRACT: An ultrasonic back reflection block having an entry surface receiving an ultrasonic wave from a surface of a material being tested, and a back surface reflecting the ultrasonjc wave in substantially the same direction as it is received from the entry surface.

PATENTEUJUN28I97I 3,587,300 ' sum 1 OF 3 v Fig |A Fig IB Fig IC- T'akashi FUJI BACK REFLECTIGN BLOCK FOR ULTIKASONIC FLAW DETECTIGN The present invention relates to improvements in ultrasonic inspection methods to detect internal and surface flaws of metal products, and more particularly to ultrasonic back reflection blocks to make stable and accurate detection irrespective of the quality, size and surface of the products to be inspected, without using an ultrasonic reference block. In the prior art, (such as disclosed in Journal of Metals, May I960, p. 392-). 397), the angle beam search method to detect discontinuities in a material has a wide range of applications such as inspection of the welds of metal plates, or laminations or surface discontinuities of tubes. in this prior art method, the result of detection is largely dependent upon the sensitivity of the transducer to the material. It has been, therefore, the standard practice to set up the sensitivity of a transducer by using an ultrasonic reference block. The block generally, according to the above-mentioned article in \"Journal of Metals, consists of a metal block containing several kinds of holes of specified size and depth. Generally speaking, the sensitivity of ultrasonic wave pulse echo equipment is indicated in such a manner that the height of the echo may amount to about 50 of that of the initial pulse. However, there is much difficulty involved in attaining stable results even with the above known ultrasonic units preadjusted at proper sensitivity. This is because of (l) the difference of properties between the reference block used for setting up the sensitivity and the material tested in actual practice, and (2) the substantial difference in the surface characteristics between the reference block and the material being tested. Generally speaking, surface characteristics of the reference block are quite good so that the ultrasonic wave is traced through the block without any trouble, while the surface of the test material is often rough so that the ultrasonic wave encounters difficulty travelling through the article. If the properties of the test material are different from that of the reference block, the predetermined sensitivity is changed, resulting in the danger of overlooking or erroneously reading the magnitude of discontinuities or flaws in the material. An object of the present invention is to provide an improved ultrasonic testing apparatus having good detecting characteristics for internal discontinuities in a variety of metal products, more particularly, in the weld of plates and tubings. Another object of the present invention is to provide a stable ultrasonic angle beam searching method irrespective of the differences of properties and surface characteristics of the test material from those of the reference metal block. Still another object of the present invention is to provide an improved ultrasonic testing apparatus which does not require use of a reference metal block. The sensitivity of the testing equipment is set up by directly operating on the metal product at starting of the actual testing. A further object of the present invention is to provide an improved ultrasonic testing apparatus having a smaller sized back reflection block which has a pulse travelling through the metal product reflecting perpendicularly to the back surface of the above block. The present invention allows the sensitivity to be set up by using an ultrasonic back reflection block instead of the reference metal block. The reflection echo is obtained by reflection from a flaw or reflection from the back surface of the reflection block. The invention will now be described in detail in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which: FIGS. lA-IC are various ultrasonic blocks of the present invention; FIG. 2A is a typical test set up illustrating the present invention in use; FIG. 2B is the pulse pattern of an input pulse and a reflec tion echo as shown on a cathode ty tube screen; FIG. 3A shows the present invention applied to flaw detection in a weld; FIG. 3B shows the pulse patterns for the apparatus of FIG. 3A; FIGS. 4A4D are side views of other embodiments of the present invention; FIGS. 5A-5D, respectively are top views of the embodiments of FIGS. 4A-4D; and FIG. 6 shows the pulse pattern of the input and reflection echos for the embodiment of FIG. 4A. FIGS. lA-IC show various kinds of ultrasonic back reflection blocks 6, 7, 8, with respective entry surfaces 6|, 7|, 81 and respective back reflection surfaces 62, 72, 82. FIG. 2A illustrates one example of the back reflection block in practical use, wherein an ultrasonic transducer I0 is positioned at one surface of the material) being inspected. At a predetermined distance therefrom the ultrasonic back reflection block 6 is placed. An ultrasonic pulse from the transducer I0 travels through the material 9 at a fixed angle with respect to its entry surface. The ultrasonic pulse, as indicated by the broken line, bounces back and forth between the entry surface and back surface of the material 9 being inspected. A portion of the pulse is transmitted via the contact surface 61 into the ultrasonic back reflection block 6. The ultrasonic pulse travels to the back surface 62 of block 6, is reflected perpendicular to the back surface 62 and travels back again to the starting point ofthe initial pulse at surface 6|. The reflected ultrasonic pulse is then fed into a cathode-ray tube screen and is displayed on its screen. FIG. 28 represents one example of the display on said screen, showing the initial pulse II and the back reflection echo pulse 52. The above is an experiment to explain the present inven tion. The actual practice for detection is explained as follows. FIG. 3A illustrates a material 9 to be inspected having a flaw 14 in a weld I3. A portion of the ultrasonic wave (or pulse) travelling through the article (shown as a broken line in FIG. 3A) is reflected from the flaw 14 before reaching the ultrasonic back reflection block 6 and is returned back to the transducer it). Therefore, the echo recorded on the cathoderay tube screen is higher than that reflected from the reflection face 62 of the ultrasonic back reflection block 6. FIG. 3B shows the relative height of these pulse echoes, designating 15 as the initial pulse, 16 as the flaw echo pulse of the weld and 17 as reflection echo pulse from the reflection face 62 of block 6. In this case, the sensitivity of the equipment is set up in such a manner that the reflection echo I7 is about half as high as the initial pulse 15. As is apparent from the above description, according to the present invention, the above sensitivity is not set up by means of comparison with the reference metal block, but is preset for the individually inspected materials themselves, so that the sensitivity will not be affected by properties and surface characteristics of the inspected material. Further, in the present invention, the resolution characteristics for the detection equipment can be observed, simultaneously with the echos, of sensitivity. That is, as indicated in FIGS. 4A FIGS. 5A, the back reflection block 6 is provided with an artificial flow 63 on the reflection surface 62. The flaw 63 is a groove in this embodiment. The block 6 is fixed on the material 9 to be inspected as indicated in FIG. 2A. Then, the transducer I0 is moved in the horizontal direction of FIG. 2A, resulting in a pattern on the screen of the cathode-ray tube similar to the one shown in FIG. 6. This pattern results due to the fact that the back reflection rate is lower on the groove 63 (i.e. the artificial flaw). The deeper the incision in the wave form of the pattern of FIG. 6 becomes, that is, the larger the value of h,/h, (FIG. 6) becomes, the better resolution characteristics the equipment shows. Thus, according to the present invention, it is easy to observe the performance and to observe weakening of the detector to be used. Thus, the present invention is of high utility and quite effective compared with the conventional method making use of a convention reference metal block. FIGS. SB-4C and 5B-5C show blocks having other types of artificial flaws. FIGS. 43 and 5B show a V-shaped groove 63, FIGS. 4C and SC show a groove 63 with a rough surface and FIGS. 4D and 5D show a hole 63 drilled through the block. These different blocks are used depending upon the particular application. The present invention can fully achieve the expected objects with very small sized ultrasonic back reflection blocks. The above described block, which shows satisfactory results, is very small, the length being 40 mm. and the width being It! mm. As a practical matter. any back reflection block will be satisfactory if it has large enough entry and back reflection the speed of sound material longitudinal wave transverse wuve acrylite 2.720 m/sec. 14st) m/sec. 5.880 m/sec. 331i) m/sec. mild steel According to the equation of sin 8,/ sin 6,=C,/ C, (C, and C, are the mean speed of sound within each material) regarding the refraction of a sound wave beam at the contact surface between the above-mentioned mild steel and acrylite, when 6, of mild steel is 70\", the refraction angle 6, of acrylite will be 50 30'. FIGS. lA-lC illustrate examples of back reflection blocks made on the basis of the above calculation. The block must be made to have the sound wave beam reflecting perpendicular to the back reflection surface, irrespective of properties of the block. Therefore, if this condition is satisfied, the back reflection surface may be flat 62 as shown in FIG. 1A, curved 72 as shown in H0. 18, or spherical 82 as shown in FIG. [C With these blocks, the back reflection echos appear as a rectangle, a straight line and a spot, respectively. They have their own characteristics and are properly used according to the objects of the detection in particular cases. There is no need of any special contact medium between the reflection block and the inspected material at all. In actual detection equipment according to the present invention, water, machine oil, water glass, coating agent, liquid binding agent and others were experimented with, all of which showed good results with good stability. As described in detail, the present invention provides an ultrasonic back reflection block of small size and light weight which is directly put on the material to be inspected. The blocks provide excellent resolution and sensitivity characteristics and is capable of stably and continuously inspecting material for flaws. The detection method was explained herein with reference to welded material, but it should be obvious that the present invention can be applied to all kinds of inspections, for example, for detecting internal discontinuities such as laminations, cracks, voids, or inclusions, and other flaws of plates, billets, bars, forgings, tubings, or the like.

        "Description": "Description BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a back-reflection type light diffusing apparatus, and more particularly, to a back-reflection type light diffusing apparatus suitable for use in liquid crystal displays or in seeing through drawings. 2. Description of the Prior Art Generally, conventional back-reflection type light diffusing apparatuses for use in liquid crystal panel displays are formed of a light guiding plate having one surface which is formed into a light radiating surface and another surface onto which a light reflecting plate is mounted such that light is introduced from one or more positions at the peripheral end of the light guiding plate, and is radiated outwardly through one surface of the light guiding plate over its entire area on being reflected by the light reflecting plate mounted on the other surface thereof. The conventional back-reflection type light diffusing apparatuses, however, suffer a problem in that more light is radiated in the vicinity of the light emitting portions, and less light is radiated from areas which are distant therefrom which are therefore darker in other words, light cannot be radiated uniformly over the entire area of the light radiating surface. To obviate this problem, it has been proposed that the peripheral shape of the apparatus body 1 formed by a plate-shaped transparent member be modified, as shown in FIG. 1, in order to maximise the amount of light which passes through the central portion of the body. In the FIG. 1, reference numerals 2 and 3 respectively denote a light reflecting plate mounted around the sides of the body 1 and light sources. However, such apparatuses have a complicated configuration, and their light sources are only mounted at a limited number of positions. Further, the configuration of such apparatuses has to be determined by a cut-and-try method, and therefore changes depending on the number and positions of the light sources provided. In consequence, much time and labour are required to determine the configuration. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a back-reflection type light diffusing apparatus which is so improved as to radiate substantially uniform light over the entire light radiating surface thereof no matter how it is shaped, thereby eliminating the above-described problem of the prior art. To this end, there is provided a back-reflection type light diffusing apparatus formed by a light guiding plate having one surface which forms a first surface through which rays of light are radiated and another surface which forms a second surface on which light is reflected such that light which is illuminated from a predetermined light source located near the lateral end of the light guiding plate is introduced thereinto and is radiated by the light radiating surface, wherein the light reflecting surface is so distributed that the area thereof decreases the closer it becomes to the light source. In the back-reflection type light diffusing apparatus of this invention, rays of light introduced into the light guiding plate are diffused three-dimensionally, and are propagated by being repeatedly reflected by the first and second surfaces. Thus, light is reflected by the second surface in such a manner that it has a similar intensity over the entire second surface, since the light reflecting surface is so distributed on the second surface that the area thereof decreases the closer it becomes to the light source, thereby making it possible to radiate light substantially uniformly over the entire first surface. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a plan view of a conventional back-reflection type light diffusing apparatus; FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of an embodiment of a back-reflection type light diffusing apparatus according to the present invention; FIG. 3 is a schematic plan view of the back-reflection type light diffusing apparatus of FIG. 2; FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a light guiding plate constituting an essential part of the back-reflection type light diffusing apparatus; FIG. 5 illustrates the distribution of the reflecting surface and the non-reflecting surface of a light reflecting plate; FIGS. 6 to 10 show modifications of the displacement of the reflecting surface and the non-reflecting surface. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT An embodiment of the present invention will be described hereinunder with reference to FIGS. 2 to 5. Referring first to FIGS. 2 to 4, a light guiding plate 10 is formed of transparent plastic, and has a rectangular configuration. The light guiding plate 10 has one surface which forms a first surface 10A (the upper side as viewed in FIG. 2) through which light is radiated, and the other surface which forms a second surface 10B (the lower side as viewed in the same Figure) onto which a light reflecting plate 11 having a light reflecting surface 11A is mounted. The light guiding plate 10 is provided with a pair of notches 10D, 10D spaced at a predetermined interval from each other at one laterial end 10C thereof, and a light source 12 is disposed for illumination purposes, in each of the notches 10D, 10D. The other laterial end 10E of the light guiding plate 10 is also provided with a pair of notches 10F, 10F spaced at a predetermined interval from each other, and a light source 13 is disposed for illumination purposes in each of the notches 10F, 10F. The light reflecting plate 11, as shown in FIG. 5, is made of a light reflecting material, thereby providing a light reflecting surface 11A. The large number of circular portions of various sizes in this drawing represent those which have a small reflectivity of light (hereafter referred to as \"non-reflecting surface 15\"). The non-reflecting portions 15 may be formed by a coating of black or gray paint using a suitable method as is employed in forming thick films. The thus-arranged light reflecting plate 11 is mounted on the light guiding plate 10 in such a manner that the light reflecting surface 11A and the non-reflecting surface 15 are made to make direct contact with the second surface of the light guiding plate 10 (see FIG. 2), so that the light reflecting surface 11A and the non-reflecting surface 15 are formed on the second surface 10B of the light guiding plate 10. In the back-reflection type light diffusing apparatus of this embodiment, the area of the light reflecting plate 11 which is occupied by the non-reflecting surface 15 increases the closer it gets to the light sources 12 and 13 so that the ratio of the light reflecting surface 11A to the light reflecting plate 11 per unit area gradually decreases toward the light sources 12 and 13. More specifically, the non-reflecting surface 15 is so distributed on the second surface of the light guiding plate 10 that the area thereof decreases in proportion to the square of the distance from the light sources. A light reflecting plate 17 is mounted on the periphery of the light guiding plate 10 except for the notches 10D and 10F. A light diffusing filter 18 made of a frosted glass is secured to the light radiating surface 10A of the light guiding plate 10. Film coatings 19 made of a material which does not transmit light are provided at the portions on the surface of the light diffusing filter 18 which correspond to the positions of the notches 10D and 10F, so as not to radiate large amounts of light near the light sources. Operation of the back-reflection type light diffusion apparatus of the present invention will be described in detail. The light emanating from the light sources 12 and 13 located at the ends of the light guiding plate 10 moves back and forth in the light guiding plate 10 by being repeatedly reflected by the light reflecting plate 17 mounted on the periphery of the light guiding plate 10, and is diffused three-dimensionally. On the other hand, the non-reflecting surface 15 and the light reflecting surface 11A which are formed on the second surface of the light guiding plate 10 in a matrix work together and reflect light in such a manner that it has a substantially uniform intensity over the entire second surface before it is radiated through the light radiating surface 10A of the light guiding plate 10. The light radiating from the light radiating surface 10A passes through the light diffusing filter 18 of frosted glass which is mounted on the light radiating surface 10A. It is thereby scattered efficiently, and is radiated outwardly more uniformly as light illuminated from the surface illuminant which has few light and dark irregularities. The thus-arranged back-reflection type light diffusing apparatus of this invention brings about the following effects. If used in liquid crystal display panels, the apparatus provides a display which can be illuminated uniformly even at night, since uniform light is radiated from the light radiating surface 10A. If applied to a tracer's table by which drawings can be seen through, it can allow the device to be made smaller and adequately strong. The apparatus of the present invention need not have a complicated end configuration which is required by the conventional apparatuses. The end of the apparatus can therefore be shaped in any form. The distribution or size of the non-reflecting surface 15 mounted on the light reflecting plate 11 are not limited to those employed in the apparatus of this embodiment. It may also be distributed in any one of manners shown in FIGS. 6 to 10. In these Figures, the portions provided with oblique lines represent the non-reflecting surface 15 as in the case of FIG. 5, while the other portions indicate the light reflecting surface 11A. As is clear from these Figures, these surfaces are so distributed that the ratio of the light reflecting surface 11A per unit area decreases the closer it gets to the notches 10D and 10F. The apparatus of the present invention uses a rectangular light guiding plate 10. The present invention is not limited to this type of light guiding plate: a circular or square plate may also be employed. The light guiding plate 10 of the apparatus of this invention is made of transparent plastic. However, it may alternatively be formed of a translucent plastic, or a transparent or translucent glass. The apparatus of this invention is illuminated by four electric bulbs with two of them provided at each side. It may also adopt one electric bulb or two. Alternatively, it may adopt a fluoresent light or other light source disposed at both sides thereof, if it is to be applied to a device which is rather large in size. In such a case, the notches 10D and 10F need not be provided. The light guiding plate 10 may be formed of water contained in a plate-like vessel. In the apparatus of this invention, the light source can be installed at any position, and the non-reflecting surface 15 can be formed in any pattern on the light reflecting surface 11A by printing, or by coating plastic or evaporating a suitable metal. The light diffusing filter 18 can have an opal or any other predetermined color. As will be understood from the foregoing description, according to the present invention, substantially uniform light can be radiated over the entire light radiating surface no matter what shape the light guiding plate assumes.",

        "Description": "Description RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] The present application claims the benefit of priority of copending provisional patent application 60/241,327 filed on Oct. 18, 2000, which is hereby incorporated by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates generally to microoptical components, and, more particularly, to free space microoptical devices requiring a collimated input beam. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Many microoptical devices require a collimated input beam. Examples of such devices include free space microoptical switches (e.g. switches with movable micromirrors), multiplexers and demultiplexers. Typically, an optical fiber provides the light beam. Collimating the light beam requires a lens aligned with the fiber endface. [0004] In such devices, it is often desirable to have low back-reflection. Reflection of light into the fiber (e.g. light reflected from the fiber endface) can cause disturbances In optical devices (e.g. lasers) located upstream. It is a challenge to design a collimator that reflects a very small amount of light back into the optical fiber. SUMMARY [0005] The present invention provides optical fiber collimators and optical fiber beam directors having very low backreflection. The low backreflections is provided by a block attached to the endface of the optical fiber. The endface of the optical fiber is angled with respect to the optical axis of the device. And exit face of the block is perpendicular to the optical axis, so that the optical axis is straight throughout the device. The present invention can be used in free space optical switches, sensors, and other optical bench components.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0013] The present invention provides an optical fiber with a collimated beam having a very low backreflection. The present invention can be used in switches, multiplexers, demultiplexers or any other device where low backreflection is needed. In the present invention, the optical fiber has an angled endface, and a homogeneous block is disposed on the endface. The output face of the block is perpendicular to the optical axis of the fiber. Significantly, the collimated beam of the present invention is parallel with an optical axis of the optical fiber. [0014]FIG. 1 shows a side view of a collimated fiber array according to the present invention. The collimated fiber array has an optical fiber 20 disposed between V-groove chips 22 a, 22 b. The optical fiber 20 and V-groove chips comprise a fiber array 24. A endface 26 of the fiber array and optical fiber 20 is nonperpendicular with respect to an optical axis 28. The endface 26 is at an angle T with respect to a plane perpendicular to the optical axis 28. The angle T can be about 2-12 degrees, for example. Preferably, the angle T is great enough so that light reflected from the endface 26 is not coupled into the optical fiber 20. [0015] A transparent, homogeneous block 29 is disposed on the endface 26. The block has an entrance face 30 and an exit face 32. The entrance face 30 is angled at the angle T, so that a gap between the block 29 and endface 26 is relatively flat. The block 29 and endface 26 can be in contact, or can be attached by a thin film of transparent optical adhesive (e.g. epoxy). The exit face 32 is perpendicular to the optical axis 28. An antireflection coating (not shown) may be disposed on the exit face 32. [0016] The transparent block has a thickness 34. The thickness 34 is measured along the optical axis. The thickness 34 can be about 0.2 mm to about 5 mm, for example. The transparent block can be made of glass, silicon, or other transparent materials. The block 29 necessarily has a homogeneous index of refraction; it is not a graded-index (GRIN) lens. Preferably, the refractive index of the block matches the refractive index of the optical fiber core (typically about 1.46 for silica fiber). The transparent block can have a refractive index within about 5% of the index of the fiber core, for example, although refractive indexes outside this range are usable in the invention. [0017] A lens 36 is disposed in front of the block 29 and aligned with the optical axis 28. The lens maybe disposed on a lens substrate 38. The lens 36 and substrate 38 may be in contact with the block 29, or may be spaced apart, as shown. In the device shown in FIG. 1, the lens 36 is located so that a relatively collimated beam 40 is provided. It is noted that the optical axis 28 is parallel with the collimated beam and parallel with the optical fiber 20. This is significant in that it allows the beam 40 to be directed by mechanical connection to the fiber array 24. [0018] The lens 36 can be a refractive lens (as shown) or it can be a GRIN lens, holographic lens, or any other kind of lens. [0019] Finally, a light source 42 is connected to the optical fiber 20 at an input 41 so that light can be directed from the input 41, through the fiber 20, block 29 and lens 36, in that order. The light source can be a laser, waveguide, optical fiber or any other device that provides or directs light into the fiber 20. [0020]FIG. 2 shows a close-up of the optical fiber 20 and the block 29, illustrating the operation of the present invention. The chips 22 a, 22 b are not shown. The optical fiber 20 has a core 20 a and a cladding 20 b. An antireflection coating 44 is disposed on the exit face 32 of the block 29. [0021] Light 46 exits the optical fiber core 20 a and enters the block 29. A small amount of light (not shown) is reflected at the endface 26. Since the endface 26 is nonperpendicular to the optical axis 28, the reflected light is not coupled into the optical fiber core 20 a. Also, since the block 29 and optical fiber core 20 a have the same refractive indexes, the optical axis 28 is not bent by the fiber-block interface. [0022] Light 46 passes through the block 29 and exits the exit face 32. A small amount of light 48 is reflected by the exit face 32. The reflected light 48 diverges as it passes through the block 29. Therefore, when the reflected light reaches the optical fiber core 20 a, only a small amount is coupled into the fiber core. Most of the reflected light 48 misses the core 20 a and the fiber 20. This provides low backreflection for the collimator of the present invention. Since the reflected light 48 is divergent, increasing the block thickness 34 reduces the backreflection. [0023] The light 46 that exits the block 29 is aligned with the optical axis. [0024] The backreflection loss provided by the block 29 is in addition to backreflection loss provided by the angled endface 26, and the antireflection coating 44. The backreflection loss contribution of the block 29 can be approximately calculated from the following equation (assuming a Gaussian beam profile): Loss \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e due \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e to \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e Block = 4 4 + ( 2 \ue89e L Z R ) 2 [0025] Where L is the thickness 34, and ZR is the Rayleigh range of the beam in the glass block. L and ZR are expressed in the same units. For example, for single mode fiber (e.g. SMF 28) at a wavelength of 1550 nm, the Rayleigh range is about 76 microns. As a further example, backreflection reductions for certain block thicknesses are given in the table below. Backreflection attenuation for single mode fiber at 1550 nm Thickness 34 of block Backreflection reduction 1 mm 22 dB 2 mm 28 dB 4 mm 34 dB [0026]FIG. 3 shows an alternative embodiment of the present invention where the lens 36 is disposed on the exit face 32. In this case, an antireflection coating can be deposited over the lens surface. The embodiment of FIG. 3 proivides an accurate distance between the lens 36 and the fiber. [0027]FIG. 4 shows an embodiment of the invention having 5 optical fibers and 5 lenses 36 aligned with the fibers. Only the endfaces 26 a of the optical fibers are visible. A single block 29 is used for all 5 fibers, although several blocks could be used for individual fibers or small groups of fibers. The fiber array 24 has angled sides 50, 52 for engaging alignment pin 54. Similarly, alignment pin 56 is in contact with angled sides (not visible). The angled sides 50, 52 can be formed by anisotropic wet etching of silicon, for example, as known in the art of making mechanical-transfer optical fiber connectors. The pins 54, 56 extend through holes 58 in the substrate 38, thereby providing alignment between the fibers and the lenses 36. [0028] The present invention can be used in many different optical devices that require collimated beams with low backreflection. [0029]FIG. 5, for example, shows a top view of an optical crossbar 2\u00d72 switch according to the invention having flip-up micromirrors 60 for controlling collimated light beams 62 a 62 b. Light beams 62 come from collimators 64 a 64 b described herein. Mirrors 60 a, 60 b are lying flat, out of the light beam 62. Mirrors 60 c 60 d are in an upright position, and therefore reflect the light beams 62. Beams 62 are directed to output devices 66 a 66 b, which can be light detectors, filters, multiplexers, fibers or any other optical device. The collimators 64 provide collimated light beams that are simple to align with respect to the micromirrors 60. The beams are simple to align because the beams are parallel with the optical fibers 20. [0030] Although the collimator units are shown in FIG. 5 as discrete units (each with one fiber), an arrayed device as shown in FIG. 4 can be used so that all the beams are from a single device having several fibers and several lenses (and a single block 29). [0031]FIG. 6 shows an optical switch according to the present invention having tiltable micromirrors 70. The endface 26 is seen nearly edge-on in FIG. 6. An array of collimators 72 according to the present invention is directed at the tiltable micromirrors 70. The micromirrors can tilt to direct the beams 74 to output fibers 76 or other output devices (not shown). The lens 36 can be selected so that the beam if focused on the output device (e.g. fiber 76). [0032]FIG. 7 shows an optical nonreciprocal device (e.g. optical isolator, optical circulator) according to the present invention. Optical nonreciprocal devices typically require a light input device with very low backreflection. The present collimator can provide an optical beam for an optical nonreciprocal device such as an optical isolator. The low backreflection of the present device assures that the nonreciprocal device does not have backreflections arising from the optical fiber input. [0033] The present invention can be used with single-mode and multi-mode fibers. It is noted that the backreflection loss calculations will be different for single-mode and multimode fibers. [0034] Although the invention has been described using fibers disposed in V-groove chips, it is not necessary to use V-groove chips in the present invention. The optical fibers can be disposed in tubes or ferrules instead of V-groove chips. [0035] The block 29 can be made of many different materials including glass, plastic, semiconductors (e.g. silicon), and the like. The exit face 32 does not need to be precisely perpendicular to the optical axis 28; the exit face 32, can be a couple degrees off perpendicular from the optical axis 28, as an exit face 32 with precise perpendicularity can be difficult to manufacture. [0036] It will be clear to one skilled in the art that the above embodiment may be altered in many ways without departing from the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be determined by the following claims and their legal equivalents.",

        "Description": "Description Technical field of the invention [0001] The present invention relates to imagers that use one or more laser beams to expose material, e.g., for computer-to-plate (CTP) imaging to expose a printing plate. Background of the invention [0002] Back-reflection is a known problem with laser-based computer-to-plate imagers exposing a film or photopolymer plate. Note that imagers for imaging plates are also commonly called imagesetters. [0003] Many state of the art imagers are designed to process a wide variety of different plate types, not only from different vendors but also used for very different technical purposes. For example, Cyrel (TM) digital imagers made by Esko-Graphics NV of Gent Belgium, may be used for imaging film, imaging conventional polymer flexographic plates, and also imaging metal-backed polymer plates. Any one of these materials is referred to as a plate herein. Different types of plates typically might use different mechanisms to hold a plate onto the drum. Metal-backed plates for example, are preferably held onto the drum by permanent magnets embedded into the drum surface. Film plate and conventional computer-to-plate (CTP) polymer plates are preferably held onto the drum surface by vacuum, e.g., by vacuum applied from the inside of the drum to vacuum grooves and/or holes on the drum surface. An example of an apparatus for making a printing plate is disclosed in GB 2 223 984 A . [0004] In many ablative plate and film imagers, problems arise from laser light not being absorbed by the layer of laser-light-sensitive ablatable material, called the \"ablatable-layer\" herein. This unabsorbed light can be reflected by the drum surface back to the rear side of the plate or film. This can cause several problems. A first problem is that back-reflected light can start undesired ablation or uncontrolled vaporization of the remaining ablatable-layer on the front side of the plate or film. A second problem is that the grooves and/or magnets on the surface of the drum, that is, variations in the surface property of the drum will affect the amount of back-reflected light either because of the variations in the drum surface absorption or because of variations relative amounts of reflected light and scattered light. [0005] As an example of the second problem, suppose, for example, that image data is used that in a properly exposed plate would generate an image having a constant screen ruling. Suppose further that the grooves and/or magnets on the surface of the drum are regular structures. These structures cause changes of the back-reflected light, and as a result, instead of the image having a constant screen ruling, there may be, in addition, images that are similar to the regular variations on the drum surface caused by the grooves and/or magnets. [0006] One common workaround is to use a laser whose laser radiation has high divergence. One example of such a laser is a multi mode laser diode. In such a case, the light from the laser will diverge so strongly that the back-reflected beam is not likely to have sufficient energy density to cause any ablation or other effect on the ablatable layer of the plate. This approach however has the disadvantage that the depth of focus for such a laser beam is very small. Consequently, the distance between any focusing optics used to focus the beam, and the plate surface has to be accurately maintained at a constant level, either by use of high mechanical accuracy or by an automatic focusing systems. In either case, the solution is relatively expensive. [0007] Another solution is to use a use a drum whose surface is made from a material that absorbs radiation well. Unfortunately, most good absorbing materials such as black paint or anodized aluminium, might be, and likely will be ablated or discolored if exposed to a laser beam, so in time, the radiation absorbing property will be significantly reduced. Summary of the invention [0008] It is a general object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one disadvantage of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative. [0009] According to a fist aspect of the present invention, a method is provided, the method comprising exposing a plate on a support surface of an imager using one or more laser beams. The exposing is performed while there is a metallic screen structure located on the support surface between the plate and the support surface such that the amount of back-reflected radiation is reduced compared to the plate being placed directly on the support structure with no screen between the plate and support surface. [0010] The method is a method to reduce back-reflection during imaging, e.g. ablative imaging. [0011] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the screen structure may be made of a metallic material that is relatively resistant to laser radiation in the range of energy densities that would occur at the rear side of a plate during the imaging if no metallic screen structure was located on the support surface. According to some embodiments of the present invention, the screen structure may be made of a metallic material that is relatively resistant to laser radiation in the range of energy densities that would occur at the rear side of a plate during the imaging if no metallic screen structure was located on the support surface. [0012] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the imager may be a drum imager including a drum. The support surface may be the surface of the drum. [0013] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the imager may be a flatbed imager. The support surface may be the relatively flat surface of the flatbed imager. [0014] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the plate may include an ablatable layer. According to some embodiments of the present invention, the plate may include a film plate.

[0016] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the metallic screen structure may be attached to the support structure. [0017] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the support surface may have one or more vacuum grooves and/or holes to which a vacuum is applicable. The screen structure may have sufficient relative permeability to air, such that when a vacuum is applied to the vacuum grooves and/or holes, the plate may be maintainable on the combination of the support surface and the metallic screen structure thereon. [0018] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the screen structure may include nickel or a nickel alloy. [0019] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the screen structure may have a structure of between 24 and 79 holes per cm (60 and 200 holes per inch). Optionally, the screen structure may have a structure of between 43 and 55 holes per cm (110 and 140 holes per inch). [0020] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the screen structure may have a structure with a relative open area of approximately 25 to approximately 50 % of the overall area. [0021] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the screen structure may have a structure with relatively curved walls in the sides of holes. [0022] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the screen structure may have a structure closest to the back of the plate and parallel to the support surface that is relatively small. [0023] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the screen structure may have a surface that is relatively rough. [0024] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the screen structure may include one or more of nickel, iron, steel, brass, aluminum, copper, silver, gold, and/or platinum. [0025] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the screen structure may include a woven metallic fabric. [0026] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the screen structure may be made using a galvanic process. [0027] According to a second aspect of the present invention, an apparatus is provided, the apparatus comprising: a base structure including a support surface of an imager that uses one or more laser beams to expose a plate, the support surface configured to support a plate thereon; and a metallic screen structure located on the support surface between the plate and the support surface such that the amount of back-reflected radiation is reduced during imaging of the plate using the imager compared to the plate being placed directly on the support structure with no screen between the plate and support surface. [0028] The apparatus is an imager. [0029] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the screen structure may be made of a metallic material that is relatively resistant to laser radiation in the range of energy densities that would occur at the rear side of a plate during the imaging if no metallic screen structure was located on the support surface. [0030] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the apparatus may be a drum imager including a drum, wherein the support surface is the surface of the drum. [0031] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the apparatus is a flatbed imager and the support surface is the relatively flat surface of the flatbed imager.

The screen structure may have sufficient relative permeability to air, such that when a vacuum is applied to the vacuum grooves and/or holes, the plate is maintainable on the combination of the support surface and the metallic screen structure thereon. [0034] Particular and preferred aspects of the invention are set out in the accompanying independent and dependent claims. [0035] Although there has been constant improvement, change and evolution of devices in this field, the present concepts are believed to represent substantial new and novel improvements, including departures from prior practices, resulting in the provision of more efficient, stable and reliable devices of this nature. [0036] The above and other characteristics, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention. This description is given for the sake of example only, without limiting the scope of the invention. The reference figures quoted below refer to the attached drawings. Brief description of the drawings [0037] FIG. 1A shows in simplified form a perspective view of one embodiment of an external drum imager.

FIG. 3B shows the support surface of a drum with the sleeve of FIG. 3A on the support surface. FIG. 4A shows a perspective view including a cross-section through the grid of a rotary screen on a support surface according to one embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 4B shows a cross-section through the grid of a rotary screen on a support surface according to another embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 5 shows a simplified flowchart of a method embodiment of the present invention. [0038] In the different figures, the same reference signs refer to the same or analogous elements. Description of illustrative embodiments [0039] Described herein is a method and an apparatus that is operative to ensure a relatively low level of back-reflected laser radiation during exposure of a plate in a computer-to-plate imager that uses one or more laser beams for the exposure. Embodiments of the invention are applicable to both drum imagers and flatbed imagers. The description, however, is mostly of an embodiment for use in an external drum imager. How to modify for a flatbed imager would be clear and straightforward to one of ordinary skill in the art. [0040] FIG. 1A shows in simplified form a perspective view of one embodiment of an external drum imager 100, e.g., a computer-to-plate exposing imager that can include an embodiment of the present invention. The imager 100 includes a substantially cylindrically shaped drum 105 that is rotatable about an axis 113. The drum has a support surface on which a plate is placeable. The drum 105 and its support surface 103 is shown with a plate 107 wrapped around the drum's support surface 103. The imager 100 includes a laser and optical system, shown in simplified form as 109, generating a laser beam 111 that is modulated by image data provided by a computer (not shown). Many of the elements of the imager are not included in order to simplify illustrating the imager 100. As the drum 105 is rapidly rotated with the plate 107 on the surface 103 of the drum sleeve 105, the laser beam moves in a transverse (fast scan) direction 115 relative to the drum surface and this generates one or more exposed circumferential lines in the transverse direction perpendicular to the direction of the axis 113 of rotation. At the same time in one embodiment, the laser beam moves in the longitudinal (slow-scan) direction 116 parallel to the axis of rotation 113. Such exposing is commonly known for external drum scanners. [0041] In one embodiment, the drum 105 includes a set of vacuum grooves 119, with in one version, each groove forming a circular track around the circumference of outer surface of the drum 105. Other versions have the vacuum grooves arranged differently, and in all versions, the vacuum grooves, if present, are arranged to help maintain a plate on the outer surface by applying suction to the grooves. [0042] In another embodiment, vacuum holes rather than grooves are used. In yet another embodiment, a combination of grooves and holes is used. [0043] In one embodiment, the drum includes permanent magnets 117 embedded into the drum surface in order to help maintain a metal-backed plate on the outer surface. [0044] FIG. 1B shows in simplified form a perspective view of an alternate embodiment of an imager, this imager 150, e.g., a computer-to-plate exposing imager being a flatbed imager 150 that can include an embodiment of the present invention. The imager 150 includes a support structure 155 having a substantially flat support surface 153 on which a plate is placeable, such a structure 155 shown with a plate 157 on the surface 153. The imager 150 includes a laser and optical system in combination with a modulation system generating a laser beam 161 that is modulated by image data provided by a computer (not shown). As in FIG. 1A, many of the elements of the imager are not included in order to simplify illustrating the imager 150. A mechanism, either in the form of a rotating polygon, or a holographic system is used to case the laser beam to generate exposed lines in the transverse direction 165 substantially perpendicular to a longitudinal direction 166. The plate and beam are slowly moved relative to each other in the longitudinal direction 166. Such exposing is commonly known for flatbed scanners. The support surface 153 may also include a set of vacuum grooves and/or vacuum holes (not shown) arranged to help maintain a plate on the surface by applying suction to the grooves, and may further have a set of permanent magnets (not shown). [0045] The remainder of the description will be mostly for the drum scanner, e.g., as shown in FIG. 1A, and those in the art will understand how to modify the description for the flatbed configuration of FIG. 1B. Internal drum imagers also are known, and an embodiment of the invention also may be applicable to such an imager. [0046] FIG. 2 shows in simplified and enlarged form a cross-section near the support surface of an imaging drum or flatbed scanner. Suppose this is the surface 103 of the drum 105 of the drum scanner of FIG. 1A near the edge of the plate. Note that for simplicity, no curvature is shown. The plate 107 is assumed to be a polymer plate with a layer 203 of ablatable material. The plate is shown on the support surface 103 of the drum. The laser beam 111 is shown moving on the transverse (fast) direction 115 as a result of rotation of the drum. After traversing the cross-section of the plate, some of the beam 111 is back-reflected to back-reflected beams 205 from the surface 103, and as shown, some of this may expose the back of the ablatable material 203. It is desired to reduce or eliminate the back-reflected light 205 that can hit the back of the ablatable material 203. [0047] One embodiment of the invention is shown in the flowchart of FIG. 5 and includes in 503 attaching or placing a metallic screen structure on the support surface of the imager; and in 505 exposing a plate on the support surface of the imager using one or more laser beams while there is the metallic screen structure located on the support surface between the plate and the support surface, such that the amount of back-reflected radiation is reduced compared to the plate being placed directly on the support structure with no screen between the plate and support surface. [0048] The screen structure is made of a metallic material that is relatively resistant to laser radiation in the range of energy densities that would occur at the rear side of a plate during the imaging if no metallic screen structure was located on the support surface [0049] Another embodiment of the invention includes the support surface of the imager and a metal screen in sheet form that is modified to be on the support surface 103 of the imager, e.g., surface 103 of drum 105. FIG. 3A shows a substantially cylindrically shaped sleeve 301 made of a metal screen material and configured to fit over the imaging drum, e.g., drum 105 on the support surface 103. FIG. 3B shows the support surface 103 of drum 105 with the embodiment of the sleeve 301 of screen material on the surface 103. [0050] The screen material is also configured to be relatively permeable to air so that covering vacuum groves or holes such as grooves 119 does not substantially reduce the attractive forces of the vacuum to the plate. [0051] Experiments were performed using a sleeve 301 made from off-the shelf metal screen originally designed for another purpose-for rotary screen textile printing. Manufacturers of such screen material include Stork Prints B.V. of Boxmeer, the Netherlands, Saxon Screens Rotationsschablonen GmbH of Frankenberg, Germany; Saueressig GmbH + Co. of Vreden, Germany, and Rothtec Engraving Corporation, New Bedford, MA, USA. Such screens are typically made of nickel or a nickel alloy that the inventors have found is sufficiently resistant to laser radiation in moderate energy densities as would typically occur at the rear side of a polymer plate or film during exposure as a result of back-reflected radiation. Such screens have been found by the inventors to easily be attracted by the magnetic forces of a drum equipped with magnets such as magnets 117. Furthermore, the inventors found that such screen material is very permeable to air. For example, in some embodiments, the screen material has rhombic structures, and in other embodiments, honeycomb-like grid structures. The relative permeability to air makes it possible to cover vacuum groves or holes such as grooves 119 without substantially reducing the attractive forces of the vacuum to the plate. [0052] One embodiment the screen structure includes a woven metallic fabric. In another embodiment, the screen structure is made using a galvanic process. [0053] While off-the shelf screens manufactured for other purposes are usable, the inventors found that there are some properties that are even more desirable to reduce unwanted ablation by back-reflected laser radiation. [0054] One property is that the holes are not too wide so that the screen sufficiently reduces the back-reflected laser light during exposure. The inventors carried out initial tests with 24 holes per cm (60 holes per inch) and 49 holes per cm (125 holes per inch) and these worked well. Mesh of up to 79 holes per cm (200 holes per inch) work sufficiently well. Typically, a screen with between 43 and 55 holes per cm (110 and 140 holes per inch) is used. [0055] Another property is relative permeability to air. The inventors have found that screens with a relative open area of approximately 25 to approximately 50 % of the overall area are suitable, at a mesh range of between 24 and 79 holes per cm (60 and 200 holes per inch) work sufficiently well. [0056] Another property is relative roughness in order to reduce backscatter from the screen itself. The undesired effects of backscatter are based mainly on reflection. FIG.4A shows a perspective view including a cross-section through the grid of one rotary screen 403 on the support surface 103. The top surface 405 of the screen has a relatively large area parallel to the plate surface. FIG. 4A shows four example incident beams 411, 413, 415, and 417, and each incident beam's respective resulting reflected beam 412, 414, 416, and 418, respectively. As can be seen, because of the top surface 405 having a significant area parallel to the plate, the reflected beams 412, 416, and 418 are reflected straight back (shown almost parallel to the respective incident beam but at a slight angle in FIG. 4A for illustrative purpose) either from the top surface 405 or the drum surface 103. Such a screen allows a significant amount of light to be reflected back to the plate surface. [0057] FIG. 4B shows a cross section of an improved screen 421. The shape of the screen 421 is slightly modified from that of the screen 403 of FIG. 4A in a way that the main part of oncoming light is more or less scattered in various directions. In particular, the sides of walls of holes are relatively curved, e.g., more than the case of FIG. 4A in order to direct more of the incoming radiation into different directions. The flat part on top of the grid is also curved for the same reason and small compared to the structure of FIG 4A. That is, the screen structure has a structure closest to the back of the plate and parallel to the support surface that is relatively small. These properties result in a reduction of the direct back-reflection of the laser radiation propagating towards the surface of the drum. More of the radiation is reflected in a diffuse manner instead of being reflected in the direction of origin as is the case with the screen of FIG 4A. Furthermore, the opening between the bars has become smaller reducing the area of the drum surface which can directly reflect the incoming light, even though the % of the screen is the same. Consider again the four example incident beams 411, 413, 415, and 417, and each incident beam's respective resulting reflected beam 422, 424, 426, and 418, respectively. Reflected beams 422 and 426 are now less likely to cause a problem than the corresponding reflected beams 412 and 416 of FIG.4A. Reflected beam 418 could be problematic in both cases, being through the opening and from the support surface 103, and reflected beams 414 and 424 are not likely to cause back-reflection problems in both cases. [0058] As can be seen, because of the top surface 405 having a significant area parallel to the plate, the reflected beams 412, 416, and 418 are reflected straight back (shown almost parallel to the respective incident beam but at a slight angle in FIG. 4A for illustrative purpose). [0059] Such a structure as shown in FIG. 4B can be easily obtained from a structure such as shown in FIG. 4A by using a galvanic manufacturing process as is commonly used for nickel screen sleeves for textile printing. [0060] One embodiment uses a 49 holes per cm (125 holes per inch) screen made by a galvanic process to have relatively curved sides and relatively little flat area on the top surface. [0061] Those in the art will be familiar with many galvanic processes. One such process includes: 1. A copper cylinder being covered with an opaque material, e.g., a black ink-like material. 2. In a laser engraving machine, an image of a honeycomb-like structure in the size of the desired mesh being ablated from the cylinder. 3. In a galvanic solvent, nickel is accumulated to the areas on the copper cylinder revealed by the engraving process. 4. After the nickel screen which now has been built around the copper cylinder has reached a required thickness, the nickel screen is expanded by hot water and thus removed from the copper cylinder to result in a nickel sleeve. [0062] In one embodiment, the surface of the screen has a relatively rough surface rather than a relatively smooth surface. One embodiment includes etching the screen to result in a screen with a fine etched surface. [0063] While one embodiment uses a screen made from nickel, alternate embodiments may be made from any kind of metal and metal alloy that can be arranged in a screen or fabric structure. Different embodiments use one or more of nickel, iron, steel, brass, aluminum, copper, silver, gold, and/or platinum. [0064] While one embodiment includes exposing a plate on a rotating drum imager which has a screen structure thereon, another embodiment includes exposing a plate on a flatbed imager. [0065] While the discussion above mentions screens that are likely to have a regular structure, alternate embodiments use screens that do not have a regular structure. Similarly, the relative transparency of the screen need not be uniform, and so forth. Many variations are possible. [0066] Reference throughout this specification to \"one embodiment\" or \"an embodiment\" means that a particular feature, structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, appearances of the phrases \"in one embodiment\" or \"in an embodiment\" in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment, but may. Furthermore, the particular features, structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner, as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art from this disclosure, in one or more embodiments. [0067] Similarly it should be appreciated that in the above description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, various features of the invention are sometimes grouped together in a single embodiment, figure, or description thereof for the purpose of streamlining the disclosure and aiding in the understanding of one or more of the various inventive aspects. This method of disclosure, however, is not to be interpreted as reflecting an intention that the claimed invention requires more features than are expressly recited in each claim. Rather, as the following claims reflect, inventive aspects lie in less than all features of a single foregoing disclosed embodiment. Thus, the claims following the Detailed Description are hereby expressly incorporated into this Description of Example Embodiments, with each claim standing on its own as a separate embodiment of this invention. [0068] Furthermore, while some embodiments described herein include some but not other features included in other embodiments, combinations of features of different embodiments are meant to be within the scope of the invention, and form different embodiments, as would be understood by those in the art. For example, in the following claims, any of the claimed embodiments can be used in any combination. [0069] Furthermore, some of the embodiments are described herein as a method or combination of elements of a method that can be implemented by a processor of a computer system or by other means of carrying out the function. Thus, a processor with the necessary instructions for carrying out such a method or element of a method forms a means for carrying out the method or element of a method. Furthermore, an element described herein of an apparatus embodiment is an example of a means for carrying out the function performed by the element for the purpose of carrying out the invention. [0070] In the description provided herein, numerous specific details are set forth. However, it is understood that embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, structures and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to obscure an understanding of this description. [0071] As used herein, unless otherwise specified the use of the ordinal adjectives \"first\", \"second\", \"third\", etc., to describe a common object, merely indicate that different instances of like objects are being referred to, and are not intended to imply that the objects so described must be in a given sequence, either temporally, spatially, in ranking, or in any other manner. [0072] In the claims below and the description herein, any one of the terms comprising, comprised of or which comprises is an open term that means including at least the elements/features that follow, but not excluding others. Thus, the term comprising, when used in the claims, should not be interpreted as being limitative to the means or elements or steps listed thereafter. For example, the scope of the expression a device comprising A and B should not be limited to devices consisting only of elements A and B. Any one of the terms including or which includes or that includes as used herein is also an open term that also means including at least the elements/features that follow the term, but not excluding others. Thus, including is synonymous with and means comprising. [0073] Similarly, it is to be noticed that the term coupled, when used in the claims, should not be interpreted as being limitative to direct connections only. The terms \"coupled\" and \"connected,\" along with their derivatives, may be used. It should be understood that these terms are not intended as synonyms for each other.

        "Description": "Description CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit, under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/455,562, filed Mar. 19, 2003, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates, in general, to a method and apparatus for providing unidirectional emission from an etched laser cavity and for providing low back-reflection from photonic devices, and in particular to photonic devices coupled to the laser output. More particularly, the invention relates to V-shaped lasers and triangular ring lasers with etched gaps to control the unidirectionality of emissions at the outputs of the lasers by providing high side-mode suppression and to the use of an etched facet at or near a Brewster angle to minimize back-reflection in a photonic device. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Advances in current monolithic integration technology have allowed lasers of a variety of geometries to be fabricated, including V-shaped lasers and triangular ring lasers, as described, for example, in Applied Physics Letters, 59, pp. 1395-97, 16 Sep. 1991. These developments expand the prospective applications for integrated semiconductor lasers and add the attractiveness of greater manufacturability and reduced cost. This technology has opened the opportunity to explore new and novel features that can be combined inside and outside the laser cavity. Copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/226,076, filed Aug. 23, 2002, entitled \u0093Wavelength Selectable Device\u0094 and assigned to the assignee hereof, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, discloses monolithic structures that prevent back-reflection from the entrance facet of an element such as an electroabsorption modulator (EAM) into a laser cavity serving as a light source for the element by appropriate selection of the geometry of the device. Unidirectional emitting lasers would be desirable in such configurations to maximize the coupling of laser light into an EAM or other such elements. As is known, a ring cavity laser possess benefits that a Fabry-Perot cavity does not have; for example, a ring cavity will produce lasing action with higher spectral purity than can be obtained with a Fabry-Perot cavity. Monolithic triangular ring lasers as well as other types of ring lasers and their integrated couplings have been described in the prior art, as well as in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/918,544 filed Aug. 1, 2001, entitled \u0093Curved Waveguide Ring Lasers,\u0094 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,680,961, issued Jan. 20, 2004 and assigned to the assignee hereof, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In addition, unidirectional behavior in ring lasers also has been described in the prior art. Over the past few years, thanks mainly to the popularity of the Internet, the demand for bandwidth has experienced explosive growth. Carrier companies and their suppliers have addressed this demand by installing Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) systems which allow multiple wavelengths of laser light to be transmitted through a single strand of optical fiber. One of the main requirements of lasers used in WDM systems is that the laser sources have spectral purity, with the result that most of the power of the laser must be concentrated in a narrow wavelength range. A laser source has a large number of possible longitudinal modes, and although it has the tendency to operate in the one longitudinal mode that leads to the maximum gain, some other modes are also partially amplified, causing it to generate optical radiation in different wavelengths and reducing its spectral purity. The use of a gap for improvement of the spectral characteristics of a Fabry-Perot laser that operates with standing waves was proposed by Larry A. Coldren and T. L. Koch, \u0093Analysis and Design of Coupled-Cavity Lasers\u0097Part 1: Threshold Gain Analysis and Design Guidelines,\u0094 IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, Vol. QE-20, No. 6, pp. 659-670, June 1984. As described, a gap was introduced between two cleaved facets to achieve coupling between different cavities, resulting in an improved mode discrimination depending on the lengths of the cavities and the gap. However, due to the inherent difficulty in building accurately positioned cleaved facets and the tolerances involved in placing two cleaved cavities in close proximity to each other to form a gap, large-scale manufacture of these lasers did not materialize. Etched mirror and groove coupled devices were demonstrated by Larry A. Coldren, et al., in \u0093Etched Mirror and Groove Coupled GaInAsP/InP Laser Devices for Integrated Optics,\u0094 IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, Vol. QE-18, No. 10, pp. 1679-1688, October 1982. However, these etched facets where not equivalent in reflectivity to cleaved facets and the etched versions of these devices were less efficient than their cleaved counterparts. U.S. Pat. No. 4,851,368 taught a process that allowed etched laser facets to be fabricated that were equivalent in reflectivity to cleaved facets. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a new and novel technique for obtaining unidirectionality in semiconductor photonic devices such as ring lasers and in V-shaped lasers, based on the provision of an etched gap or gaps in such lasers, and more particularly to the position of such a gap or gaps with respect to the output facet in a ring laser or with respect to the length of the legs in a V-shaped laser. In addition, this invention is directed to the formation of semiconductor lasers with at least one etched gap to enhance the side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR); i.e., the difference between the power of the main laser wavelength and the side-lobes, in such lasers. Furthermore, the invention is directed to using a facet formed on photonic devices such as optical amplifiers, electroabsorption modulators, or the like at or near the Brewster angle to prevent back-reflection in such a device. In a preferred form of the invention, unidirectionality in semiconductor lasers is enhanced by forming at least one air gap in the laser cavity, or waveguide, with each gap being defined by spaced apart facets to enhance the side-mode suppression ratio in that cavity. The gaps are provided, for example, by etching through the cavity of a ridge-type ring or V-shaped laser which is integrally fabricated on the surface of a substrate. The gap or gaps may be etched in any leg of the laser cavity, and may be etched at 90\u00b0 to the laser axis or, alternatively, at an angle to the axis. In the latter case, the gaps may be etched in spaced-apart pairs, with the waveguide segment between the gaps being offset to compensate for refraction at the etched facets. In another form of the invention, when the laser output is coupled to a photonic device, back-reflection is minimized by the provision of a facet at the Brewster angle at the distal end of the photonic device. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The foregoing, and additional objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become evident from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, taken with the accompanying drawings, in which: FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of coupled monolithic structures arranged to prevent back-reflection from interfering with laser operation; FIG. 2 is a schematic illustration of a triangular ring laser cavity laser with two deep etched gap regions in accordance with the present invention; FIG. 3 illustrates a measured spectrum of the triangular ring laser of FIG. 2; FIG. 4 is a graphical illustration of the unidirectional behavior of the ring laser of FIG. 2; FIG. 5( a) to 5(f) illustrate basic configurations for a triangular ring cavity with etched gaps in accordance with the invention; FIGS. 6( a) and 6(b) illustrate double air gaps separated by (a) a flat angle facet air gap and (b) an angled facet air gap; and FIGS. 7( a) and 7(b) illustrate a V-shaped cavity with DBR reflectors (a) without air gaps and (b) with air gaps. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIG. 1 illustrates a photonic device in the form of a monolithic, unidirectional, triangular ring laser cavity 10 having legs 12, 14, and 16, with legs 12 and 16 joining at an exit facet 18. Unidirectionality is obtained in laser 10 by the provision of an external mirror 20, which reflects the clockwise light 22 propagating in the laser and emitted at exit facet 18 back into the laser to reinforce the counterclockwise light 24. A portion of the light 24 is emitted at facet 18 as beam 26, which is coupled into another photonic device 28 such as a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA), an electroabsorption modulator (EAM), or the like. In the illustrated arrangement, the device 28 is a V-shaped EAM which includes first and second legs 30 and 32 joined at respective first ends at an output facet 34, with the second end of leg 30 having an inlet facet 36 positioned to receive emitted beam 26, and the second end of leg 32 terminating at its extreme, or distal, end at a facet 38, which is at the Brewster angle to minimize reflectivity. As described in the aforesaid application Ser. No. 10/226,076, undesirable back reflection from an external device such as the photonic device 28 may be reduced by locating input facet 36 in such a way as to couple beam 26 into leg 30 while ensuring that any light 40 reflected from facet 36 will not be coupled back into laser 10. In this manner, the geometry of the device 28 with respect to laser 10 minimizes back coupling; however, this reduces the amount of light that can be coupled into the device 28. To maximize coupling of light from the laser to the modulator, direct coupling can be utilized, where the input facet of device 28 directly influences the performance of the laser, for example, by increasing reflectivity. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, back-reflection to a laser from a photonic element such as the EAM 28 is minimized by the provision, at the extreme distal end of the device 28, of a facet 38 at or near the Brewster angle. With this configuration, light 42, which is coupled into the device 28, propagates in leg 30 and strikes facet 34 below the critical angle to cause an output beam 44 to be emitted. Light 46, which is the portion of light 42 which is internally reflected at facet 34, propagates in leg 32, strikes facet 38, and is emitted as beam 48 instead of being internally reflected back. In this way, light in device 28 that is not emitted as output beam 44 will not reflect back into laser 10, and this will prevent excess chirp from being produced in the laser. For a complete discussion of modulator facet induced laser chirp, see, for example, \u0093DFB laser with attached external intensity modulator\u0094 by D. Marcuse, IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, Volume 26, Issue 2, Pages 262-269, February 1990. Although the laser described in FIG. 1 is a prior art unidirectional ring laser 10, it will be understood that a photonic device 28 with facet 38 at or near the Brewster angle can be coupled with a variety of other types of lasers. It will also be understood that the entrance facet 36 can be at perpendicular incidence to directly couple device 28 to the laser. Another aspect of the invention is illustrated in FIG. 2, wherein at least one gap is provided in a ring laser cavity 60, and wherein the size of such a gap and the lengths of the laser elements making up the cavity determine the spectral characteristics of the laser by improving its side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) and its unidirectionality. In the illustrated embodiment, the ring laser 60 is triangular, and includes legs 62, 64 and 66 joined at facets 68, 70 and 72. Facets 68 and 70 are fully internally reflecting, while facet 72 is an outlet facet which emits counter-rotating light beams 74 and 76. In the illustrated embodiment, two deep gaps 78 and 80 are etched completely through the leg 62, with each having a gap length LG. The length of the segment of leg 62 between facet 72 and gap 78 is identified as LA; the length of the segment of leg 62 between gap 78 and gap 80 is identified as LT; and the length of the segment of leg 62 between gap 80 and facet 68 is identified as LB1. The lengths of legs 64 and 66 are identified as LB2 and LB3, so the total length LB, or perimeter length, of the optical cavity is: LB=LA+LT+LB1+LB2+LB3+2LG The angle between legs 62 and 66 is selected so that output facet 72 has an angle smaller than the critical angle, and because of the gaps 78 and 80 in leg 62, the counterclockwise (left) output beam 74 is stronger than the clockwise (right) output beam 76. It will be understood that the output beam 74 may be directed to a suitable photonic device such as the EAM 28 of FIG. 1. The size of the gaps 78 and 80 and lengths of the various leg elements forming the ring laser cavity 60 determine the spectral characteristics of the laser. By adding a single gap such as gap 78, the laser cavity 60 is divided into two cavities coupled by an air interface. Using two gaps 78 and 80 separated by an intermediate cavity section LT divides the laser into three cavities: LA, LT, and the combination of LB1, LB2 and LB3, that are coupled successively by the gaps. An example of the spectral efficiency of such a device is illustrated in FIG. 3. In one form of the invention, the triangular laser cavity 60 is a monolithic ridge waveguide structure fabricated on an indium phosphide (InP) substrate 90, with a total length LB of 350 \u03bcm. The cavity is suitably biased, in known manner, to generate light, which will propagate in both the clockwise direction, indicated by arrow 92, and the counterclockwise direction, indicated by arrow 94. The legs 62 and 66 of the ring laser cavity meet at facet 72 at an angle 96 selected to produce an angle of incidence of about 12\u00b0 for light propagating in the cavity. To produce a high side-mode suppression output from the laser cavity, as well as unidirectional behavior, at least one air gap is provided in one leg of the cavity. In the illustrated embodiment, two air gaps are etched through cavity leg 62, each gap being about 3 \u03bcm wide, through, for example, photolithography and etching, with the gaps being separated by a cavity section LT of about 17.5 \u03bcm. These etched gaps produce interference between the cavity sections, which leads to the oscillation of one longitudinal mode in the laser cavity. This produces a side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of about 38 dB, as illustrated by curve 100 in FIG. 3, which is the measured spectrum of the light propagating in the counterclockwise direction to produce the output left beam 74. The etched gaps result in a substantially unidirectional emission of light from the cavity. As illustrated by the graphs 102 of FIG. 4, the left beam 74 light is about five times as intense as the right beam 76 light. The total length LB of the laser cavity can vary widely and preferably is between about 10 \u03bcm and 10,000 \u03bcm. Additionally, the number of gaps can vary, and preferably will be between 1 and 10 gaps positioned anywhere along the length of the ring laser cavity. Each gap preferably is between about 0.001 \u03bcm and about 10 \u03bcm in length and will extend completely through the cavity. FIGS. 5( a) to 5(f) illustrate examples of several possible configurations for ring lasers with etched gaps. In these examples, two gaps are used, although it will be understood that fewer or more gaps can be provided, as discussed above. In FIG. 5( a), a triangular ring laser 120 incorporates two gaps 122 and 124 in a left-hand cavity segment, or leg, 126, in FIG. 5( b) the gaps 122 and 124 are located in a bottom cavity segment, or leg, 128, of laser 120, and in FIG. 5( c) the gaps 122 and 124 are located in a right-hand cavity segment 130 of laser 120. FIGS. 5( c) through 5(f) illustrate laser cavity configurations utilizing an external photonic element such as a Bragg reflector (DBR) located adjacent the laser outlet facet. In FIG. 5( d), laser 120 incorporates gaps 122 and 124 in left-hand segment 126, and includes DBR element 140 aligned with arm 126 for reflecting the clockwise (right) beam 142 emitted by the outlet facet 144 of ring laser 120. In this case, the DBR device is located for reflection into the arm nearest the gaps and results in enhanced unidirectionality. In FIG. 5( e), the DBR device 140 is located for reflection into the arm farthest from the etched gaps, and thus is aligned with arm 130 to reflect the counterclockwise light emitted as beam 146 from facet 144. In this case, the SMSR is enhanced by this structure. FIG. 5( f) illustrates an embodiment wherein the DBR 140 is located for reflection into either arm 126 or arm 130 when the gaps 122 and 124 are located in the central arm 128. This structure is a compromise between increased SMSR and unidirectionality. Other configurations may also be provided, as by incorporating gaps in both the left and right arms, with or without DBR devices. Etched gaps, such as those illustrated at 78 and 80 in FIG. 2 and at 122 and 124 in FIGS. 5( a)-5(f) may be formed during the fabrication of the laser cavity in which they are located, or may be separately fabricated by etching the substrate before formation of the cavity or by etching the cavity after it has been fabricated. Such etching may be carried out using conventional photolithographic techniques for locating the gaps and for selecting their width. As illustrated in FIGS. 6( a) and 6(b), the ends of the gaps are defined by facets which the etching process forms in the laser cavity. Thus, for example, in the embodiment of FIG. 6( a), first and second gaps 150 and 152 are fabricated by etching away portions of a laser cavity or waveguide 154, and forming facets in the waveguide at ends 156 and 158 of gap 150 and at ends 160 and 162 of gap 152. These facets may be flat; i.e., at 90\u00b0 with respect to the axis 164 of the waveguide, in a preferred form of the invention. In the embodiment of FIG. 6( b), angled facets are formed at the gaps, in which case the adjoining waveguide segments are offset to compensate for the refraction of light at the interfaces of the laser cavity and the air gaps. In the illustrated embodiment, two air gaps 170 and 172 are provided in a waveguide 174, the air gaps dividing the waveguide into segments 176, 178 and 180. The ends of air gap 170 are formed by parallel angled facets 182 and 184 in segments 176 and 178, respectively, while the ends of air gap 172 are formed by parallel angled facets 186 and 188 in segments 178 and 180, respectively. The facets 182, 184 are angled in a direction opposite to that of facets 186, 188, and the centerline of waveguide segment 178 between the gaps is displaced from the centerline 190 of waveguide 174 to compensate for the refraction of light as it passes throughout the facets into the air gaps and then back into the waveguide. The displacement distance d is related to the angle of the facets with respect to the centerline and to the length l of the air gaps. The angled facets increase the efficiency of a unidirectional ring laser and improve the intensity of the desired output beam (the left beam in FIG. 2) with respect to the output beam being suppressed (the right beam in FIG. 2) by suppressing reflected waves over the traveling waves propagating in the laser cavity. Although two gaps are illustrated in FIG. 6( b), it will be understood that a different number of gaps can be provided. Further, it will be understood that the displacement of the cavity segments with respect to the centerline of the cavity may be established photolithographically in the laser fabrication process. Another embodiment of the invention is illustrated in FIGS. 7( a) and 7(b), wherein the ring-type laser discussed with respect to FIGS. 1-6 is replaced by a V-shaped laser cavity 200. The laser of FIG. 7( a) incorporates first and second legs 202 and 204 fabricated on a substrate at an angle 206 with respect to each other and intersecting at an outlet facet 208, from which light is emitted. The unidirectionality of the laser is established by the relative lengths of the legs 202 and 204. DBR reflectors 210 and 212 may be provided at the free ends of the legs 202 and 204, respectively, to reduce threshold currents and to provide improved performance. As illustrated in FIG. 7( b), unidirectionality in a V-shaped laser cavity 220 is enhanced by incorporating at least one air gap in one of the intersecting legs 222, 224 making up the cavity. In this embodiment, two spaced air gaps 226 and 228 are located in leg 222, with these gaps increasing the SMSR in the cavity to provide an improved unidirectionality at the output facet 230. As illustrated, this embodiment may also employ DBR reflectors 232 and 234 at the free ends of legs 222 and 224, respectively to improve its performance. The air gap structure of the present invention serves to significantly reduce, or prevent, back-reflection when a ring cavity or a V-shaped cavity laser is coupled to another photonic element, such as the EAM device described with respect to FIG. 1. Back reflection is further reduced by the use of a Brewster angle in the photonic element, as at the far end of the EAM in FIG. 1. Although the present invention has been illustrated in terms of preferred embodiments, it will be understood that variations and modifications may be made without departing from the true spirit and scope thereof as set out in the following claims.",

        "Description": "Description This invention relates to a connection between an optical fiber pigtail and a planar optical waveguide which has improved back reflection performance. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Planar optical waveguides are gaining increasing acceptance for various applications. In the manufacture of planar optical waveguides, a length of optical fiber, commonly referred to as a \"pigtail\", is attached to the planar optical waveguide. The pigtail is used during installation of the planar optical waveguide to connect the planar optical waveguide to other components, for example other planar optical waveguides, optical fiber, transmitters or receivers, in a system. Pigtails may be attached to components individually or in blocks containing a plurality of pigtails. The performance of system components can be degraded by optical reflections at connections, including the connection between the pigtail and the planar optical waveguide. The back reflection from the connection between the pigtail and the planar optical waveguide can result in optical power feedback to components such as lasers and other optical power sources. Although the acceptable level of back reflection depends on the protocols used and the network structure, system designers routinely specify back reflection performance of less than -50 dB for individual components. To reduce the level of back reflection, it is desirable to have a low reflectance connection between the pigtail and the planar optical waveguide. One method used to reduce the back reflection level is to include optical isolators in the system. However, optical isolators increase optical loss, cost and complexity of the overall system. In addition, optical isolators may introduce wavelength and polarization sensitivities into the system. Also, some recent experiments have shown that, even with the use of optical isolators, severe system degradation can occur in Gbit/second systems due to multiple reflections from connectors. Gimlett et al., \"Degradation in Gbit/s DFB Laser Transmission Systems Due to Phase-to-Intensity Noise Conversion by Multiple Reflection Points\", Electronics Letters, vol. 24, no. 7, pp. 406-408, 1988. Bevelling the endface of a fiber is primarily used in fiber-to-fiber connections. A problem with using a bevelled endface of an optical fiber in connecting a pigtail to an optical waveguide component is the subsequent requirement of orientation of the pigtail endface to obtain the best results. One orientation of the pigtail endface is shown in FIG. 2. In particular, without proper orientation, such a connection may be mechanically unstable, especially with respect to certain environmental exposures. This instability is generally caused by movement of the pigtail relative to the component which results from expansion of adhesives or gels used to attach the pigtail to the component, and is affected by the impact of the bevel orientation on adhesive or gel location. This instability is especially evident in situations where the bevel angle is larger (about 10\u00b0 or more) and the pigtail endface is parallel to the component endface as shown in FIG. 2. If the endfaces are parallel, the axial motion of the pigtail due to expansion mismatches may force the pigtail endface to move upward such that the optical axis of the pigtail is no longer optically aligned with the optical axis of the component. In addition, the pigtail may be forced upward by a rear adhesive drop (not shown) where the fibers are attached individually. Sufficient adhesive must be present on the upper edge of the pigtail to prevent movement. Limited spacing is allowed between the pigtail core and the component so as to minimize optical losses. Therefore, the bevel orientation affects the instability of the pigtail-to-component connection. For further information regarding the attachment of pigtails to components see, for example, Vial et at. U.S. Pat. No. 5,185,835. It is also possible to orient a bevelled pigtail endface such that it is in an open configuration with respect to the component, as shown in FIG. 2(b). This open configuration is more stable mechanically, as compared to the parallel configuration of FIG. 2, because of an approximate equilibrium in the volume of adhesive or gel above and below the point at which the pigtail endface is closest to the component and because the translation force is not as great. However, this open configuration increases the pigtail/component coupling loss due to angular beam deviation and is less stable during thermal tests because the index of refraction of the adhesive or gel varies dramatically with temperature, thus increasing losses caused by beam deflection. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of this invention to provide a robust connection exhibiting good back reflection performance between an optical waveguide component and an optical fiber pigtail. This connection should be relatively simple to fabricate and will provide good performance even after exposure to environmental conditions. In order to achieve this and other objects, when the pigtail is attached to the optical waveguide component, at least a portion of the pigtail end face which intersects the optical axis of the pigtail is angled with respect to a plane which is normal to the optical axis of the pigtail, and a portion of the endface of the optical waveguide component which intersects the optical axis of the component is angled with respect to a plane which is normal to the optical axis of the component. These angled portions should be large enough to include the core regions of both the waveguide component and the fiber pigtail, and, in fact, large enough to include the boundaries of the mode field transverse distribution, or the mode field diameter, of both the waveguide component and the fiber pigtail. In one embodiment of the present invention, the angled portion of the pigtail endface is oriented such that it is substantially parallel to the angled portion of the component endface. In another embodiment of the present invention, the pigtail endface is continuously bevelled to form a conical shape on the pigtail endface. This conical shape is formed such that the apex or point of the conical shape is not aligned with the optical axis of the pigtail. This \"offset cone\" forms a conical bevel which may be oriented to be parallel with the bevel on the component endface. Any light reflected back from the apex of the conical shape will be directed away from the core of the pigtail and will, therefore, not be reflected back through the pigtail to affect the system of which the component with the pigtail is a part. The conical shape can also be centered on the optical axis of the pigtail and then the tip of the conical shape is bevelled parallel to the component endface. In another embodiment of the present invention, the pigtail endface is wedge shaped in which a portion of the pigtail endface which intersects the optical axis of the pigtail is bevelled and oriented parallel to the component endface and the remainder of the pigtail endface is bevelled and open relative to the component endface. In another embodiment of the present invention, a block containing a plurality of pigtails is attached to a component which contains a plurality of optical waveguide paths. Additionally, the pigtail (or block) is attached to the component using an optically transmitting material, the refractive index of which substantially matches the refractive index of the component. The optically transmitting material can be an adhesive or a gel. A quantity of this material is applied between the pigtail and the component in line with the optical axes thereof. A second portion of this material may be applied on top of the portion of the pigtail adjacent the connection. This second quantity of material adds to the robustness of the connection during exposure to environmental conditions by restricting or eliminating movement of the pigtail.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Back reflection from the endface of an optical fiber pigtail is illustrated in FIG. 1(a). As shown in FIG. 1(a), pigtail 10 has a core region 11 and a perpendicular endface 12. If a refractive index mismatch exists at endface 12, Fresnel reflections will occur at endface 12. This is the case when the pigtail is a silica-based pigtail and adjacent endface 12 is either air or some material with a refractive index different from silica or doped-silica. These reflections are indicated by arrows 13. A portion of the Fresnel reflections from endface 12 returns into core region 11 of pigtail 10. This back reflection degrades system performance and may have deleterious effects on components attached to the opposite end of pigtail 10. FIG. 1(b) shows the effect of a bevelled endface on back reflections. Optical pigtail 20 has a core region 21 and a bevelled endface 22. If a refractive index mismatch is present at endface 22, Fresnel reflection will occur. But because of bevelled endface 22, the back reflection, indicated by arrow 23, will not return into core region 21, but will reflect into the cladding region of pigtail 20. Therefore, system performance will not be degraded by back reflection through core region 21. The angle \u03b1 should be at least 6\u00b0 to provide sufficient return loss of the back reflections. However, if the angle is only 6\u00b0, it requires a very high degree of polish on the endface surface. Therefore, it is preferred that the angle be about 10\u00b0 to ensure a sufficiently low reflectance of the endface. The natural approach to achieving a mechanically more stable connection is to orient the bevel of the pigtail endface in an open configuration, as shown in FIG. 2(b) where pigtail 30' with bevelled endface 31' is attached to component 32' with bevelled surface 34' such that bevelled endface 31' is open, i.e., not parallel, with respect to bevelled surface 34'. Optically transmitting material 33', which can be either an adhesive or a gel, is used to attach pigtail 30' to component 32'. Using this orientation, any axial force which is generated on the pigtail due to thermal expansion effects causes the pigtail to move closer to the component but does not affect the optical alignment of the pigtail with respect to the component unless the axial force continues after the edge of the pigtail has contacted the component endface. However, this orientation is less stable optically, as compared to a parallel orientation as shown in FIG. 2(a), because of the effect of beam deflection, and, therefore, coupling losses, of the temperature dependence of the optically transmitting material's refractive index. This orientation also degrades the pigtail/component coupling at room temperature because of the effect of beam deflection. While a connection in which the optical gap is made parallel, as illustrated in FIG. 2(a), may result in a less robust and mechanically stable connection, it does provide greater optical stability by minimizing the optical beam deviation or bending which results from the refractive index differences and which will increase the coupling loss. An optical pigtail 30 with a bevelled endface 31 is attached to an optical waveguide component 32 with bevelled surface 34 such that bevelled endface 31 is substantially parallel to bevelled surface 34. Optically transmitting material 33, which can be either an adhesive or a gel, is used to attach pigtail 30 to component 32. FIG. 3 shows an embodiment of the present invention in which only a portion 44 of endface 41 of pigtail 40 is bevelled. The portion 44 which is bevelled intersects with the optical axis 45 of pigtail 40 and is substantially parallel to the bevelled surface 46 of component 42. Adhesive or gel 43 is used to attach pigtail 40 to component 42. We have found that this partial bevelling of the pigtail endface produces a more mechanically stable connection as compared to a completely bevelled pigtail endface as shown in FIG. 2(a) while maintaining the optical stability benefits of the parallel optical gap. The increased mechanical stability results from the fact that the partially bevelled endface provides significant resistance to axial forces which may be generated by thermal expansion mismatch. According to the present invention, as shown in the embodiment of FIG. 3, the back reflections from the pigtail endface and the component surface are directed out of the plane which contains the optical paths of the pigtail and the component. This is preferred, particularly in the case of multiple pigtails attached to multiple paths of a component, to avoid the possibility of cross-reflection between the different optical channels. As the density of the channels increases, the possibility of cross-reflection may increase. To bevel a portion of the pigtail endface, a group of 80 to 100 fibers can be processed simultaneously in a flat ribbon configuration. Optical waveguide fiber is cut to the desired pigtail length, for example, 5 meter lengths. This can be accomplished by using a fiber reel with a 1.6 meter diameter, wrapping optical waveguide fiber around the reel, and cutting the fiber to produce lengths of 5 meters. The pigtails are then assembled in a holder which arranges the pigtails in a flat ribbon orientation. The upper surface of the holder in contact with the pigtails is coated with a polyurethane film which prevents movement of the pigtails during the bevelling process. After being placed in the holder, the portion of the pigtails which extend out of the holder are cut to 30 mm lengths. The holder is then placed in a polishing machine for endface flattening, which is accomplished using a rotating polishing disk with a grit size of 10 to 15 \u03bcm which contacts the pigtail endface. Once the endface is flat and has no scale, the holder is oriented to an angle of 10\u00b0 relative to the rotating polishing disk. The polishing disk is changed to a grit size of 0.3 \u03bcm and a bevel is formed on a portion of the pigtail endfaces. In order to ensure that the bevelled portion of the endfaces is large enough to include the core regions of the pigtails, and in fact, is large enough to include the boundaries of the mode field transverse distribution, or the mode field diameter, of the pigtails, the bevelled portion should cover more than half of the endface, or about 70 to 80 \u03bcm for a singlemode fiber pigtail as measured from one edge of the endface. The roughness of the pigtail surface is preferably less than about 1 \u03bcm. After polishing, the pigtails are cleaned with alcohol on the exposed 30 mm. The coating on the end 4.5 mm of the pigtails is removed by chemical stripping. The pigtails are now ready for attachment to the optical waveguide component. The portion of the component endface is prepared as follows. The component endface is formed by machining the component with a diamond blade with a grit size between 3 and 20 \u03bcm. The component is then held in a polishing machine such that the polishing tool makes an angle of about 10\u00b0 relative to the component endface. The polishing machine operates by making an alternating movement with a frequency of between 10 and 100 Hz. An abrasive paper of various grit sizes is used to prepare the component endface. The preferred condition of the component endface is an angle of about 10\u00b0 relative to a plane which is normal to the optical axis of the component. The bevelled portion should extend about 40 \u03bcm from the top surface of the component to ensure that the bevelled portion is large enough to include the core region of the component, and in fact, is large enough to include the boundaries of the mode field transverse distribution, or the mode field diameter, of the component. It is preferable that the rugosity, which is a measure of the roughness, of the bevelled portion of the component endface be about 100 nm or less. To achieve the desired condition of the component endface, the component endface is first polished with a grit size of 9 \u03bcm until the bevelled portion of the component endface extends about 35 \u03bcm from the top surface of the component. The grit size is then reduced to 0.3 \u03bcm, and the polishing continues until the bevelled portion extends to 40 \u03bcm from the top surface of the component. The total duration of the polishing cycle is about 4 minutes. Another method for forming the parallel bevelled portions will be described in relation to FIG. 7. Block 80 contains at least one pigtail 81 and is attached to component 82 by adhesive or gel 83. The optical axes of the pigtail and component (not shown in FIG. 7) are aligned prior to attachment. Cutting blade 84 has a cutting surface 85 which is approximately 22 \u03bcm in thickness. Cutting blade 84 is oriented to about 10\u00b0 relative to a plane which is normal to the optical axes of the pigtail and the component. The cutting blade is then brought into contact with the block-component combination such that a bevelled surfaces 86 and 87 are formed on a portion of both the component 80 and the pigtail 82, respectively. Because these bevelled surfaces are made with the same cutting operation, they are essentially parallel to each other. The cutting operation does not disturb the alignment of the block relative to the component. The pigtail endface can have a double bevel formed thereon as shown in FIG. 4. As illustrated in FIG. 4, pigtail 50 has a core region 51 which has an optical axis 52. On the end of pigtail 50, first and second bevelled surfaces 53 and 54 are formed. First bevelled surface 53 includes the entire core region 51 of the pigtail, and second bevelled surface 54 does not intersect any portion of the core region 51. Back reflections from bevelled surface 53 are not returned through core region 51 of pigtail 50. Bevelled surface 53 of pigtail 50 is substantially parallel to bevelled surface 56 of component 55. Adhesive or gel 57 is used to attach pigtail 50 to component 55. FIG. 5 shows an end-on view of a pigtail 60 which has a conical shape 61 formed on an endface such that conical shape 61 is centered on the optical axis (not shown) of pigtail 60. To prevent back reflections from the apex (not shown) of conical shape 61, a portion 62 of conical shape 61 is bevelled. A method for forming a microlens on the end of a fiber is disclosed in Mitch U.S. Pat. No. 4,818,263. Through the process disclosed in Mitch, the microlens is precisely centered on the optical axis of the fiber. Mitch states that this precise centering on the optical axis of the fiber provides for dramatic improvement of coupling efficiencies. There is no disclosure or suggestion in Mitch that the microlens may be offset from the optical axis of the fiber. In fact, Mitch even discloses offsetting the microlens from the physical axis of the fiber in the even that the optical axis is offset from the physical axis. If the lens is not centered on the optical axis of the fiber, then the lens function is weakened. Also, there is no disclosure or suggestion in Mitch regarding the impact on back reflection of a microlens formed by the process disclosed therein. To form a substantially conical shape on a pigtail, the pigtail is rotated and advanced toward a rotating grinding disk. By applying force to the pigtail while it is rotating it and in contact with the disk, the conical shape is formed. The grit size of the abrasive on the disk is advantageously in the range of 1 to 3 \u03bcm. The force on pigtail 70 is between 10 and 50 grams. The polishing time is between 2 and 5 seconds. To form a bevel on a conical shape, as shown in FIG. 5, the conical shape is formed by simultaneously rotating a pigtail and a grinding disk and advancing the pigtail endface toward the disk, then stopping the rotation of the pigtail while continuing to advance the pigtail endface toward the disk to form the bevelled portion. Although the examples described herein are relative to individual pigtails, the present invention is equally applicable to configurations in which multiple pigtails are attached to a component in a block or ribbon as shown in FIG. 6. A block 70 containing 8 pigtails 71 is connected to a component 72 containing multiple waveguide paths 73. Also, although the bevelling on the component has been shown as requiring the removal of a portion of the top surface of the component, a bevelled surface 92 can be formed on the component 91 by cutting a notch 94 into the endface of the component, as shown in FIG. 8. Bevelled endface 95 on pigtail 90 is formed and is substantially parallel to bevelled surface 92 of component 91. However, these embodiment is not preferred because of the possibility of chipping occurring at the sharp edge 93, which is at or near the optical axis of the component. Also, the examples herein have shown the bevelled endfaces and surfaces as substantially planar. However, the bevels may be curved as shown in FIG. 9, provided that the local tangents 104 and 105 at the optical axes 102 and 103 of the pigtail 100 and component 101, respectively, are substantially parallel to each other. The present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to the preferred embodiments thereof, however, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made in the form and details of these embodiments without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the following claims.",

        "Description": "Description BACKGROUND This invention relates generally to optical networks, and particularly to systems that have a plurality of optical components with interfaces between waveguides. Waveguides are formed in solid substrates. One waveguide may be aligned with a second waveguide, such that their axes are nearly on the same straight line. Customarily, a face of each waveguide is polished at an oblique angle to the axis of the waveguide. As a result, light reflected from the interface with the second waveguide is not coupled back to the first waveguide. Thus, in a variety of situations, there are interfaces between successive optical elements such as waveguides, fibers, and fiber ribbons. At each interface it is desirable to prevent back reflections. The interfaces may be formed by a cut transverse of the length of an optical component to abut with an ensuing component. Thus, for example, an optical fiber ribbon may be cut transversely to its length to form a transverse edge that abuts with another optical component at an interface. In order to prevent back reflection by forming the oblique angle at the interface, the transversely severed edge is polished to form the desired angle that prevents back reflection. Thus, multiple operations are needed, increasing the cost of forming an appropriate reflection suppressing interface. Therefore, there is need for better ways to form interfaces between optical elements. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is an exploded top plan view of one embodiment of the present invention; FIG. 2 is an exploded side elevational view of the embodiment shown in FIG. 1; FIG. 3 is an exploded top plan view in accordance with the prior art; and FIG. 4 is an exploded side elevational view of the prior art. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Referring to FIG. 1, an optical system 10 may include a series of abutting optical elements 12 a, 12 b, and 12 c (the gaps 20 between elements 12 being exploded in the figures). Light may be transmitted serially from one element 12 to the next element 12 in line. As a result, optical interfaces 20 are formed between successive, abutting optical elements 12. To prevent back reflections as indicated by the arrow A in FIG. 1, the surface 22 of mating elements 12 (such as the elements 12 a and 12 b) may be cut at an angle \u03b8 with respect to perpendicular to the axes or lengths of the abutting elements 12. The actual cut that forms the surface 22 may be made transversely to the plane of the substrate 14 of each optical element 12 but at an angle to the length of the element 12. In other words, the cut is made transversely to the plane of the substrate 14, while still creating a tapered surface on each optical element 12 by angling the perpendicular cut to the optical axes of the abutting elements 12. As shown in FIG. 2, in one embodiment, a waveguide 16, such as fiber ribbon, may be positioned at the edge of a substrate 14. The surfaces 22 may be cut transversely to the upper surface of the waveguide 16 and transversely to the plane of the substrate 14, facilitating the formation of the cut. After the cut has been made at the angle \u03b8, the resulting surface 22 may be polished. In contrast, referring to FIG. 3, with the prior art, cuts are made at a non-perpendicular angle to the plane of the substrate 14 and the upper surface of the waveguide 16. As a result, back reflections are prevented, but an oblique cut must be made through the material. This oblique cut requires more complex manufacturing techniques, increasing the expense of the resulting process. Thus, as shown in FIG. 4, an angled surface 22 a is defined, but it was defined by a cut that extends at an oblique angle through each element 12. It is considerably easier to cut transversely to the plane of the optical element 12 and simply to do so at an angle relative to the length or optical axis of the optical element 12. While the present invention has been described with respect to a limited number of embodiments, those skilled in the art will appreciate numerous modifications and variations therefrom. It is intended that the appended claims cover all such modifications and variations as fall within the true spirit and scope of this present invention.",

Conventionally, light exiting the optical fiber inside an optical coupler of the ROSA encounters a refractive index mismatched interface, e.g. fiber/air, causing a portion of the light to be reflected directly back into the fiber. To minimize back reflections at the interface with the optical fiber, an optical insert is provided having an index of refraction matching that of the optical fiber, thereby moving the mismatched interface remote from the end of the fiber to an interface of the optical insert and a lens, to which the optical insert is attached.",

        "Description": "Description CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The present invention claims priority from U.S. Patent Application No. 60/489,440 filed Jul. 23, 2003, which is incorporated herein by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a receiver optical sub-assembly (ROSA), and in particular to a ROSA with reduced back reflection. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Back reflection is a source of optical noise and the reduction of the level of back reflection is necessary for optimizing performance of the ROSA. Moreover, some communications standards, e.g. SONET, require that the receiver optical back reflection be less than specified limits, e.g. \u221227 dB. In a conventional ROSA 1, illustrated in FIG. 1, a photo-detector 2 is mounted on a substrate 3, along with other electronic circuitry, such as a trans-impedance amplifier 4. Electrical leads 6 extend outwardly from the rear of the ROSA 1 for electrically connecting the electronic circuitry to a transceiver circuit board (not shown). The substrate 3 is mounted in a container, such as a transistor outline (TO) can 7, which in turn is mounted in a housing 8. The housing 8 also encloses a ball lens 9, used to focus an optical signal from an optical fiber (not shown) onto the photo-detector 2. An optical connector 11 is connected to the housing 8 using a mounting collar 12. The optical connector positions an end of the optical fiber proximate the lens 9. To reduce back reflection, a fiber stub 15 is provided inside the optical connector 11 for mating with the optical fiber. The fiber stub has and angled output end for tilting the beam so that reflections from the photo-detector 2 are not coupled back into the optical fiber. Unfortunately, the conventional structure of FIG. 1 includes several small requiring a complicated assembly process. Moreover, the cores of the optical fiber and the fiber stub 15 must be accurately aligned or large coupling losses result. An alternative to the ROSA assembly of FIG. 1 is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,302,596 issued Oct. 16, 2001 in the name of Cohen et al, and illustrated in FIG. 2. A fiber connector 21, a housing 28 and a lens 29 are all integrally molded into a single unit, generally indicated at 30. An optical signal exits the end of the optical fiber and passes through air in a recess 32 to the lens 29, which focuses the optical signal onto a photo-detector at normal incidence. The recess 32 is provided as a \u0093dust collector\u0094 to prevent dirt or other foreign materials from contaminating and being imbedded into the plastic interface surface 33. This ROSA design greatly simplifies the assembly process; however, the problem of back reflection still exists. The main sources of back reflection occur at the perpendicular optical fiber-to-air interface and from the surface of the photo-detector. Since the optical fiber input must have a perpendicular end face, there is a need to suppress the \u00984% back reflection. An object of the present invention is to overcome the shortcomings of the prior art by providing a relatively simple ROSA assembly with limit back reflection. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, the present invention relates to a receiver optical sub-assembly device for converting an optical signal into an electrical signal comprising: an optical coupler for holding an end of an optical fiber, which transmits the optical signal; a photo-detector for converting the optical signal into an electrical signal; a lens disposed between the optical coupler and the photo-detector for focusing the optical signal onto the photo-detector; an electrical connector electrically connected to the photo-detector for transmitting the electrical signal to a host device; and an optical insert coupled to the lens inside the optical coupler for contacting an end of the optical fiber when disposed therein, the optical insert having an index of refraction substantially the same as the optical fiber, whereby substantially no light is reflected at an interface of the optical insert and the optical fiber, and whereby any light reflected off an interface of the optical insert and the lens will have expanded by such an amount to greatly reduce any light coupling back into the optical fiber. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The invention will be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings which represent preferred embodiments thereof, wherein: FIG. 1 illustrates a side view of a conventional ROSA; FIG. 2 illustrates a side view of a conventional one piece ROSA; FIG. 3 illustrates a side view of a ROSA according to the present invention; FIG. 4 illustrates a side view of another embodiment of a ROSA according to the present invention; and FIG. 5 illustrates a side view of another embodiment of a ROSA according to the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION With reference to FIG. 3, the ROSA assembly, generally indicated at 41, according to the present invention includes a molded plastic one-piece front-end unit 42 defining an optical connector 43, a housing 44, a focusing lens 46, and a mounting collar 47. The front-end unit 42 is constructed from an optical grade plastic, e.g. ULTEM1010. A substrate 48 is fixed to the mounting collar 47 for supporting a photo-detector 51 and other electronic devices, i.e. trans-impedance amplifier 52. Electrical leads, preferably in the form of flexible electrical cable 53, transmit electrical information to and from the photo-detector 51 and the other electronic devices, e.g. trans-impedance amplifier 52. The substrate 48 provides a stiffener for the flexible electrical cable 53. In a preferred embodiment, the substrate 48 is transparent to optical signal 56, thereby enabling the optical signal 56 to pass therethrough to the photo-detector 51. The photo-detector 51 is flip-chip mounted to the trans-impedance amplifier 52, which is mounted to the substrate 48. A recess 57 is provided in the rear surface 58 of the substrate 48 for receiving the photo-detector 51 suspended therein, whereby an outer edge of a front face of the trans-impedance amplifier 52 is attached to a shoulder formed on the rear surface 58 around the recess 57. Alternatively, the recess 57 could extend all the way through the substrate 48, enabling the optical signal 56 to pass unobstructed to the photo-detector 51. To limit back reflections as the optical signal 56 exits the optical fiber, an index-matching optical insert 60 is mounted on a front surface 61 of the focusing lens 46. The optical insert 60 has an index of refraction closely matching that of the optical fiber. Preferably, the optical insert 60 is a rectangular or cylindrical block of silica, BK7, or Borosilicate float glass. Ideally the optical insert 60 is fixed to the front surface 61 using an index-matching adhesive, preferably having an index of refraction midway between the index of refraction of the optical insert 60 and the index of refraction of the plastic front end unit 42. Alternatively, the optical insert 60 can be mounted to the front surface 61 by some other means, such as press fitting. Ideally the optical insert 60 projects outwardly into the cavity 62 of the optical connector 43 forming a trough 63 therearound. The trough 62 will provide an area for collecting any dust or foreign particles entering the cavity 62 to prevent this material from being embedded into the optical insert 60. Since the optical fiber is silica based, the reflection at the optical fiber/optical insert 60 interface is negligible. The difference in refractive index at the optical insert 60/plastic lens 46 interface does result in a small amount of back reflection. However, as is illustrated in FIG. 3, the optical signal 56 expands prior to hitting the front surface 61, and continues to expand as it is reflected back to the optical fiber. Accordingly, the overlap between the back reflected light and the optical fiber mode is relatively small, i.e. only a small fraction of the optical signal 56 is reflected back to the optical fiber. To reduce the back reflection even further, the size of the optical insert 60 can be increased beyond the usual 0.8 mm length. In another embodiment of the present invention illustrated in FIG. 4, the ROSA assembly, generally indicated at 71 includes the same one-piece molded front-end unit 42, defining the optical coupler 43, the housing 44, the focusing lens 46, and the mounting collar 47. Similarly, the optical insert 60 is fixed to the front surface 61 in the cavity 62 defining the trough 63 therearound. A flex ring substrate 72 is connected to the mounting collar 47, and supports a rear face of a trans-impedance amplifier 73 on a mounting face 75 thereof. A photo-detector 74 is flip-chip mounted onto the trans-impedance amplifier 73, and a flexible electrical cable 76 electrically connects the trans-impedance amplifier 73, inter alia, to a transceiver circuit board (not shown). In this case the flex-ring substrate 72 can be constructed out of a material with high thermal conductivity, i.e. >100 W/m\u00b0 K, e.g. zinc, aluminum, which enables the ROSA 71 to run at higher operating temperatures before thermally induced noise becomes a factor. To further reduce back reflections, the photo-detector 74 is mounted at a non-normal angle to the incoming optical signal 56, so that any reflected light will not be reflected directly back through the lens 46. The mounting face 75 is at a nominal angle of between \u22124 and \u221210\u00b0, preferably \u22127\u00b0, from a plane normal to the incoming optical signal 56. The flex-ring substrate 72 includes a mounting ring 72 a for attachment to the mounting collar 47. In another embodiment of the present invention illustrated in FIG. 5, the ROSA assembly, generally indicated at 77 includes a similar one-piece molded front-end unit 78, defining the optical coupler 43, the housing 44, and a focusing lens 46. The mounting collar 47 is replaced by a slightly larger mounting sleeve 79. Similarly, the optical insert 60 is fixed to the front surface 61 in the cavity 62 by the index-matching adhesive defined above defining the trough 63 therearound. A photo-detector 80 is mounted on a trans-impedance amplifier 81, which is mounted on a substrate 82. Electrical leads 83 extend from the rear of the ROSA 77 for electrically connecting the electronic circuitry to a transceiver circuit board (not shown). The substrate 82 is mounted in a container, such as a transistor outline (TO) can 84, which in turn is mounted in the mounting sleeve 79 of the housing 44. Preferably, a flat or tilted (\u22124\u00b0 to \u221210\u00b0) transparent, e.g. glass, window 86, as shown in outline, with an Anti-Reflective coating is provided to hermetically seal the TO can 84. The photo-detector 80 could also be mounted at a slight angle, as shown in outline, to further reduce back reflections.",

        "Description": "Description\u00a0\u00a0(OCR text may contain errors) Suppression of Back Reflection in a Waveguide Field of the Invention The invention relates to waveguides. More particularly, but not exclusively, the invention relates to the suppression of back reflections of radiation in a waveguide used in a spectrometer. Background of the Invention Waveguides are used to guide electromagnetic radiation from one component of a device to another or to guide radiation within a component. One example of device which utilises a waveguide is a spectrometer. Spectrometers are used in many applications for measuring properties of light across a range of wavelengths. For example, a spectrometer can be used for compositional analysis, by obtaining absorption or emission spectra for an object of interest. The presence and location of peaks within the spectra can indicate the presence of particular elements or compounds. Spectrometers are commonly used for analysis at optical wavelengths, but can also be used at other wavelengths such as microwave and radio wavelengths. Spectrometers are typically relatively complex and expensive devices that require the alignment of a number of moving parts to be controlled with high precision. For example, a typical spectrometer may focus light onto a diffraction grating to split an incident beam into separate wavelengths, and the diffraction grating may be rotated to a specific angle to direct light of a particular wavelength towards a detector. In recent years chip-based spectrometers have been developed which can be highly miniaturised, have no moving parts, and can be manufactured using well-established lithography techniques. An example of such a spectrometer-on-a-chip is shown in Figure 1. The chip spectrometer 100 comprises a substrate 110, onto which are patterned a waveguide 120 and a plurality of disk resonators 130 coupled to the waveguide. Light enters the waveguide at a first end 120a and is guided towards a second end 120b. The resonators are arranged such that portions of the light in the waveguide are coupled into the disk resonators 130. Each resonator 130 is arranged to support a resonant mode at a particular wavelength such that only light of that wavelength is coupled into the resonator 130. On top of each disk resonator 130 is an electrode 140 for detecting current that is proportional to the amount of light present in that resonator. The current detected in each resonator therefore indicates the amount of light at that wavelength that was present in the input beam of light. Each electrode 140 is further connected to a signal bond pad 150 for connecting the spectrometer 100 to an external device for measuring the current. A portion of the light is not coupled into any of the resonators and reaches the second end 120b of the waveguide. Back-reflections from the end of the waveguide may give rise to interference within the spectrometer chip which degrades the performance of the spectrometer. A low reflective coating 160 is therefore evaporated or sputtered onto the second end 120b of the waveguide to stop back-reflections from light reaching the end of the waveguide. However, the application of the low reflective coating requires an additional processing step in the manufacture of the spectrometer. The invention aims to improve on the prior art. Summary of the Invention According to the invention, there is provided a structure for guiding electromagnetic radiation, comprising: a substrate; a waveguide provided on the substrate and having a first end for receiving electromagnetic radiation and a second end; and an anti-reflection region provided at the second end of the waveguide on the substrate, the length and the width of the anti-reflection region being optimised to suppress back reflection of radiation that reaches the second end of the waveguide. The back reflection in the waveguide is reduced as a result of the radiation becoming unguided as it enters the anti-reflection region where the diverging radiation field is absorbed by the material forming the anti-reflection region. By optimising the length and the width of the anti-reflection region, an effective reflectivity of almost 0% can be achieved. The waveguide and the anti-reflection region may be formed from the same material. The waveguide and the anti-reflection region may be integrally formed as a single component. They may be provided on the substrate in the same processing step. The waveguide and the anti-reflection region may be provided as part of the same layer. If the waveguide comprises more than one layers, the waveguide and the anti-reflection region may provided as part of the same layers. The layers may include a quantum well. The anti-reflection region may have a width substantially wider than a width of the waveguide. The anti-reflection region may further have a width substantially greater than a wavelength of the radiation in a material from which the anti-reflection region is formed. When the anti-reflection region is formed from the same material as the waveguide, the wavelength is also the wavelength of the radiation in the waveguide. For example, the anti-reflection region may have a width of at least 3 times the wavelength of the radiation in the material from which the waveguide and the anti-reflection region are formed. The structure may be a semiconductor based structure and the anti-reflection region may have a width of at least 3 times the wavelength of the radiation in the semiconductor waveguide. More specifically, the wavelength based on which the dimensions of the anti-reflection region is determined is not the free-space wavelength but the wavelength in the material from which the waveguide and the anti-reflection region is formed. The anti-reflection region may have a length substantially longer than a wavelength of said electromagnetic radiation in a material from which the anti-reflection region is formed. When the anti-reflection region is formed from the same material, the wavelength is also the wavelength of the radiation in the waveguide. The anti- reflection section may have a length of typically at least 5 times the length of the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation. Of course, the longer the anti- reflection region, the greater the proportion of radiation that is not back-reflected. When the waveguide and the anti-reflection region are formed from a semiconductor material, the wavelength of the radiation in the waveguide would be the wavelength of the radiation in the semiconductor material. According to the invention there is provided a photonic component comprising the structure as described above. According to the invention, there is also provided a chip comprising the structure as described above. According to the invention, there is also provided a spectrometer comprising the structure described above. The spectrometer may further comprise a plurality of resonators provided on the substrate and coupled to the waveguide. The plurality of resonators may be disk resonators Brief Description of the Drawings Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to Figures 2 to 6 of the accompanying drawings, in which: Figure 1 is a perspective diagram of a prior art spectrometer; Figure 2 is a perspective diagram of a spectrometer with a waveguide arrangement according to some embodiments of the invention; Figure 3 is a plan view of the waveguide arrangement according to the invention; Figure 4 shows a cross-section of the waveguide arrangement of Figure 3; Figure 5 illustrates a propagating continuous wave pattern in the waveguide arrangement according to the invention; Figure 6a is a graph showing how the radiation intensity at a particular location in the waveguide varies with time; and Figure 6b indicates the location in the waveguide where the intensity of radiation is monitored for the graph of Figure 6a. Detailed Description With reference to Figure 2, a perspective view of a spectrometer 200 with a waveguide arrangement according to some embodiments of the invention is shown. The spectrometer is a spectrometer-on-a-chip comprising a substrate 210, onto which are patterned an elongate waveguide 220 and a plurality of disk resonators 230 coupled to the waveguide. The waveguide can be arranged to receive and guide electromagnetic radiation of a predetermined range of wavelengths, including but not limited to optical, microwave or radio wavelengths, and may be a ridge waveguide. Light is received at a first end 220a of the waveguide and is guided towards a second end 220b, and each resonator 230 is arranged to support a resonant mode at a particular wavelength such that only light of that wavelength is coupled into the resonator 230. On top of each disk resonator 230 is an electrode 240 for detecting current that is proportional to the amount of light present in that resonator. The current detected in each resonator therefore indicates the amount of light at that wavelength that was present in the input beam of light. Each electrode 240 is further connected to a signal bond pad 250 for connecting the spectrometer 200 to an external device for measuring the current. It should be realised that although the resonators are described as separate from the waveguide, the resonators may be considered part of the waveguide. According to the invention, the spectrometer chip 200 also comprises an anti- reflection region 270 coupled to the second end 220b of the waveguide 220. The anti-reflection region provides an abrupt and wide interface at the end of the waveguide so that waves propagating at the interface between the second end 220b of the waveguide and the anti-reflection region 270 become unguided and spreads into the anti-reflection region where it diverges and becomes absorbed by the anti- reflection region. The anti-reflection region may be formed on the substrate in the same processing step as the waveguide and resonators. It may be provided in the same material or materials as the waveguide and the waveguide and the anti- reflection region may be integrally formed as a single component. The waveguide and the anti-reflection region can be formed from, for example, semiconductor material. The waveguide and the anti-reflection region can alternatively be formed from different materials. However, that would of course require an additional processing step. Hereinafter, the waveguide and the anti-reflection region will be described as formed from the same material in the same processing step. The anti- reflection region 270 may be provided as an additional feature in the mask layout of the spectrometer chip. The length and the width of the anti-reflection region are optimised to ensure that negligible back reflection of light occurs. Since the back reflection is effectively eliminated, or at least reduced using the anti-reflection region, a low reflective coating at the end of the waveguide is not required and the costly extra step of evaporating or sputtering the coating onto the waveguide can be avoided. It will be appreciated that although the anti-reflection region 270 has been described with respect to a spectrometer 200 above, it can be used to provide a mechanism for reducing or eliminating back reflection in any photonic component. A general waveguide arrangement structure is shown with respect to Figure 3 and 4. With reference to Figure 3, a light guiding section, provided by the waveguide 220, is directly connected to a radiation absorption section provided by the anti-reflection region 270. Both sections may be patterned on top of a substrate 210, as shown in Figure 4. The waveguide 220 and the anti-reflection region may be provided as one or a number of layers provided on top of the substrate as will be described in more detail below. The materials and the depths of the one or more layers are selected to guide the radiation in the waveguide without high losses but also such that the radiation is absorbed and scattered when the radiation becomes unguided and diverges in the anti-reflection region. As discussed above, the width and the length of the anti-reflection region 270 is optimised to minimise back reflection of light reaching the end 220b of the waveguide. It is contemplated that the anti-reflection region 270 may not necessarily form a rectangle but an irregular geometrical shape. The length is then considered the distance in the direction of propagation of the wave and the width is considered the distance in the direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave in the waveguide 220. As shown in Figure 3, the width Wa of the anti-reflection region 270 is selected to be substantially wider than the width Wb of the waveguide 220. The waveguide can, for example, have a width of between 0.5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9 to 5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9. The waveguide may be designed to support a single mode of resonance. Typically, the width of the waveguide Wb is of the order of the wavelength of the radiation in a material from which the waveguide is formed. It may be substantially equal to, or slightly larger than, the width of the wavelength of the radiation in the material from which the waveguide is formed. More importantly, the width Wa of the anti-reflection region 270 is substantially wider than the wavelength of the light or other radiation in the material from which the waveguide and the anti-reflection region are formed. The waveguide and anti- reflection region may be formed from a semiconductor material and the width Wa may be significantly wider than the wavelength \u03bb of the radiation in the semiconductor material. The width of the anti-reflection region should be sufficiently large to ensure that the radiation present in the anti-reflection region is no longer guided. The width Wa of the waveguide may be equal to or wider than three times the wavelength \u03bb of the radiation in the material from which the waveguide and the anti-reflection region is formed to suppress back reflections into the waveguide. The input beam may include a plurality of wavelengths, for example when the device is a spectrometer as shown in Fig. 2. In such cases, the wavelength \u03bb based on which the dimensions of the anti-reflection region are determined may, for example, be the mean wavelength, in the material of the anti-reflection region, of the wavelength range of interest in the input beam. Moreover, the length of the anti-reflection region is longer than the wavelength \u03bb of the radiation in the waveguide and the anti-reflection region. To eliminate effectively all the back reflection, the length of the anti-reflection region should be at least five times larger than the wavelength \u03bb of the radiation in the semiconductor from which the anti-reflection region is formed. The waveguide and the anti-reflection region may be formed from a material having a refractive index substantially higher than air. If, for example, the waveguide comprises a semiconductor material having a refractive index of approximately 3 and the waveguide is arranged to receive radiation of wavelength 1500nm in air, the wavelength in the light guiding section would be approximately 500nm. It has then been found that a minimum length of the anti-reflection region, for significantly reducing back reflection, would be 2.5 \u03bc\u03c0\u03b9. It is contemplated that a length of approximately 3\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9 would provide a suitable length for eliminating back reflection Moreover, the minimum width would be 1.5 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b7. As mentioned before, it is contemplated that as long as the distance of the anti-reflection region in the direction of propagation of light is equal to or longer than 5 times the wavelength \u03bb of the radiation in the material from which the anti-reflection region is formed and the width is equal to or wider than 3 times the wavelength \u03bb of radiation in the material from which the anti-reflection region is formed, the amount of reflected radiation is significantly reduced. Figure 4 shows a cross-section along the line IV-IV of Figure 3. As shown, a number of layers are deposited on top of the substrate 210. Figure 4 only shows a small number of layers and it will be appreciated that the structure can include additional layers. The waveguide may be deposited onto the substrate as one or more layers. The waveguide 220 and the anti-reflection region 270 may extend in the same plane as the waveguide and be integrally formed with the waveguide. The substrate may be manufactured from any suitable type of semiconductor. For example, the substrate may be formed from n-doped Indium Phosphide (InP) with a dopant concentration of about l-3x 1018cirf3. On top of the substrate there may be provided an etch-stop layer (not shown), which prevents etching of the substrate, and on top of the etch-stop layer there may be provided a support layer (not shown). As an example, an etch-stop layer may be formed from n-doped InGaAsP with a dopant concentration of 0.18-1.2x 1018cirf3 and the support layer may be formed from n-doped InP with a dopant concentration of 4-6x1017cirf3. The waveguide 220 and the anti-reflection region 270 are then provided as one or more layers on top of the support layer. The layers may be formed from undoped InGaAsP. On top of the one or more layers forming the waveguide there may be formed a capping layer (not shown). The capping layer may be formed from p- doped InP with a dopant concentration of about 2xl 018cirf3. There may also be provided an isolation layer for metallisation on top of the capping layer. The one or more layers that provide the waveguide 220 and the anti-reflection region 270 may have a higher refractive index than the support layer and the capping layer and the waveguide is formed from the refractive index contrast between the layers forming the waveguide and the support layer and capping layers. It will be appreciated that the layer structure described above is just an example and one or more layers may be removed or replaced. For example, if the structure does not comprise a support layer, the waveguide and anti -reflection region is provided between the refractive index contrast between the waveguide layers and the capping layer and the substrate. The one or more layers forming the waveguide and the anti-reflection region may comprise a layer with a band gap designed to absorb the radiation. It may be designed to have a low absorption coefficient to limit the absorption in the waveguide. When the light enters the anti-reflection region it becomes unguided. This means that the light travels over a greater distance through the absorbing layer and more of it is absorbed. Some of the light scatters, some of it back reflects from the semiconductor/ air interface but then scatters further and undergoes more absorption on the way back. In other words, the key concept is that the light travels a greater distance through lossy material in the anti-reflection region and is strongly absorbed. The one or more layers may form an active layer stack comprising two cladding layers between which an active absorbing layer is sandwiched. The absorbing layer may be a quantum well with a band gap designed to absorb the radiation in the anti- reflection region. The quantum well may be grown by molecular beam epitaxy or chemical vapour deposition which can control the layer thickness down to monolayers. The quantum well would be sufficiently thin to have little or no influence on the optical field in the waveguide. For example, the quantum well may have a thickness of approximately 3nm. The radiation that enters the anti-reflection region 270 is absorbed in the quantum well provided in the anti-reflection region. The waveguide 220 ensures that the optical field is at a maximum over the quantum well which helps to increase absorptions. If the waveguide arrangement of Figures 3 and 4 is provided in the spectrometer of Figure 2, the resonators 230 would also include some or all of the layers described for the waveguide 220 and the anti-reflection region 270. The capping layer, the support layer and the cladding layers may have band gaps that are greater than the highest-energy photon of interest. In contrast, as mentioned above, an active layer sandwiched between the cladding layers may have a band gap that is less than the lowest-energy photon of interest, i.e. lower than the energy of a photon of the longest wavelength that the spectrometer is configured to detect. In this way, the composition of the active absorbing layer can be used in all disk resonators in the spectrometer. As mentioned above, when the absorbing layer is a quantum well, it is sufficiently thin to have little or no influence on the optical field in the waveguide. When light of a particular wavelength enters the resonator from the waveguide, it travels multiple cycles around the resonator and the photons can be absorbed by the material in the quantum well as the band gap is sufficiently low for even the lowest-energy photons to excite electrons from the valence band into the conduction band, generating electron-hole pairs. The resulting current can be measured, and is proportion to the amount of light energy in the disk resonator. However, it will be appreciated that the structure does not have to be uniform across the resonators 230, the waveguide 220 and the anti-reflection region 270. For example, in some embodiments the absorbing layer is not provided in the waveguide 220. To achieve this, the absorbing layer in the waveguide can be selectively etched and replaced by a wider band-gap alloy or the absorbing layer can only be deposited in the disk resonators and/ or the anti-reflection region in the first place. It should of course be realised that the present invention is not limited to the layer structure shown in Figure 3 and described above, and in other embodiments other structures may be used. Figure 5 shows the results of a simulation illustrating the effect of a 2.5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9 long and 3\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9 wide anti-reflection region on radiation with a wavelength of approximately 500nm in the semiconductor material from which waveguide and anti-reflection region are formed. The x-axis indicates the distance in a direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave in the waveguide and the y-axis indicates the distance in the direction of propagation of waves in the waveguide. It is clear from Figure 5 that the radiation diverges as it enters the anti-reflection region. It is further clear from Figure 5 that the light diverges over an area substantially wider than the width of the waveguide. The region at the end of the waveguide provides an end-stop for the radiation and the back-reflection into the waveguide is minimised. Figure 6a shows the results of another simulation of a waveguide arrangement comprising an anti-reflection region as shown in Figure 6b. Light is detected by a detector in a location near the end of the waveguide coupled to an anti-reflection region substantially wider than the waveguide, as shown in Figure 6b. The location where the light is detected is indicated with an arrow. The graph of Figure 6a shows the intensity of detected light against time. It is clear from Figure 6a that a pulse of light is detected as the light received in the waveguide is guided through the waveguide towards the anti-reflection region and that virtually 0% of the light that reaches the end of the waveguide is reflected back into the waveguide. Whilst specific examples of the invention have been described, the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims and not limited to the examples. The invention could therefore be implemented in other ways, as would be appreciated by those skilled in the art. For example, it will be appreciated that the spectrometer, with respect to which embodiments of the invention have been described, may be considered to be, or form part of, a spectrophotometer. Therefore, where the term \"spectrometer\" has been used, the term could have been replaced with the term \"spectrophotometer\". Moreover, although the spectrometer has been described in places to receive and guide light, the spectrometer can be used to guide and detect electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength. Additionally, although the spectrometer has been described to comprise disk resonators, the described waveguide may be used to guide light into any type of resonators. For example, the resonators may be any high Q cavities, such as spherical resonators, microrings etc. It should be realised that although the invention has been described with respect to a spectrometer on a chip, the invention can be implemented in any device that uses a waveguide for guiding photons and in which back reflections are undesirable. For example, the invention could be used in an interferometer, optical switches, lasers, gratings etc. The invention could be used in any photonic component that utilises a waveguide. A photonic component is any component that generates, emits, transmits, modulates, processes, switches, amplifies detects and senses light. The photonic component can, for example, be used in a photonic integrated circuit, an optical sensor or in an optical communication device, including but not limited to an Add-Drop Multiplexer for an optical communication device.",

Ser. No. 527,274 Claims. (Cl. 250-68) The present invention relates to X-ray photography, and more specifically to film-holding cassettes especially useful in X-ray crystallography. A common technique used in making X-ray exposures for various purposes is known as back-reflection Laue photography. One useful application of this technique, for example, is the determination of crystal structures and orientation. The X-ray beam is directed through an openlng, usually at the center of the film and the cassette, to impinge upon the crystal, positioned on the opposite side of the film and cassette from the X-ray tube. At least a portion of the X-rays are reflected by the crystal back upon the film in a pattern indicative of the structure and orientation of the crystal. After exposure in this manner, the film is removed from the cassette and developed in the usual way. It is then necessary to reconstruct the portion of the film which was removed to form the opening so that precision measurements of the pattern may be taken from a reference position, normally the axis of the X-ray beam. In most common techniques of making X-ray exposures of the back-reflection Laue type, the negative to be exposed is first held within a cutting jig while the hole necessary for passage of the X-ray beam is cut through the negative. It is then necessary to remove the negative from the jig and place it in a proper cassette for exposure, While protecting the photosensitive surface from actinic radiation. It is a principal object of the present invention to provide novel film holding means which permit X-ray exposures to be made with the X-ray beam directed through an opening in the negative, wherein the hole may be cut or punched while the negative is held in position for exposure. A further object is to provide apparatus for holding a photosensitive sheet during exposure to X-rays wherein means aree provided for allowing the X-ray beam to pass through an opening in both the sheet and the holding apparatus, and wherein the portion of the sheet which is removed to allow passage of the beam is automatically replaced in its original position after exposure. Another object is to provide novel apparatus for holding during X-ray exposure, and for providing an opening through, 'a photosensitive sheet of a conventional film packet of a type presently in commercial use. A still further object is to provide a novel combination of elements which permit X-ray exposures of the backrefiection Laue type to be made, processed and analyzed with speed, accuracy and simplicity. Other objects of the invention will in part be obvious and will in part appear hereinafter. The invention accordingly comprises the apparatus possessing the construction, combination of elements and arrangement of parts which are exemplified in the following detailed disclosure, and the scope of the application of which will be indicated in the claims. For a fuller understanding of the nature and objects of the invention, reference should be had to the following detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein: FIGURE 1 is a fragmentary, exploded perspective view of certain elements of one embodiment of the apparatus of the invention; ICC FIG. 2 is a side elevational view in cross section through the center of the apparatus of FIGURE 1; FIG. 3 is a side sectional view, as in FIG. 2, showing certain elements in another position; FIG. 4 is an enlarged, fragmentary, sectional view of portions of the apparatus of FIGS. 2 and 3 shown in still another position; FIG. 5 is an enlarged, perspective view of a fragment of the film sheet held within the apparatus; and FIG. 6 is a fragmentary side sectional view of a portion which may be incorporated with the apparatus. In copending US. patent application Ser. No. 397,938, filed Sept. 21, 1964, which is now Patent No. 3,330,953, there is disclosed a cassette for holding a photosensitive film during X-ray exposures of the back-reflection Laue type. The apparatus of the invention disclosed in the said copending application includes previously known elements of photographic apparatus for use with film assemblages of a type presently in commercial use. The previously known apparatus and film assemblages referred to are presently manufactured by Polaroid Corporation, Cambridge, Mass. and designated as the Land 4 x 5 film holder No. 500, and Land film packets types 52, 53, 57, 510, etc. Both the film holder and packets are described in detail in US. Patent No. 2,933,993 of Albert J. Bachelder et 211., issued Apr. 26, 1960. The embodiment of the invention disclosed in the aforementioned pending application provides a modification of and additional elements used with the previously known film holder and packets which permits use thereof in making back-reflection Laue exposures without an opening through the photosensitive sheet or the light barrier used to protect the sheet. While such exposures are satisfactory for many purposes, it is still sometimes desirable to allow the X-ray beam to strike the subject without attenuation by the photosensitive sheet or the light barrier, as is the case with the apparatus of application Ser. No. 397,938 filed Sept. 21, 1964, which is now Patent No. 3,330,953. The disclosed embodiment of the present invention is shown in combination with elements substantially identical to those used in the aforementioned copending application, and provides further means which allow such apparatus to be used in making exposures With out attenuation of the X-ray beam in passing from the X-ray tube to the subject. That is, means are provided according to the present invention for allowing the X-ray beam to pass through an opening in the film and cassette, as is the usual back Laue exposure techniques, and wherein the opening is formed in the negative as it is held in position for exposure. Elements of the present invention common to the apparatus of copending application Ser. No. 397,938 filed Sept. 21, 1964, which is now Patent No. 3,330,953, are shown in the side sectional views of FIGS. 2 and 3. Such elements include the basic film holding device designated generally by the reference numeral 10, and including front section 12 and rear section 14 which are arranged to form therebetween a light-tight chamber 16 into which may be inserted an appropriate sheet of cut film or film unit. An exposure opening is formed in front section 12, the photosensitive surface of a film unit positioned for exposure within chamber 16 being arranged in registration with the opening for expo-sure therethrough. Flexible light barrier 18 is arranged in covering relation to the opening in front section 12 so that visible light cannot strike the photosensitive surface of the film within holder 19. In a preferred embodiment, light barrier 18 is in the form of an inflated bag having opposing walls 20 and 22. The bag is sealed at its peripheral edges and secured to movable frame 24, having a Wall member of substantially the same configuration as the exposure opening in front section 12 and movable through this opening toward and away from the film unit disposed within chamber 16. Walls 20 and 22 may be constructed from any of a wide number of suitable materials to provide an essentially air-tight bag which is opaque to visible light while permitting passage of X-rays with minimal attenuation. Springs 26 are arranged between movable frame 24 and stationary light shield 28, which extends around movable frame 24, whereby the springs exert a biasing force urging frame 24 toward movement of the wall portion thereof through the opening in front section 12 and into engagement with the film unit. U-shaped slide member 30 is arranged within light shield 28 and is reciprocally movable by means of manually engageable handle 32. Slide 30 includes appropriate cam surfaces for engaging portions of movable frame 24 as the slide member is moved to produce the aforementioned movement of frame 24 under the bias of springs 26. Frame 34 is afiixed to front section 12 around the exposure opening therein, by means of rivets, for example, providing the surface upon which slide 30 moves and also cooperating with light shield 28 to prevent entry of light into chamber 16. The elements described in the preceding paragraph are all shown and described in greater detail in copending application Ser. No. 397,938 filed Sept. 21, 1964, which is now Patent No. 3,330,953, both as to structure and function. With handle 32 moved to its closest position to holder 10, as in FIG. 2, slide 30 is positioned to maintain movable frame 24 away from rear section 14 against the bias of springs 26, thereby permitting a film unit to be freely inserted in chamber 16. When a film unit has been so inserted, movement of handle 32 away from holder moves slide 30 to allow springs 26 to urge frame 24 toward engagement with the film unit. As frame 24 is so moved, light barrier 18 contacts the surface of the photosensitive sheet and the air pressure within the bag formed by walls 20 and 22, the latter being constrained by fixed engagement around their peripheries to frame 24, urges the photosensitive sheet into close engagement with intensifying screen 36, which is arranged within an appropriate recess in rear section 14. The elements described in the following paragraphs are associated with the previously described elements of the prior art to result in the structure providing the objects and advantages of the present invention. Turning now to a more detailed consideration of FIG- URE 1, a fragment of film holder 10, having the previously described elements associated therewith, is shown in phantom lines. Support plates 40 and 42 are fixedly attached to holder 10, by means of screws of rivets 38, for example, on the rear side thereof, i.e., the side which faces the X-ray tube. Plate 40 includes opening 44 through which is inserted one end of cylindrical element 46. As best seen in FIGS. 2 and 3, element 46 also extends through like openings in rear section 14 of holder 10 and bushing 48 which is positioned between the holder and the support plate. Hollow cutter element 50 includes leading portion 52, having cutting edge 54, and trailing portion 56, of larger diameter than portion 52 and having fixed pin 58 extending outwardly therefrom. Cutter element 50 is slidably inserted in hollow cylinder 60 with pin 58 extending through slot 62. Screw 64 includes threaded portions 66, 68 and 70 and radially extending splines 72. The threads of portion 70 are engaged with internal threads within cylinder 60; the threads of portion 68 are engaged with internal threads in trailing portion 56 of cutter element 50; the outside diameter of the threads on portion 66 is smaller than the inside diameter of leading portion 52 of cutter element 50, whereby portion 66 may pass freely through the cutter element. The splined end of screw 64 is covered by end cap 76 which fits over and is secured to the end of cylinder 60. Gear 78 is rotatably mounted on pin 80, which extends from plate 42, and is secured by snap ring 82. Manually engageable handle 84 is secured to gear 78 by rivet 86. Radially extending teeth 88 of gear 78 extend through opening 90 in hollow cylinder 60 to engage splines 72 on screw 64. Thus, rotation of gear 78 by means of handle 84 will rotate screw 64 and move the latter axially with respect to hollow cylinder 60, which is held stationary by engagement therewith of set screw 92, extending through opening 94 in cylindrical element 46. Cutter element 50 is also moved axially through engagement of threaded portion 68 of the rotating screw with the internal threads in the cutter element, the latter being restrained against rotation by engagement of pin 58 in slot 62. The pitch of the threads on portions 68 and 70, and that of the corresponding internal threads in elements 50 and 60, is so constructed that the screw moves axially at a faster rate than the cutter element. That is, the threads on portion 70 have a greater pitch than those on portion 68, screw 54 being advanced at a rate dependent on the former and cutter element 50 at a rate dependent on the latter, whereby the screw moves axially relative to the cutter element as well as to cylinder 60. As shown in FIGS. 24, element 96 extends through a centrally disposed opening 97 in light barrier 18, the bag formed by walls 20 and 22 being sealed around the opening. Conical element 98 is adjustably secured to element 96; spring 100 is arranged between a shoulder on conical element 98 and rigid sheet 102 to exert a biasing force urging elements 96 and 98 away from the rear side of holder 10. Sheet 102 is provided for the purpose of acting as a stationary support for spring 100 and accordingly comprises a substantially rigid sheet of suitable material, such as an opaque plastic, supported by light shield 28 and having a light sealed opening for movement therethrough of element 96. The threads on portion 66 of screw 64 are adapted to engage internal threads 104 Within element 96. Since screw 64 and element 96 are initially positioned on opposite sides of the negative sheet, it is necessary for end portion 66 to extend out of cutter element 50 and through the sheet in order to engage the threads within element 96. This is made possible by the fact that threads 68 and 70 are of dilferent pitch and that the cutter element is so arranged with respect to screw 64 that an opening is cut in the negative before the end of the screw is advanced outside the cutter element. The above-described arrangement of elements and sequence of operations in preparing a sheet of film for exposure are illustrated in the sectional views of FIGS. 2 through 4. The elements are shown in FIG. 2 in their initial positions after insertion of a negative sheet, indicated by the reference numeral 106, into the lighttight chamber through an appropriate insertion and withdrawal portion, an example of which is described hereinafter. The movable light barrier is positioned away from the intensifying screen to allow the negative to be freely inserted into the holder with the photosensitive surface of the negative facing the screen. Also, screw 64 and cutter element 50 are positioned entirely to one side of chamber 16 so that they will not interfere with insertion of the negative. After insertion of the negative, handle 32 is moved by the operator from the position shown in FIG. 2 to that shown in FIG. 3. This serves to move slide element 30 toward the right as seen in these figures, thereby moving the portion of this element which initially supports frame 24 against the bias of springs 26. Frame 24 is moved to the lower position, shown in FIG. 3, under the bias of springs 26, upon movement of handle 32 to the FIG. 3 position. Light barrier 18 is moved along with frame 24 so that wall 22 of the air-filled bag presses against the surface of negative 106; the positive air pressure within the bag thus serves to urge the negative into close contact with the surface of intensifying screen 36. With frame 24 and light barrier 18 in the position shown in FIG. 3, the operator pushes on conical element 98, thereby moving element 96 toward contact with the negative through opening 97 in light barrier 18. Spring 100 is thereby compressed between rigid, transparent 6 sheet 102 and the shoulder on conical element 98. With elements 96 and 8 held firmly in the depressed position of FIG. 3, handle 84 is moved to rotate gear 78, thereby advancing screw 64 and cutter element 50 as previously explained. Edge 54 of cutter element 50 pierces the negative as the elements are advanced and cuts a partially circular opening therein. Edge 54 is so designed and moved that no portion of the negative is completely severed when the cut is made, but rather a movable fiap is formed. This is illustrated more clearly in the enlarged fragment of FIG. 5 which shows a portion of negative 106 with opening 108 formed by cutting and moving flap 110 to the illustrated position. Flap 110 remains attached at portion 112 to the negative. The elements are shown in FIG. 3 just after the negative has been cut by advancement of cutter element 59. It will be noted that end portion 66 of screw 64 has been advanced with respect to cutter element 59 from the retracted position of FIG. 2 to a position approximately even with edge 54 of cutter element 50. Further movement of handle 84 will cause continued advancement of both cutter element 50 and screw 64, the latter at a greater rate than the former, as previously explained. The elements are ultimately moved to the position shown in the enlarged view of FIG. 4, wherein cutter element 50 protrudes a greater distance through opening 1118 in the negative and end portion 66 has been advanced to extend a considerable distance outside the cutter element. The external threads on end portion 66 of screw 64 are designed to engage internal threads 104 in element )6 during the terminal portion of the advancement of screw 64. Thus, elements 96 and 98 will be retained in the position shown in FIG. 4, against the bias of spring 160, by engagement of end portion 66 of screw 64 with element 96. With the elements in the positions just described, the negative is ready for exposure. The X-ray tube is positioned to direct a beam along the axis indicated in FIG. 4 by the line A-A. The crystal, or other such target for the X-ray beam, is positioned along this axis forwardly of the apparatus. It will be noted that axially aligned openings are provided in each of the appropriate elements so that a path is provided along line A-A for the passage of the X-ray beam. Light seal means are pro vided to prevent the entry of visible light, which may cause undesirable fogging of the negative, through the openings provided for the passage of the X-ray beam at both the front and rear of the apparatus. Such means may conveniently comprise a thin layer of black polyethylene, opaque to visible light but substantially transparent to X-rays, positioned at any convenient location in covering relation to the openings. Such means are illustrated in FIGS. 2 through 4 and indicated by the reference numerals 114 and 116. Exposure is then effected by passing the X-ray beam along line AA to strike the target, e.g., a crystal structure, the beam then being reflected back through light barrier 18 and negative 106 to impinge upon intensifying screen 36 in a pattern indicative of the structure and orientation of the crystal. The intensifying screen is stimulated by the X-rays in the usual manner to produce visible light which exposes the negative in the areas of contact thereof with light-emitting areas of the intensifying screen. After exposure in the above-described manner, handle 84 is counterrotated back to the position of FIG. 2. As end portion 66 of screw 64 is retracted the external threads thereon are disengaged from element 96, thereby allowing spring 100 to move elements 96 and 98 back to the position of FIG. 2. Screw 64 and cutter element 50 continue to be retracted, moving from the position of FIG. 4, back through the position shown in FIG. 3, to their initial positions of FIG. 2. Handle 32 is moved from right to left so that it is also returned to its position of FIG. 2, thereby moving the raised portions of slide element 30 back into engagement with frame 24. This serves to move frame 24 against the bias of springs 26 and to lift light barrier 18 out of engagement with negative 106, which may then be removed from the light-tight chamber for processing. Although the apparatus is suited to employ single sheets of a conventional negative which may be inserted into and withdrawn from the light-tight chamber in a darkroom, it is also well suited for incorporation with apparatus employing film units of the self-developing type, such as those mentioned earlier in the present description. These films units include a single sheet of negative, a cooperable image receiving sheet and a container carrying a viscous liquid processing agent for distribution between the sheets, to form a transfer image in a 4 x 5 inch format. The two sheets are initially contained within an opaque envelope which is inserted into the film holding apparatus. The envelope and receiving sheet may then be partially withdrawn from the apparatus leaving the image area of the negative positioned for exposure within the apparatus. After exposure of the negative the envelope and receiving sheet are again fully inserted into the apparatus and the entire film unit is then withdrawn between a pair of pressure-applying members which serve to rupture the container and distribute the contents thereof between the sheets. After the required period for development and formation of the transfer image, the sheets are withdrawn from the envelope and separated, with a developed negative image on the surface of one sheet and a positive image on the other. In FIGS. 2 and 3 are shown fragments of an opaque envelope 113 and image receiving sheet 126 which have been partially withdrawn from light-tigl1t chamber 16 of the holding apparatus of the invention. The envelope, negative and receiving sheet comprise a portion of a typical film assembly of the aforementioned type. Such film units and the apparatus wherein they are employed in clude elements not shown in the present drawings, such as a removable light cap for the open end of the envelope and means for retaining the negative sheet within the light-tight chamber when the envelope and receiving sheet are partially withdrawn. Such elements are not shown in detail since they form no part of the present invention and are well known in the art. The fragmentary, sectional view shown in FIG. 5 illustrates the film unit insertion and withdrawal portion of processing apparatus for such self-developing film units. Such a portion may conveniently be provided at the left hand end of the apparatus of the present invention as pictured in FIGS. 2. and 3. The insertion and withdrawal portion includes a pair of juxtaposed pressure-applying members in the form of rolls 122 and 124. Suitable means (not shown) are provided for moving one of the rolls laterally with respect to the other to provide a space for the insertion of the film unit and the partial withdrawal and reinsertion of the envelope and receiving sheet. The rolls are returned to close proximity for final withdrawal of the film unit so that a compressive force will be applied, thereby rupturing the container and spreading the liquid content thereof between the sheets. Roll 126 is made of a resilient material such as sponge rubber and has flexible splines extending radially therefrom for the purpose of insuring a light-tight insertion and withdrawal portion. Since flap 110 remains attached to the negative sheet in portion 112, which is disposed toward the direction from which the envelope is reinserted, the flap will be pushed back into covering relation to opening 1tll8 by reinsertion of the envelope. Thus, the developer will not tend to leak out from between the sheets since the flap has been replaced, and the negative is essentially a continuous sheet once again. This is also enhanced by the fact that the developer is spread from portion 112, at which the flap is attached to the sheet, toward the free end of the fiap. Also, when the invention is used with conventional cut film, flap 110 will tend to be replaced by having portion 112 disposed toward the withdrawal portion of the holder. From the foregoing explanation it may be seen that the apparatus of the present invention facilitates the making of back-reflection X-ray exposures in applications such as crystallography. Great economy in time of preparation of the photosensitive material for exposure is made possible by performing the cutting operation while the sheet is held in proper position for exposure. The fact that a replaceable flap is cut in the negative, rather than completely removing a portion thereof, is also helpful. The apparatus is equally suitable for employing film units of the self-developing type of conventional cut sheets of negative material. Furthermore, the apparatus is relatively uncomplicated and expedient in operation. Since certain changes may be made in the above apparatus without departing from the scope of the invention herein involved, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.

        "Description": "Description CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a Divisional under 35 U.S.C. 120 of copending U.S. application Ser. No. 10/802,734, filed Mar. 18, 2004, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,817,702, which claims the benefit, under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/455,562, filed Mar. 19, 2003, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates, in general, to a method and apparatus for providing unidirectional emission from an etched laser cavity and for providing low back-reflection from photonic devices, and in particular to photonic devices coupled to the laser output. More particularly, the invention relates to V-shaped lasers and triangular ring lasers with etched gaps to control the unidirectionality of emissions at the outputs of the lasers by providing high side-mode suppression and to the use of an etched facet at or near a Brewster angle to minimize back-reflection in a photonic device. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Advances in current monolithic integration technology have allowed lasers of a variety of geometries to be fabricated, including V-shaped lasers and triangular ring lasers, as described, for example, in Applied Physics Letters, 59, pp. 1395-97, 16 Sep. 1991. These developments expand the prospective applications for integrated semiconductor lasers and add the attractiveness of greater manufacturability and reduced cost. This technology has opened the opportunity to explore new and novel features that can be combined inside and outside the laser cavity. Copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/226,076, filed Aug. 23, 2002, entitled \u0093Wavelength Selectable Device\u0094 and assigned to the assignee hereof, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, discloses monolithic structures that prevent back-reflection from the entrance facet of an element such as an electroabsorption modulator (EAM) into a laser cavity serving as a light source for the element by appropriate selection of the geometry of the device. Unidirectional emitting lasers would be desirable in such configurations to maximize the coupling of laser light into an EAM or other such elements. As is known, a ring cavity laser possess benefits that a Fabry-Perot cavity does not have; for example, a ring cavity will produce lasing action with higher spectral purity than can be obtained with a Fabry-Perot cavity. Monolithic triangular ring lasers as well as other types of ring lasers and their integrated couplings have been described in the prior art, as well as in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/918,544 filed Aug. 1, 2001, entitled \u0093Curved Waveguide Ring Lasers,\u0094 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,680,961, issued Jan. 20, 2004 and assigned to the assignee hereof, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In addition, unidirectional behavior in ring lasers also has been described in the prior art. Over the past few years, thanks mainly to the popularity of the Internet, the demand for bandwidth has experienced explosive growth. Carrier companies and their suppliers have addressed this demand by installing Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) systems which allow multiple wavelengths of laser light to be transmitted through a single strand of optical fiber. One of the main requirements of lasers used in WDM systems is that the laser sources have spectral purity, with the result that most of the power of the laser must be concentrated in a narrow wavelength range. A laser source has a large number of possible longitudinal modes, and although it has the tendency to operate in the one longitudinal mode that leads to the maximum gain, some other modes are also partially amplified, causing it to generate optical radiation in different wavelengths and reducing its spectral purity. The use of a gap for improvement of the spectral characteristics of a Fabry-Perot laser that operates with standing waves was proposed by Larry A. Coldren and T. L. Koch, \u0093Analysis and Design of Coupled-Cavity Lasers\u0097Part 1: Threshold Gain Analysis and Design Guidelines,\u0094 IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, Vol. QE-20, No. 6, pp. 659-670, June 1984. As described, a gap was introduced between two cleaved facets to achieve coupling between different cavities, resulting in an improved mode discrimination depending on the lengths of the cavities and the gap. However, due to the inherent difficulty in building accurately positioned cleaved facets and the tolerances involved in placing two cleaved cavities in close proximity to each other to form a gap, large-scale manufacture of these lasers did not materialize. Etched mirror and groove coupled devices were demonstrated by Larry A. Coldren, et al., in \u0093Etched Mirror and Groove Coupled GaInAsP/InP Laser Devices for Integrated Optics,\u0094 IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, Vol. QE-18, No. 10, pp. 1679-1688, October 1982. However, these etched facets where not equivalent in reflectivity to cleaved facets and the etched versions of these devices were less efficient than their cleaved counterparts. U.S. Pat. No. 4,851,368 taught a process that allowed etched laser facets to be fabricated that were equivalent in reflectivity to cleaved facets. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a new and novel technique for obtaining unidirectionality in semiconductor photonic devices such as ring lasers and in V-shaped lasers, based on the provision of an etched gap or gaps in such lasers, and more particularly to the position of such a gap or gaps with respect to the output facet in a ring laser or with respect to the length of the legs in a V-shaped laser. In addition, this invention is directed to the formation of semiconductor lasers with at least one etched gap to enhance the side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR); i.e., the difference between the power of the main laser wavelength and the side-lobes, in such lasers. Furthermore, the invention is directed to using a facet formed on photonic devices such as optical amplifiers, electroabsorption modulators, or the like at or near the Brewster angle to prevent back-reflection in such a device. In a preferred form of the invention, unidirectionality in semiconductor lasers is enhanced by forming at least one air gap in the laser cavity, or waveguide, with each gap being defined by spaced apart facets to enhance the side-mode suppression ratio in that cavity. The gaps are provided, for example, by etching through the cavity of a ridge-type ring or V-shaped laser which is integrally fabricated on the surface of a substrate. The gap or gaps may be etched in any leg of the laser cavity, and may be etched at 90\u00b0 to the laser axis or, alternatively, at an angle to the axis. In the latter case, the gaps may be etched in spaced-apart pairs, with the waveguide segment between the gaps being offset to compensate for refraction at the etched facets. In another form of the invention, when the laser output is coupled to a photonic device, back-reflection is minimized by the provision of a facet at the Brewster angle at the distal end of the photonic device. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The foregoing, and additional objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become evident from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, taken with the accompanying drawings, in which: FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of coupled monolithic structures arranged to prevent back-reflection from interfering with laser operation; FIG. 2 is a schematic illustration of a triangular ring laser cavity laser with two deep etched gap regions in accordance with the present invention; FIG. 3 illustrates a measured spectrum of the triangular ring laser of FIG. 2; FIG. 4 is a graphical illustration of the unidirectional behavior of the ring laser of FIG. 2; FIGS. 5( a) to 5(f) illustrate basic configurations for a triangular ring cavity with etched gaps in accordance with the invention; FIGS. 6( a) and 6(b) illustrate double air gaps separated by (a) a flat angle facet air gap and (b) an angled facet air gap; and FIGS. 7( a) and 7(b) illustrate a V-shaped cavity with DBR reflectors (a) without air gaps and (b) with air gaps. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIG. 1 illustrates a photonic device in the form of a monolithic, unidirectional, triangular ring laser cavity 10 having legs 12, 14, and 16, with legs 12 and 16 joining at an exit facet 18. Unidirectionality is obtained in laser 10 by the provision of an external mirror 20, which reflects the clockwise light 22 propagating in the laser and emitted at exit facet 18 back into the laser to reinforce the counterclockwise light 24. A portion of the light 24 is emitted at facet 18 as beam 26, which is coupled into another photonic device 28 such as a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA), an electroabsorption modulator (EAM), or the like. In the illustrated arrangement, the device 28 is a V-shaped EAM which includes first and second legs 30 and 32 joined at respective first ends at an output facet 34, with the second end of leg 30 having an inlet facet 36 positioned to receive emitted beam 26, and the second end of leg 32 terminating at its extreme, or distal, end at a facet 38, which is at the Brewster angle to minimize reflectivity. As described in the aforesaid application Ser. No. 10/226,076, undesirable back reflection from an external device such as the photonic device 28 may be reduced by locating input facet 36 in such a way as to couple beam 26 into leg 30 while ensuring that any light 40 reflected from facet 36 will not be coupled back into laser 10. In this manner, the geometry of the device 28 with respect to laser 10 minimizes back coupling; however, this reduces the amount of light that can be coupled into the device 28. To maximize coupling of light from the laser to the modulator, direct coupling can be utilized, where the input facet of device 28 directly influences the performance of the laser, for example, by increasing reflectivity. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, back-reflection to a laser from a photonic element such as the EAM 28 is minimized by the provision, at the extreme distal end of the device 28, of a facet 38 at or near the Brewster angle. With this configuration, light 42, which is coupled into the device 28, propagates in leg 30 and strikes facet 34 below the critical angle to cause an output beam 44 to be emitted. Light 46, which is the portion of light 42 which is internally reflected at facet 34, propagates in leg 32, strikes facet 38, and is emitted as beam 48 instead of being internally reflected back. In this way, light in device 28 that is not emitted as output beam 44 will not reflect back into laser 10, and this will prevent excess chirp from being produced in the laser. For a complete discussion of modulator facet induced laser chirp, see, for example, \u0093DFB laser with attached external intensity modulator\u0094 by D. Marcuse, IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, Volume 26, Issue 2, Pages 262-269, February 1990. Although the laser described in FIG. 1 is a prior art unidirectional ring laser 10, it will be understood that a photonic device 28 with facet 38 at or near the Brewster angle can be coupled with a variety of other types of lasers. It will also be understood that the entrance facet 36 can be at perpendicular incidence to directly couple device 28 to the laser. Another aspect of the invention is illustrated in FIG. 2, wherein at least one gap is provided in a ring laser cavity 60, and wherein the size of such a gap and the lengths of the laser elements making up the cavity determine the spectral characteristics of the laser by improving its side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) and its unidirectionality. In the illustrated embodiment, the ring laser 60 is triangular, and includes legs 62, 64 and 66 joined at facets 68, 70 and 72. Facets 68 and 70 are fully internally reflecting, while facet 72 is an outlet facet which emits counter-rotating light beams 74 and 76. In the illustrated embodiment, two deep gaps 78 and 80 are etched completely through the leg 62, with each having a gap length LG. The length of the segment of leg 62 between facet 72 and gap 78 is identified as LA; the length of the segment of leg 62 between gap 78 and gap 80 is identified as LT; and the length of the segment of leg 62 between gap 80 and facet 68 is identified as LB1. The lengths of legs 64 and 66 are identified as LB2 and LB3, so the total length LB, or perimeter length, of the optical cavity is: LB=LA+LT+LB1+LB2+LB3+2LG The angle between legs 62 and 66 is selected so that output facet 72 has an angle smaller than the critical angle, and because of the gaps 78 and 80 in leg 62, the counterclockwise (left) output beam 74 is stronger than the clockwise (right) output beam 76. It will be understood that the output beam 74 may be directed to a suitable photonic device such as the EAM 28 of FIG. 1. The size of the gaps 78 and 80 and lengths of the various leg elements forming the ring laser cavity 60 determine the spectral characteristics of the laser. By adding a single gap such as gap 78, the laser cavity 60 is divided into two cavities coupled by an air interface. Using two gaps 78 and 80 separated by an intermediate cavity section LT divides the laser into three cavities: LA, LT, and the combination of LB1, LB2 and LB3, that are coupled successively by the gaps. An example of the spectral efficiency of such a device is illustrated in FIG. 3. In one form of the invention, the triangular laser cavity 60 is a monolithic ridge waveguide structure fabricated on an indium phosphide (InP) substrate 90, with a total length LB of 350 \u03bcm. The cavity is suitably biased, in known manner, to generate light, which will propagate in both the clockwise direction, indicated by arrow 92, and the counterclockwise direction, indicated by arrow 94. The legs 62 and 66 of the ring laser cavity meet at facet 72 at an angle 96 selected to produce an angle of incidence of about 12\u00b0 for light propagating in the cavity. To produce a high side-mode suppression output from the laser cavity, as well as unidirectional behavior, at least one air gap is provided in one leg of the cavity. In the illustrated embodiment, two air gaps are etched through cavity leg 62, each gap being about 3 \u03bcm wide, through, for example, photolithography and etching, with the gaps being separated by a cavity section LT of about 17.5 \u03bcm. These etched gaps produce interference between the cavity sections, which leads to the oscillation of one longitudinal mode in the laser cavity. This produces a side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of about 38 dB, as illustrated by curve 100 in FIG. 3, which is the measured spectrum of the light propagating in the counterclockwise direction to produce the output left beam 74. The etched gaps result in a substantially unidirectional emission of light from the cavity. As illustrated by the graphs 102 of FIG. 4, the left beam 74 light is about five times as intense as the right beam 76 light. The total length LB of the laser cavity can vary widely and preferably is between about 10 \u03bcm and 10,000 \u03bcm. Additionally, the number of gaps can vary, and preferably will be between 1 and 10 gaps positioned anywhere along the length of the ring laser cavity. Each gap preferably is between about 0.001 \u03bcm and about 10 \u03bcm in length and will extend completely through the cavity. FIGS. 5( a) to 5(f) illustrate examples of several possible configurations for ring lasers with etched gaps. In these examples, two gaps are used, although it will be understood that fewer or more gaps can be provided, as discussed above. In FIG. 5( a), a triangular ring laser 120 incorporates two gaps 122 and 124 in a left-hand cavity segment, or leg, 126, in FIG. 5( b) the gaps 122 and 124 are located in a bottom cavity segment, or leg, 128, of laser 120, and in FIG. 5( c) the gaps 122 and 124 are located in a right-hand cavity segment 130 of laser 120. FIGS. 5( c) through 5(f) illustrate laser cavity configurations utilizing an external photonic element such as a Bragg reflector (DBR) located adjacent the laser outlet facet. In FIG. 5( d), laser 120 incorporates gaps 122 and 124 in left-hand segment 126, and includes DBR element 140 aligned with arm 126 for reflecting the clockwise (right) beam 142 emitted by the outlet facet 144 of ring laser 120. In this case, the DBR device is located for reflection into the arm nearest the gaps and results in enhanced unidirectionality. In FIG. 5( e), the DBR device 140 is located for reflection into the arm farthest from the etched gaps, and thus is aligned with arm 130 to reflect the counterclockwise light emitted as beam 146 from facet 144. In this case, the SMSR is enhanced by this structure. FIG. 5( f) illustrates an embodiment wherein the DBR 140 is located for reflection into either arm 126 or arm 130 when the gaps 122 and 124 are located in the central arm 128. This structure is a compromise between increased SMSR and unidirectionality. Other configurations may also be provided, as by incorporating gaps in both the left and right arms, with or without DBR devices. Etched gaps, such as those illustrated at 78 and 80 in FIG. 2 and at 122 and 124 in FIGS. 5( a)-5(f) may be formed during the fabrication of the laser cavity in which they are located, or may be separately fabricated by etching the substrate before formation of the cavity or by etching the cavity after it has been fabricated. Such etching may be carried out using conventional photolithographic techniques for locating the gaps and for selecting their width. As illustrated in FIGS. 6( a) and 6(b), the ends of the gaps are defined by facets which the etching process forms in the laser cavity. Thus, for example, in the embodiment of FIG. 6( a), first and second gaps 150 and 152 are fabricated by etching away portions of a laser cavity or waveguide 154, and forming facets in the waveguide at ends 156 and 158 of gap 150 and at ends 160 and 162 of gap 152. These facets may be flat; i.e., at 90\u00b0 with respect to the axis 164 of the waveguide, in a preferred form of the invention. In the embodiment of FIG. 6( b), angled facets are formed at the gaps, in which case the adjoining waveguide segments are offset to compensate for the refraction of light at the interfaces of the laser cavity and the air gaps. In the illustrated embodiment, two air gaps 170 and 172 are provided in a waveguide 174, the air gaps dividing the waveguide into segments 176, 178 and 180. The ends of air gap 170 are formed by parallel angled facets 182 and 184 in segments 176 and 178, respectively, while the ends of air gap 172 are formed by parallel angled facets 186 and 188 in segments 178 and 180, respectively. The facets 182, 184 are angled in a direction opposite to that of facets 186, 188, and the centerline of waveguide segment 178 between the gaps is displaced from the centerline 190 of waveguide 174 to compensate for the refraction of light as it passes throughout the facets into the air gaps and then back into the waveguide. The displacement distance d is related to the angle of the facets with respect to the centerline and to the length l of the air gaps. The angled facets increase the efficiency of a unidirectional ring laser and improve the intensity of the desired output beam (the left beam in FIG. 2) with respect to the output beam being suppressed (the right beam in FIG. 2) by suppressing reflected waves over the traveling waves propagating in the laser cavity. Although two gaps are illustrated in FIG. 6( b), it will be understood that a different number of gaps can be provided. Further, it will be understood that the displacement of the cavity segments with respect to the centerline of the cavity may be established photolithographically in the laser fabrication process. Another embodiment of the invention is illustrated in FIGS. 7( a) and 7(b), wherein the ring-type laser discussed with respect to FIGS. 1-6 is replaced by a V-shaped laser cavity 200. The laser of FIG. 7( a) incorporates first and second legs 202 and 204 fabricated on a substrate at an angle 206 with respect to each other and intersecting at an outlet facet 208, from which light is emitted. The unidirectionality of the laser is established by the relative lengths of the legs 202 and 204. DBR reflectors 210 and 212 may be provided at the free ends of the legs 202 and 204, respectively, to reduce threshold currents and to provide improved performance. As illustrated in FIG. 7( b), unidirectionality in a V-shaped laser cavity 220 is enhanced by incorporating at least one air gap in one of the intersecting legs 222, 224 making up the cavity. In this embodiment, two spaced air gaps 226 and 228 are located in leg 222, with these gaps increasing the SMSR in the cavity to provide an improved unidirectionality at the output facet 230. As illustrated, this embodiment may also employ DBR reflectors 232 and 234 at the free ends of legs 222 and 224, respectively to improve its performance. The air gap structure of the present invention serves to significantly reduce, or prevent, back-reflection when a ring cavity or a V-shaped cavity laser is coupled to another photonic element, such as the EAM device described with respect to FIG. 1. Back reflection is further reduced by the use of a Brewster angle in the photonic element, as at the far end of the EAM in FIG. 1. Although the present invention has been illustrated in terms of preferred embodiments, it will be understood that variations and modifications may be made without departing from the true spirit and scope thereof as set out in the following claims.",

        "Description": "Description\u00a0\u00a0(OCR text may contain errors) Suppression of Back Reflection in a Waveguide Field of the Invention The invention relates to waveguides. More particularly, but not exclusively, the invention relates to the suppression of back reflections of radiation in a waveguide used in a spectrometer.Background of the Invention Waveguides are used to guide electromagnetic radiation from one component of a device to another or to guide radiation within a component. One example of device which utilises a waveguide is a spectrometer.Spectrometers are used in many applications for measuring properties of light across a range of wavelengths. For example, a spectrometer can be used for compositional analysis, by obtaining absorption or emission spectra for an object of interest. The presence and location of peaks within the spectra can indicate the presence of particular elements or compounds. Spectrometers are commonly used for analysis at optical wavelengths, but can also be used at other wavelengths such as microwave and radio wavelengths.Spectrometers are typically relatively complex and expensive devices that require the alignment of a number of moving parts to be controlled with high precision. For example, a typical spectrometer may focus light onto a diffraction grating to split an incident beam into separate wavelengths, and the diffraction grating may be rotated to a specific angle to direct light of a particular wavelength towards a detector. In recent years chip-based spectrometers have been developed which can be highly miniaturised, have no moving parts, and can be manufactured using well-established lithography techniques. An example of such a spectrometer-on-a-chip is shown in Figure 1.The chip spectrometer 100 comprises a substrate 110, onto which are patterned a waveguide 120 and a plurality of disk resonators 130 coupled to the waveguide. Light enters the waveguide at a first end 120a and is guided towards a second end - 2 -120b. The resonators are arranged such that portions of the light in the waveguide are coupled into the disk resonators 130. Each resonator 130 is arranged to support a resonant mode at a particular wavelength such that only light of that wavelength is coupled into the resonator 130. On top of each disk resonator 130 is an electrode 140 for detecting current that is proportional to the amount of light present in that resonator. The current detected in each resonator therefore indicates the amount of light at that wavelength that was present in the input beam of light. Each electrode 140 is further connected to a signal bond pad 150 for connecting the spectrometer 100 to an external device for measuring the current. A portion of the light is not coupled into any of the resonators and reaches the second end 120b of the waveguide. Back-reflections from the end of the waveguide may give rise to interference within the spectrometer chip which degrades the performance of the spectrometer. A low reflective coating 160 is therefore evaporated or sputtered onto the second end 120b of the waveguide to stop back-reflections from light reaching the end of the waveguide. However, the application of the low reflective coating requires an additional processing step in the manufacture of the spectrometer.The invention aims to improve on the prior art. Summary of the Invention According to the invention, there is provided a structure for guiding electromagnetic radiation, comprising: a substrate; a waveguide provided on the substrate and having a first end for receiving electromagnetic radiation and a second end; and an anti-reflection region provided at the second end of the waveguide on the substrate, the length and the width of the anti-reflection region being optimised to suppress back reflection of radiation that reaches the second end of the waveguide.The back reflection in the waveguide is reduced as a result of the radiation becoming unguided as it enters the anti-reflection region where the diverging radiation field is absorbed by the material forming the anti-reflection region. By optimising the length and the width of the anti-reflection region, an effective reflectivity of almost 0% can be achieved. The waveguide and the anti-reflection region may be formed from the same material. The waveguide and the anti-reflection region may be integrally formed as a single component. They may be provided on the substrate in the same processing step. The waveguide and the anti-reflection region may be provided as part of the same layer. If the waveguide comprises more than one layers, the waveguide and the anti-reflection region may provided as part of the same layers. The layers may include a quantum well.The anti-reflection region may have a width substantially wider than a width of the waveguide. The anti-reflection region may further have a width substantially greater than a wavelength of the radiation in a material from which the anti-reflection region is formed. When the anti-reflection region is formed from the same material as the waveguide, the wavelength is also the wavelength of the radiation in the waveguide. For example, the anti-reflection region may have a width of at least 3 times the wavelength of the radiation in the material from which the waveguide and the anti-reflection region are formed. The structure may be a semiconductor based structure and the anti-reflection region may have a width of at least 3 times the wavelength of the radiation in the semiconductor waveguide. More specifically, the wavelength based on which the dimensions of the anti-reflection region is determined is not the free-space wavelength but the wavelength in the material from which the waveguide and the anti-reflection region is formed.The anti-reflection region may have a length substantially longer than a wavelength of said electromagnetic radiation in a material from which the anti-reflection region is formed. When the anti-reflection region is formed from the same material, the wavelength is also the wavelength of the radiation in the waveguide. The anti-reflection section may have a length of typically at least 5 times the length of the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation. Of course, the longer the anti-reflection region, the greater the proportion of radiation that is not back-reflected. When the waveguide and the anti-reflection region are formed from a semiconductor material, the wavelength of the radiation in the waveguide would be the wavelength of the radiation in the semiconductor material.According to the invention there is provided a photonic component comprising the structure as described above.According to the invention, there is also provided a chip comprising the structure as described above.According to the invention, there is also provided a spectrometer comprising the structure described above. The spectrometer may further comprise a plurality of resonators provided on the substrate and coupled to the waveguide.The plurality of resonators may be disk resonators Brief Description of the Drawings Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to Figures 2 to 6 of the accompanying drawings, in which:Figure 1 is a perspective diagram of a prior art spectrometer;Figure 2 is a perspective diagram of a spectrometer with a waveguide arrangement according to some embodiments of the invention;Figure 3 is a plan view of the waveguide arrangement according to the invention; Figure 4 shows a cross-section of the waveguide arrangement of Figure 3;Figure 5 illustrates a propagating continuous wave pattern in the waveguide arrangement according to the invention;Figure 6a is a graph showing how the radiation intensity at a particular location in the waveguide varies with time; and Figure 6b indicates the location in the waveguide where the intensity of radiation is monitored for the graph of Figure 6a. Detailed Description With reference to Figure 2, a perspective view of a spectrometer 200 with a waveguide arrangement according to some embodiments of the invention is shown. The spectrometer is a spectrometer-on-a-chip comprising a substrate 210, onto which are patterned an elongate waveguide 220 and a plurality of disk resonators 230 coupled to the waveguide. The waveguide can be arranged to receive and guide electromagnetic radiation of a predetermined range of wavelengths, including but not limited to optical, microwave or radio wavelengths, and may be a ridge waveguide. Light is received at a first end 220a of the waveguide and is guided towards a second end 220b, and each resonator 230 is arranged to support a resonant mode at a particular wavelength such that only light of that wavelength is coupled into the resonator 230. On top of each disk resonator 230 is an electrode 240 for detecting current that is proportional to the amount of light present in that resonator. The current detected in each resonator therefore indicates the amount of light at that wavelength that was present in the input beam of light. Each electrode 240 is further connected to a signal bond pad 250 for connecting the spectrometer 200 to an external device for measuring the current. It should be realised that although the resonators are described as separate from the waveguide, the resonators may be considered part of the waveguide.According to the invention, the spectrometer chip 200 also comprises an anti-reflection region 270 coupled to the second end 220b of the waveguide 220. The anti-reflection region provides an abrupt and wide interface at the end of the waveguide so that waves propagating at the interface between the second end 220b of the waveguide and the anti-reflection region 270 become unguided and spreads into the anti-reflection region where it diverges and becomes absorbed by the anti-reflection region. The anti-reflection region may be formed on the substrate in the same processing step as the waveguide and resonators. It may be provided in the same material or materials as the waveguide and the waveguide and the anti-reflection region may be integrally formed as a single component. The waveguide and the anti-reflection region can be formed from, for example, semiconductor material. The waveguide and the anti-reflection region can alternatively be formed from different materials. However, that would of course require an additional processing step. Hereinafter, the waveguide and the anti-reflection region will be described as formed from the same material in the same processing step. The anti-reflection region 270 may be provided as an additional feature in the mask layout of the spectrometer chip. The length and the width of the anti-reflection region are optimised to ensure that negligible back reflection of light occurs. Since the back reflection is effectively eliminated, or at least reduced using the anti-reflection region, a low reflective coating at the end of the waveguide is not required and the costly extra step of evaporating or sputtering the coating onto the waveguide can be avoided.It will be appreciated that although the anti-reflection region 270 has been described with respect to a spectrometer 200 above, it can be used to provide a mechanism for reducing or eliminating back reflection in any photonic component. A general waveguide arrangement structure is shown with respect to Figure 3 and 4. With reference to Figure 3, a light guiding section, provided by the waveguide 220, is directly connected to a radiation absorption section provided by the anti-reflection region 270. Both sections may be patterned on top of a substrate 210, as shown in Figure 4. The waveguide 220 and the anti-reflection region may be provided as one or a number of layers provided on top of the substrate as will be described in more detail below. The materials and the depths of the one or more layers are selected to guide the radiation in the waveguide without high losses but also such that the radiation is absorbed and scattered when the radiation becomes unguided and diverges in the anti-reflection region.As discussed above, the width and the length of the anti-reflection region 270 is optimised to minimise back reflection of light reaching the end 220b of the waveguide. It is contemplated that the anti-reflection region 270 may not necessarily form a rectangle but an irregular geometrical shape. The length is then considered the distance in the direction of propagation of the wave and the width is considered the distance in the direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave in the waveguide 220.As shown in Figure 3, the width Wa of the anti-reflection region 270 is selected to be substantially wider than the width Wb of the waveguide 220. The waveguide can, for example, have a width of between 0.51.tm to 51.tm. The waveguide may be designed to support a single mode of resonance. Typically, the width of the waveguide Wb is of the order of the wavelength of the radiation in a material from which the waveguide is formed. It may be substantially equal to, or slightly larger than, the width of the wavelength of the radiation in the material from which the waveguide is formed.More importantly, the width Wa of the anti-reflection region 270 is substantially wider than the wavelength of the light or other radiation in the material from which the waveguide and the anti-reflection region are formed. The waveguide and anti-reflection region may be formed from a semiconductor material and the width Wa may be significantly wider than the wavelength X, of the radiation in the semiconductor material. The width of the anti-reflection region should be sufficiently large to ensure that the radiation present in the anti-reflection region is no longer guided. The width Wa of the waveguide may be equal to or wider than three times the wavelength X, of the radiation in the material from which the waveguide and the anti-reflection region is formed to suppress back reflections into the waveguide. The input beam may include a plurality of wavelengths, for example when the device is a spectrometer as shown in Fig. 2. In such cases, the wavelength X, based on which the dimensions of the anti-reflection region are determined may, for example, be the mean wavelength, in the material of the anti-reflection region, of the wavelength range of interest in the input beam.Moreover, the length of the anti-reflection region is longer than the wavelength X, of the radiation in the waveguide and the anti-reflection region. To eliminate effectively all the back reflection, the length of the anti-reflection region should be at least five times larger than the wavelength X, of the radiation in the semiconductor from which the anti-reflection region is formed.The waveguide and the anti-reflection region may be formed from a material having a refractive index substantially higher than air. If, for example, the waveguide comprises a semiconductor material having a refractive index of approximately and the waveguide is arranged to receive radiation of wavelength 1500nm in air, the wavelength in the light guiding section would be approximately 500nm. It has then been found that a minimum length of the anti-reflection region, for significantly reducing back reflection, would be 2.5 m. It is contemplated that a length of approximately 31.tm would provide a suitable length for eliminating back reflection Moreover, the minimum width would be 1.5 1.tm. As mentioned before, it is contemplated that as long as the distance of the anti-reflection region in the direction of propagation of light is equal to or longer than 5 times the wavelength X, of the radiation in the material from which the anti-reflection region is formed and the width is equal to or wider than 3 times the wavelength X, of radiation in the material from which the anti-reflection region is formed, the amount of reflected radiation is significantly reduced.Figure 4 shows a cross-section along the line Iv-Iv' of Figure 3. As shown, a number of layers are deposited on top of the substrate 210. Figure 4 only shows a small number of layers and it will be appreciated that the structure can include additional layers. The waveguide may be deposited onto the substrate as one or more layers. The waveguide 220 and the anti-reflection region 270 may extend in the same plane as the waveguide and be integrally formed with the waveguide. The substrate may be manufactured from any suitable type of semiconductor. For example, the substrate may be formed from n-doped Indium Phosphide (InP) with a dopant concentration of about 1-3x 1018cm 3. On top of the substrate there may be provided an etch-stop layer (not shown), which prevents etching of the substrate, and on top of the etch-stop layer there may be provided a support layer (not shown). As an example, an etch-stop layer may be formed from n-doped InGaAsP with a dopant concentration of 0.18-1.2x 1018cm-3 and the support layer may be formed from n-doped InP with a dopant concentration of 4-6x1017cm-3. The waveguide 220 and the anti-reflection region 270 are then provided as one or more layers on top of the support layer. The layers may be formed from undoped InGaAsP. On top of the one or more layers forming the waveguide there may be formed a capping layer (not shown). The capping layer may be formed from p-doped InP with a dopant concentration of about 2x1018cm-3. There may also be provided an isolation layer for metallisation on top of the capping layer.The one or more layers that provide the waveguide 220 and the anti-reflection region 270 may have a higher refractive index than the support layer and the capping layer and the waveguide is formed from the refractive index contrast between the layers forming the waveguide and the support layer and capping layers. It will be appreciated that the layer structure described above is just an example and one or more layers may be removed or replaced. For example, if the structure does not comprise a support layer, the waveguide and anti -reflection region is provided between the refractive index contrast between the waveguide layers and the capping layer and the substrate. The one or more layers forming the waveguide and the anti-reflection region may comprise a layer with a band gap designed to absorb the radiation. It may be designed to have a low absorption coefficient to limit the absorption in the waveguide. When the light enters the anti-reflection region it becomes unguided. This means that the light travels over a greater distance through the absorbing layer and more of it is absorbed. Some of the light scatters, some of it back reflects from the semiconductor/air interface but then scatters further and undergoes more absorption on the way back. In other words, the key concept is that the light travels a greater distance through lossy material in the anti-reflection region and is strongly absorbed.The one or more layers may form an active layer stack comprising two cladding layers between which an active absorbing layer is sandwiched. The absorbing layer may be a quantum well with a band gap designed to absorb the radiation in the anti-reflection region. The quantum well may be grown by molecular beam epitaxy or chemical vapour deposition which can control the layer thickness down to monolayers. The quantum well would be sufficiently thin to have little or no influence on the optical field in the waveguide. For example, the quantum well may have a thickness of approximately 3nm. The radiation that enters the anti-reflection region 270 is absorbed in the quantum well provided in the anti-reflection region. The waveguide 220 ensures that the optical field is at a maximum over the quantum well which helps to increase absorptions.If the waveguide arrangement of Figures 3 and 4 is provided in the spectrometer of Figure 2, the resonators 230 would also include some or all of the layers described for the waveguide 220 and the anti-reflection region 270. The capping layer, the support layer and the cladding layers may have band gaps that are greater than the highest-energy photon of interest. In contrast, as mentioned above, an active layer sandwiched between the cladding layers may have a band gap that is less than the lowest-energy photon of interest, i.e. lower than the energy of a photon of the longest wavelength that the spectrometer is configured to detect. In this way, the composition of the active absorbing layer can be used in all disk resonators in the spectrometer. As mentioned above, when the absorbing layer is a quantum well, it is sufficiently thin to have little or no influence on the optical field in the waveguide. When light of a particular wavelength enters the resonator from the waveguide, it travels multiple cycles around the resonator and the photons can be absorbed by the material in the quantum well as the band gap is sufficiently low for even the lowest-energy photons to excite electrons from the valence band into the conduction band, generating electron-hole pairs. The resulting current can be measured, and is proportion to the amount of light energy in the disk resonator.However, it will be appreciated that the structure does not have to be uniform across the resonators 230, the waveguide 220 and the anti-reflection region 270. For example, in some embodiments the absorbing layer is not provided in the waveguide 220. To achieve this, the absorbing layer in the waveguide can be selectively etched and replaced by a wider band-gap alloy or the absorbing layer can only be deposited in the disk resonators and/or the anti-reflection region in the first place.It should of course be realised that the present invention is not limited to the layer structure shown in Figure 3 and described above, and in other embodiments other structures may be used.Figure 5 shows the results of a simulation illustrating the effect of a 2.51.tm long and 31.tm wide anti-reflection region on radiation with a wavelength of approximately 500nm in the semiconductor material from which waveguide and anti-reflection region are formed. The x-axis indicates the distance in a direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave in the waveguide and the y-axis indicates the distance in the direction of propagation of waves in the waveguide. It is clear from Figure 5 that the radiation diverges as it enters the anti-reflection region. It is further clear from Figure 5 that the light diverges over an area substantially wider than the width of the waveguide. The region at the end of the waveguide provides an end-stop for the radiation and the back-reflection into the waveguide is minimised. Figure 6a shows the results of another simulation of a waveguide arrangement comprising an anti-reflection region as shown in Figure 6b. Light is detected by a detector in a location near the end of the waveguide coupled to an anti-reflection region substantially wider than the waveguide, as shown in Figure 6b. The location where the light is detected is indicated with an arrow. The graph of Figure 6a shows the intensity of detected light against time. It is clear from Figure 6a that a pulse of light is detected as the light received in the waveguide is guided through the waveguide towards the anti-reflection region and that virtually 0% of the light that reaches the end of the waveguide is reflected back into the waveguide.Whilst specific examples of the invention have been described, the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims and not limited to the examples. The invention could therefore be implemented in other ways, as would be appreciated by those skilled in the art.For example, it will be appreciated that the spectrometer, with respect to which embodiments of the invention have been described, may be considered to be, or form part of, a spectrophotometer. Therefore, where the term \"spectrometer\" has been used, the term could have been replaced with the term \"spectrophotometer\".Moreover, although the spectrometer has been described in places to receive and guide light, the spectrometer can be used to guide and detect electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength. Additionally, although the spectrometer has been described to comprise disk resonators, the described waveguide may be used to guide light into any type of resonators. For example, the resonators may be any high Q cavities, such as spherical resonators, microrings etc.It should be realised that although the invention has been described with respect to a spectrometer on a chip, the invention can be implemented in any device that uses a waveguide for guiding photons and in which back reflections are undesirable. For example, the invention could be used in an interferometer, optical switches, lasers, gratings etc. The invention could be used in any photonic component that utilises a waveguide. A photonic component is any component that generates, emits, transmits, modulates, processes, switches, amplifies detects and senses light. The photonic component can, for example, be used in a photonic integrated circuit, an optical sensor or in an optical communication device, including but not limited to an Add-Drop Multiplexer for an optical communication device.",
