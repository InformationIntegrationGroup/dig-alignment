        "text": "Organic batteries free of toxic metal species could lead to a new generation of consumer energy storage devices that are safe and environmentally benign. However, the conventional organic electrodes remain problematic because of their structural instability, slow ion-diffusion dynamics, and poor electrical conductivity. Here, we report on the development of a redox-active, crystalline, mesoporous covalent organic framework (COF) on carbon nanotubes for use as electrodes; the electrode stability is enhanced by the covalent network, the ion transport is facilitated by the open meso-channels, and the electron conductivity is boosted by the carbon nanotube wires. These effects work synergistically for the storage of energy and provide lithium-ion batteries with high efficiency, robust cycle stability, and high rate capability. Our results suggest that redox-active COFs on conducting carbons could serve as a unique platform for energy storage and may facilitate the design of new organic electrodes for high-performance and environmentally benign battery devices.

        "text": "In this paper we report the performances of a lithium-ion sulfur battery characterized by a polymer configuration. The cell, based on a sulfur-carbon cathode, a Li-Sn-C nanostructured anode and a PEO-based, polysulfide-added electrolyte, shows very good electrochemical performances in terms of stability and delivered capacity. The remarkable cell performances are ascribed to the mitigation of the cathode dissolution process due to the buffer action ensured by the polysulfide added to the polymer electrolyte. This electrolyte configuration allows the achievement of a stable capacity ranging from 500 to 1500 mAh gS-1, depending on the cycling rate. The use of a polymer electrolyte and the replacement of the lithium metal with a Li-Sn-C nanostructured alloy are expected to guarantee high safety content, thus suggesting the battery here studied as advanced energy storage system.

        "text": "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide non-invasive information about multiple nuclear species in bulk matter, with wide-ranging applications from basic physics and chemistry to biomedical imaging1. However, the spatial resolution of conventional NMR and MRI is limited2 to several micrometres even at large magnetic fields (>1 T), which is inadequate for many frontier scientific applications such as single-molecule NMR spectroscopy and in vivo MRI of individual biological cells. A promising approach for nanoscale NMR and MRI exploits optical measurements of nitrogen\u2013vacancy (NV) colour centres in diamond, which provide a combination of magnetic field sensitivity and nanoscale spatial resolution unmatched by any existing technology, while operating under ambient conditions in a robust, solid-state system3, 4, 5. Recently, single, shallow NV centres were used to demonstrate NMR of nanoscale ensembles of proton spins, consisting of a statistical polarization equivalent to ∼100\u20131,000 spins in uniform samples covering the surface of a bulk diamond chip6, 7. Here, we realize nanoscale NMR spectroscopy and MRI of multiple nuclear species (1H, 19F, 31P) in non-uniform (spatially structured) samples under ambient conditions and at moderate magnetic fields (∼20 mT) using two complementary sensor modalities. At a glance Figures Figure 1: NV NMR experiment. a, NV centre energy level diagram (see Supplementary Methods for details). b, A confocal microscope interrogates a single shallow NV centre, which detects NMR signals from a few-nanometre region of sample on the diamond surface. c, A wide-field microscope images fluorescence from a shallow, high-density layer of NV centres allowing detection of NMR signals from overlapping nanoscale regions of sample on the diamond surface. Only NV centres of the same orientation (shown in red), aligned along an externally applied static magnetic field, B0, contribute to the ensemble NV NMR signal. d, Larmor precessing nuclear spins in the sample produce an effective a.c. magnetic field (such as the one shown by the green line) that is detected by NV sensors in a frequency-selective manner using an XY8\u2013k pulse sequence.

Top inset: Schematic of PFOS molecular structure. Bottom inset: Measured 1H and 19F NMR resonance frequencies as a function of applied static magnetic field B0. Error bars are smaller than the markers. Linear fits yield gyromagnetic ratios γ matching the literature values within experimental error, with the standard deviation in γ determined from the linear fit.

        "text": "Recent advance in understanding the supercritical state posits the existence of a new line above the critical point separating two physically distinct states of matter: rigid liquid and non-rigid gas-like fluid. The location of this line, the Frenkel line, remains unknown for important real systems. Here, we map the Frenkel line on the phase diagram of supercritical iron using molecular dynamics simulations. On the basis of our data, we propose a general recipe to locate the Frenkel line for any system, the recipe that importantly does not involve system-specific detailed calculations and relies on the knowledge of the melting line only. We further discuss the relationship between the Frenkel line and the metal-insulator transition in supercritical liquid metals. Our results enable predicting the state of supercritical iron in several conditions of interest. In particular, we predict that liquid iron in the Jupiter core is in the \u201crigid liquid\u201d state and is highly conducting. We finally analyse the evolution of iron conductivity in the core of smaller planets such as Earth and Venus as well as exoplanets: as planets cool off, the supercritical core undergoes the transition to the rigid-liquid conducting state at the Frenkel line.

        "text": "The magnetic structure and magnetic transport properties of hydrogen-passivated sawtooth zigzag-edge graphene nanoribbons (STGNRs) are investigated theoretically. It is found that all-sized ground-state STGNRs are ferromagnetic and always feature magnetic semiconductor properties, whose spin splitting energy gap Eg changes periodically with the width of STGNRs. More importantly, for the STGNR based device, the dual spin-filtering effect with the perfect (100%) spin polarization and high-performance dual spin diode effect with a rectification ratio about 1010 can be predicted. Particularly, a highly effective spin-valve device is likely to be realized, which displays a giant magnetoresistace (MR) approaching 1010%, which is three orders magnitude higher than the value predicted based on the zigzag graphene nanoribbons and six orders magnitude higher than previously reported experimental values for the MgO tunnel junction. Our findings suggest that STGNRs might hold a significant promise for developing spintronic devices.

        "text": "Ultracold atoms in optical lattices have great potential to contribute to a better understanding of some of the most important issues in many-body physics, such as high-temperature superconductivity1. The Hubbard model\u2014a simplified representation of fermions moving on a periodic lattice\u2014is thought to describe the essential details of copper oxide superconductivity2. This model describes many of the features shared by the copper oxides, including an interaction-driven Mott insulating state and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. Optical lattices filled with a two-spin-component Fermi gas of ultracold atoms can faithfully realize the Hubbard model with readily tunable parameters, and thus provide a platform for the systematic exploration of its phase diagram3, 4. Realization of strongly correlated phases, however, has been hindered by the need to cool the atoms to temperatures as low as the magnetic exchange energy, and also by the lack of reliable thermometry5. Here we demonstrate spin-sensitive Bragg scattering of light to measure AFM spin correlations in a realization of the three-dimensional Hubbard model at temperatures down to 1.4 times that of the AFM phase transition. This temperature regime is beyond the range of validity of a simple high-temperature series expansion, which brings our experiment close to the limit of the capabilities of current numerical techniques, particularly at metallic densities. We reach these low temperatures using a compensated optical lattice technique6, in which the confinement of each lattice beam is compensated by a blue-detuned laser beam. The temperature of the atoms in the lattice is deduced by comparing the light scattering to determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations7 and numerical linked-cluster expansion8 calculations. Further refinement of the compensated lattice may produce even lower temperatures which, along with light scattering thermometry, would open avenues for producing and characterizing other novel quantum states of matter, such as the pseudogap regime and correlated metallic states of the two-dimensional Hubbard model. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Schematic depiction of Bragg scattering. a, Rendering of the experimental set-up used for Bragg scattering. Light is collected for momentum transfers Q = π and Q = θ. A bias magnetic field, which sets the quantization axis and the interaction strength, points in the z direction. The input Bragg beam lies in the y\u2013z plane, and its wavevector makes an angle of 3° with the positive y axis. b, The two spin states are denoted by red and blue circles. AFM order develops at the Mott plateau, shown here to be located in the centre, where n ≈ 1. AFM correlations are suppressed outside the central region where n kin and kout, respectively, to satisfy the Bragg condition kout − kin = π. The red and blue arrows denote light scattered from one spin state or the other. The two spin states scatter with opposite phase shifts, so that their respective sublattices interfere constructively for Q = π. For a different momentum transfer kout − kin = θ, scattering is relatively insensitive to AFM correlations owing to the lack of constructive interference between the scattered photons, which have random relative phases Δϕ. Figure 2: Time-of-flight measurement of scattered intensity from a sample with AFM correlations. a, Normalized intensity of Bragg-scattered light (Q = π) as a function of time-of-flight τ. The in situ (τ = 0) scattered intensity is denoted IQ0, while the intensity after sufficiently long τ, corresponding to an effectively uncorrelated sample, is denoted IQ∞. b, For Q = θ the in situ sample shows a reduction of scattering, as compared to long τ, due to the presence of double occupancies and to the presence of AFM spin correlations (see text). Each data point and error bar is the mean and standard error of the mean (s.e.m.) of at least 17 measurements of the scattered intensity. The solid grey line is the intensity calculated using the value of the Debye\u2013Waller factor at τ, whereas the dashed grey line uses the average value of the Debye\u2013Waller factor during the 1.7 µs exposure of the Bragg probe (see text and Methods). Figure 3: Numerical calculations. a, Spin structure factor per lattice site sπ as a function of n in a homogeneous lattice for several temperatures (see Methods). sπ is sharply peaked near n = 1 and diverges as T approaches TN. b, Density profiles calculated at T/t0 = 0.6 for different U0/t0, using in each case the value of N that maximizes the experimentally measured Sπ (see text and Extended Data Fig. 2). c, Profiles of the local spin structure factor sπ(r), for the same conditions as in b. The vertical green line in b and c marks the radius at which sπ(r) is maximized for U0/t0 = 11.1 (see text). Figure 4: Spin structure factor. Measured Sπ (filled circles) and Sθ (open circles) at optimized N (see text) for various U0/t0. The values of the s-wave scattering length corresponding to U0/t0 for the experimental points are shown along the top axis. For each point at least 40 in situ and 40 time-of-flight measurements of the scattered intensities are used to obtain the spin structure factor. Error bars are obtained from the s.e.m. of the scattered intensities; the raw data are presented in Extended Data Fig. 5. Numerical calculations of Sπ (open symbols, lines as guide to the eye) and Sθ (open symbols, dashed lines as guide to the eye) are shown for various values of T/t*. The numerical calculations for Sθ are unreliable for T/t* U0/t0 > 15. Sθ decreases slightly for weak interactions, where the fraction of double occupancies increases. Extended Data Fig. 1: Compensated optical lattice. a, Schematic of the compensated optical lattice set-up. Along each axis, the radial confinement of the lattice is compensated with a repulsive compensation beam which is combined with the lattice beam using a dichroic mirror. The compensation beam co-propagates with the lattice beam but is not retroreflected; instead a dichroic mirror before the retro-reflection mirror is used to direct the compensation beam to a beam dump. b, The local value of the lattice depth v (black line; right-hand y axis) is shown as a function of distance from the centre along a body diagonal of the lattice. Owing to the finite extent of the lattice beams, v varies across the density profile of the cloud. The density n, calculated for U0/t0 = 11.1 at T/t0 = 0.60, is shown (blue line; left-hand y axis). c, The inhomogeneity in v results in spatially varying Hubbard parameters t (blue line; left-hand y axis) and U/t (black line; right-hand y axis). Extended Data Fig. 2: Atom number for the data in Fig. 4. Atom number N which maximizes Sπ as a function of U0/t0. We control N by adjusting the depth of the dimple trap. Using a linear calibration between the depth of the dimple trap and the final atom number, we obtain the value of N corresponding to the data in Fig. 4. The error bars correspond to the s.e.m. of the dimple depths used in at least 40 in situ and 40 time-of-flight realizations of the experiment, corresponding to the data in Fig. 4. The line is a third-order polynomial fit, which is used to interpolate the value of N for numerical calculations shown in Fig. 4. Extended Data Fig. 3: Round-trip temperature measurements. Measurement of the round-trip T/TF versus hold time th in a compensated lattice with v0 = 7Er and g0 = 3.7Er. The duration of the loading ramps is not included in th. The scattering length is 326a0, which corresponds to U0/t0 = 12.5. Error bars are the s.e.m. of six independent realizations. The temperature in the dimple trap before loading into the lattice is T/TF = 0.04 ± 0.02. Extended Data Fig. 4: Bragg signal decay with hold time. a, Detected counts (from CCD camera) versus th, measured for momentum transfer Q = π for an in situ sample (Iπ0, green circles) and after decay of the Debye\u2013Waller factor (Iπ∞, blue triangles). For longer hold times, the Bragg-scattered intensity Iπ0 decays to match Iπ∞, reflecting the absence of AFM correlations in a sample at higher T. b, The spin structure factor Sπ corresponding to the scattered intensities shown in a. For these measurements the scattering length is 200a0, corresponding to U0/t0 = 7.7 in a 7Er deep lattice. The compensation is g0 = 4.05Er, different from that used for the data in Fig. 4. The increased compensation requires a larger atom number to realize an n ≈ 1 shell in the cloud. The atom number used here is 2.6 × 105 atoms. The duration of the Bragg probe is 2.7 µs for these data. Error bars in a are the s.e.m. of at least 5 measurements for Iπ∞ and at least 10 measurements for Iπ0. Error bars in b are obtained from the s.e.m. of the measured intensities and equation (2). Extended Data Fig. 5: Detected counts for measurement of spin structure factor in Fig. 4. a, Detected counts versus U0/t0, measured for momentum transfer Q = π for an in situ sample (Iπ0, green circles), and after decay of the Debye\u2013Waller factor (Iπ∞, blue triangles). As U0/t0 increases we use a larger atom number to optimize the Bragg signal. Iπ∞ and Iπ0 both increase with U0/t0 owing to the larger N, but Iπ0 shows an additional enhancement due to the presence of AFM correlations. b, Detected counts versus U0/t0, measured for momentum transfer Q = θ for an in situ sample (Iθ0, green circles), and after decay of the Debye\u2013Waller factor (Iθ∞, blue triangles). For Q= θ most of the dependence for both the in situ and time-of-flight intensities is due to the changing N. Error bars in both a and b are the s.e.m. of at least 40 measurements. The overall count rate is higher for Q = θ owing to the different collection efficiency and gain settings of the CCD camera. Extended Data Fig. 6: Entropy per particle at constant T. Overall entropy per particle S/(NkB) as a function of U0/t0 for the calculations at various T/t* shown in Fig. 4 (lines are guides to the eye). For the lowest temperatures, S/(NkB) does not vary significantly over the range of U0/t0 covered by the experiment, justifying the treatment at constant T. A value of S/(NkB) ≈ 0.76 is obtained for the temperature determined from the data in Fig. 4.

        "text": "We propose a method to construct universal order parameters for quantum phase transitions in many-body lattice systems. The method exploits the H-orthogonality of a few near-degenerate lowest states of the Hamiltonian describing a given finite-size system, which makes it possible to perform finite-size scaling and take full advantage of currently available numerical algorithms. An explicit connection is established between the fidelity per site between two H-orthogonal states and the energy gap between the ground state and low-lying excited states in the finite-size system. The physical information encoded in this gap arising from finite-size fluctuations clarifies the origin of the universal order parameter. We demonstrate the procedure for the one-dimensional quantum formulation of the q-state Potts model, for q = 2, 3, 4 and 5, as prototypical examples, using finite-size data obtained from the density matrix renormalization group algorithm.

        "text": "MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs expressed in different tissue and cell types that suppress the expression of target genes. As such, microRNAs are critical cogs in numerous biological processes1, 2, and dysregulated microRNA expression is correlated with many human diseases. Certain microRNAs, called oncomiRs, play a causal role in the onset and maintenance of cancer when overexpressed. Tumours that depend on these microRNAs are said to display oncomiR addiction3, 4, 5. Some of the most effective anticancer therapies target oncogenes such as EGFR and HER2; similarly, inhibition of oncomiRs using antisense oligomers (that is, antimiRs) is an evolving therapeutic strategy6, 7. However, the in vivo efficacy of current antimiR technologies is hindered by physiological and cellular barriers to delivery into targeted cells8. Here we introduce a novel antimiR delivery platform that targets the acidic tumour microenvironment, evades systemic clearance by the liver, and facilitates cell entry via a non-endocytic pathway. We find that the attachment of peptide nucleic acid antimiRs to a peptide with a low pH-induced transmembrane structure (pHLIP) produces a novel construct that could target the tumour microenvironment, transport antimiRs across plasma membranes under acidic conditions such as those found in solid tumours (pH approximately 6), and effectively inhibit the miR-155 oncomiR in a mouse model of lymphoma. This study introduces a new model for using antimiRs as anti-cancer drugs, which can have broad impacts on the field of targeted drug delivery.

        "text": "Constructing safe and effective gene delivery carriers is becoming highly desirable for gene therapy. Herein, a series of supramolecular crosslinking system were prepared through host-guest binding of adamantyl-modified low molecular weight of polyethyleneimine with L-cystine-bridged bis(β-cyclodextrin)s and characterized by 1H NMR titration, electron microscopy, zeta potential, dynamic light-scattering, gel electrophoresis, flow cytometry and confocal fluorescence microscopy. The results showed that these nanometersized supramolecular crosslinking systems exhibited higher DNA transfection efficiencies and lower cytotoxicity than the commercial DNA carrier gold standard (25 kDa bPEI) for both normal cells and cancer cells, giving a very high DNA transfection efficiency up to 54% for 293T cells. Significantly, this type of supramolecular crosslinking system possesses a number of enzyme-responsive disulfide bonds, which can be cleaved by reductive enzyme to promote the DNA release but recovered by oxidative enzyme to make the carrier renewable. These results demonstrate that these supramolecular crosslinking systems can be used as promising gene carriers.

In spite of their tremendous potential, adoption of the MLA has been hampered by a number of issues, particularly wavelength precision and fabrication cost. In this paper, we report high channel count MLAs in which the wavelengths of each channel can be determined precisely through low-cost standard μm-level photolithography/holographic lithography and the reconstruction-equivalent-chirp (REC) technique. 60-wavelength MLAs with good wavelength spacing uniformity have been demonstrated experimentally, in which nearly 83% lasers are within a wavelength deviation of ±0.20 nm, corresponding to a tolerance of ±0.032 nm in the period pitch. As a result of employing the equivalent phase shift technique, the single longitudinal mode (SLM) yield is nearly 100%, while the theoretical yield of standard DFB lasers is only around 33.3%.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information Magneto-chiral dichroism is a non-reciprocal\u2014that is, directional\u2014effect observed in magnetized chiral systems, featuring an unbalanced absorption of unpolarized light depending on the direction of the magnetization. Despite the fundamental interest in a phenomenon breaking both parity and time-reversal symmetries, magneto-chiral dichroism is one of the least investigated aspects of light\u2013matter interaction most likely because of the weakness of the effect in most reported experiments. Here we have exploited the element selectivity of hard X-ray radiation to investigate the magneto-chiral properties of enantiopure crystals of two isostructural molecular helicoidal chains comprising either cobalt(II) or manganese(II) ions. A strong magneto-chiral dichroism, with Kuhn asymmetry of the order of a few per cent, has been observed in the cobalt chains system, whereas it is practically absent for the manganese derivative. The spectral features of the X-ray magneto-chiral dichroism signal differ significantly from the natural and magnetic dichroic contributions and have been rationalized here using the multipolar expansion of matter\u2013radiation interaction. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Structures of the molecular magnetic helices and experimental set-up. a,b, View of the simplified structure of the [M-NIT]∞ molecular helices containing CoII (a) and MnII (b) ions bridged by organic nitronyl-nitroxide radicals, with a radical unit highlighted by the red circle. The metal ions are highlighted as large spheres. The ancillary hfac ligands and the radical backbone are in grey, while the bonds constituting the pathway for the magnetic exchange interaction are highlighted in yellow, with the radical oxygen atoms in red and nitrogen atoms in blue. Some groups of atoms (that is, CF3, CH3, and O\u2013CH3) have been omitted for the sake of clarity. The helices develop along the crystallographic c axis of the P31/P32 space groups. The green arrows represent the orientation of the magnetic moments when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the c axis, which are not collinear to the field in the case of the anisotropic CoII ions. c, Schematic side view of the geometry of the experiment, where needle-like single crystals were mounted on a copper sample holder to form an angle of 15° between the chain direction, c, and the propagation vector, k, of the X-rays, which is parallel to the applied magnetic field. d, Photograph of the sample mounting, viewed from the top, with a ruler as reference. Figure 2: X-ray absorption and dichroic spectra of the [Co-NIT]∞ helix. Normalized XANES spectra at the K-edge of Co measured at B = 3 T and T = 5 K. The dichroic contributions estimated according to equations (1)\u2013(3), and expressed as the percentage of the edge jump in the absorption, are reported for two opposite enantiomers\u2014one in colour and the other in pale grey for clarity. The dashed black lines correspond to the calculated XANES and XNCD for the P31 enantiomer, whose helicity is visible in the schematic structure drawn in the inset, with arrows representing the non-collinear spin structure of the cobalt helix.

Figure 4: Field dependence of magnetic and magneto-chiral dichroism of the [Co-NIT]∞ helix. XMχD (red spheres) and XMCD (blue spheres) signals in arbitrary units measured at the photon energy of their maximum intensity (see inset) are reported as a function of the magnetic field applied at 15° from the c crystallographic axis at T = 8 K. In the inset, the photon energy dependence of the intensity of the dichroic contributions (XNCD in green, XMCD in blue, XMχD in red) are reported as the asymmetric ratio g = Δμ/μ; that is, normalizing the signal to the absorption intensity at the same photon energy, which is assumed to be zero before the K-edge. The red and blue arrows indicate the photon energy used to record the field dependence of the corresponding dichroic signals. a.u., arbitrary units.

Although many studies of ferroelectric switching have been undertaken, much remains to be understood about switching in complex domain structures and in devices. In this work, a combination of thin-film epitaxy, macro- and nanoscale property and switching characterization, and molecular dynamics simulations are used to elucidate the nature of switching in PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 thin films. Differences are demonstrated between (001)-/(101)- and (111)-oriented films, with the latter exhibiting complex, nanotwinned ferroelectric domain structures with high densities of 90° domain walls and considerably broadened switching characteristics. Molecular dynamics simulations predict both 180° (for (001)-/(101)-oriented films) and 90° multi-step switching (for (111)-oriented films) and these processes are subsequently observed in stroboscopic piezoresponse force microscopy. These results have implications for our understanding of ferroelectric switching and offer opportunities to change domain reversal speed.

        "text": "Scanning probe microscopy is one of the most versatile windows into the nanoworld, providing imaging access to a variety of electronic1, dielectric2, magnetic3 and topographic4, 5 sample properties, depending on the probe used. Here, we demonstrate a scanning probe imaging method that extends the range of accessible quantities to label-free imaging of chemical species while operating on arbitrary samples\u2014including insulating materials\u2014under ambient conditions. Moreover, its sensitivity extends below the surface of a sample, allowing for imaging of subsurface features. We achieve these results by recording NMR signals from a sample surface with a recently introduced scanning probe, a single nitrogen\u2013vacancy centre in diamond. We demonstrate NMR imaging with 10 nm resolution and achieve chemically specific contrast by separating fluorine from hydrogen-rich regions. Our result opens the door to scanning probe imaging of the chemical composition and molecular structure of arbitrary samples. A method with these abilities will find widespread application in materials science, even on biological specimens down to the level of single macromolecules. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Experimental configuration. A single NV centre implanted a few nanometres below the diamond surface (red spin; for fabrication details see Methods) detects nuclear spins in a nanoscale detection volume above the diamond surface (red half-sphere). Imaging is performed by scanning a sample of NMR-active nuclear spins through this detection volume. In all experiments, a layer of proton-rich organic adsorbates is present on the diamond surface, as this is unavoidable under ambient conditions. In all measurements a static magnetic field of 21.4 mT was applied along the NV axis.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 Change history\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information From bone and wood to concrete and carbon fibre, composites are ubiquitous natural and synthetic materials. Eshelby\u2019s inclusion theory describes how macroscopic stress fields couple to isolated microscopic inclusions, allowing prediction of a composite\u2019s bulk mechanical properties from a knowledge of its microstructure. It has been extended to describe a wide variety of phenomena from solid fracture to cell adhesion. Here, we show experimentally and theoretically that Eshelby\u2019s theory breaks down for small liquid inclusions in a soft solid. In this limit, an isolated droplet\u2019s deformation is strongly size-dependent, with the smallest droplets mimicking the behaviour of solid inclusions. Furthermore, in opposition to the predictions of conventional composite theory, we find that finite concentrations of small liquid inclusions enhance the stiffness of soft solids. A straightforward extension of Eshelby\u2019s theory, accounting for the surface tension of the solid\u2013liquid interface, explains our experimental observations. The counterintuitive stiffening of solids by fluid inclusions is expected whenever inclusion radii are smaller than an elastocapillary length, given by the ratio of the surface tension to Young\u2019s modulus of the solid matrix. These results suggest that surface tension can be a simple and effective mechanism to cloak the far-field elastic signature of inclusions. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Stretching droplets embedded in soft solids. a, The sample is clamped and stretched in the x-direction. b, Example images of ionic-liquid droplets in a soft, silicone solid E = 1.7 kPa. Larger droplets deform more at the same applied strain. Overlay shows small (blue), medium (red) and large (green) droplet images combined together for shape comparison. Figure 2: Aspect ratio of stretched ionic-liquid droplets in a soft (E = 1.7 kPa) silicone gel as a function of size and strain. a, Aspect ratios of eight droplets of different sizes increase linearly with applied strain. The dashed\u2013dotted line shows the change in aspect ratio of the solid under the applied strain εx∞, εy∞. Large droplets (R ≳ 5 μm) stretch more than the solid. Smaller droplets stretch less. The dotted (continuous) line shows the prediction from Eshelby theory for incompressible liquid (rigid) solid inclusions respectively3. b, Aspect ratio of droplets depends sensitively on size. Different colours correspond to different applied strains. Dashed curves show theoretical predictions using equations (2) and (3) with ϒ = 0.0036 N m−1. Figure 3: Young\u2019s modulus of soft composites as a function of liquid content. Glycerol droplets embedded in E ~ 100 kPa (a) and E ~ 3 kPa (b) silicone gels. Dashed curves show Eshelby\u2019s predictions for incompressible liquid droplets in an incompressible solid with Young\u2019s modulus E. Figure 4: Theoretical predictions of composite behaviour. a, The data from Fig. 2b collapses onto a master curve when plotting the ratio of the microscopic to macroscopic strains (equations (4) and (5)) against the estimated radius (equation (4)). The dashed curve shows the theoretical prediction in equation (5). b, Effective Young\u2019s modulus of a composite consisting of monodisperse droplets embedded in a uniform solid, from equation (7). The blue(black) data points are the composite stiffness data from Fig. 3 scaled by E = 3 kPa (E = 100 kPa) for the soft (stiff) composites respectively. c, Droplets with surface tension can be considered as equivalent elastic inclusions without surface tension. The red curve shows how the stiffness of the equivalent elastic inclusion, Ei, depends on ϒ/ER. For small ϒ/ER, this agrees fairly well with the approximation Ei = 2ϒ/R, shown by the blue line.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 Accession codes\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information Ubiquitination of the αN-terminus of protein substrates has been reported sporadically since the early 1980s. However, the identity of an enzyme responsible for this unique \u200bubiquitin (\u200bUb) modification has only recently been elucidated. We show the Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2) \u200bUbe2w uses a unique mechanism to facilitate the specific ubiquitination of the α-amino group of its substrates that involves recognition of backbone atoms of intrinsically disordered N termini. We present the NMR-based solution ensemble of full-length \u200bUbe2w that reveals a structural architecture unlike that of any other E2 in which its C terminus is partly disordered and flexible to accommodate variable substrate N termini. Flexibility of the substrate is critical for recognition by \u200bUbe2w, and either point mutations in or the removal of the flexible C terminus of \u200bUbe2w inhibits substrate binding and modification. Mechanistic insights reported here provide guiding principles for future efforts to define the N-terminal ubiquitome in cells. At a glance Figures Figure 1: \u200bUbe2w has distinct E2 activity. (a) \u200bUbe2w (2w) transfers a single \u200bUb to \u200bRPB8 in vitro, whereas other \u200bBRCA1-interacting \u200bUb conjugating enzymes \u200bUbcH5c (H5c), \u200bUbcH7 (H7) and \u200bUbe2e1 (e1) do not (Supplementary Fig. 2a). MW, molecular weight. (b) Left, a nucleophile reactivity assay reveals that \u200bUbe2w has intrinsic activity with αNH2 groups of a peptide with a free NH2 group at its N terminus (NH2-A-G-G-S-Y-COO−; 50 mM) but not the ɛNH2 groups of \u200blysine. Buff, buffer; Pep, peptide. Right, identical reactions with \u200bUbcH5c∼\u200bUb conjugates confirm the previously reported \u200blysine reactivity of \u200bUbcH5c and reveal it to be unreactive toward the peptide (Supplementary Fig. 2b). (c) Products generated on \u200bRPB8 depend on the \u200bUb species in the reaction. Lanes 1 and 2: a single \u200bUb is attached to \u200bRPB8 in a reaction with WT \u200bUb. Lane 3: attachment of an additional \u200bUb is detected in a reaction with HA-\u200bUb, which contains a 13-residue tag at the N-terminal end of \u200bUb. Lane 4: the reaction carried out with \u200blysine-free HA-\u200bUb (HA-\u200bUb(K0)) confirms that \u200bUbe2w builds linear \u200bUb chains (i.e., attaches the C terminus of one \u200bUb to the N terminus of another) on \u200bRPB8 with HA-\u200bUb (Supplementary Fig. 2d). (d) Reactions shown in c were blotted for \u200bUb, revealing that \u200bUbe2w builds linear poly-\u200bUb chains only when \u200bUb harbors an N-terminal HA tag (Supplementary Fig. 2e). Figure 2: \u200bUbe2w transfers \u200bUb to flexible/disordered N termini. (a) Negative 1H\u201315N hetNOE values for residues derived from the HA tag are indicative of highly flexible amino acids. Error bars represent s.e.m. Resonances from the HA tag are not assigned and are not plotted sequentially; they are labeled simply as 'HA'. (b) Consistent with the 1H\u201315N hetNOE data, the crystal structure of \u200bUb (PDB code 1UBQ) is ordered at its αN terminus and immediately forms a β-strand with residue Met1. (c) \u200bUb to which two N-terminal amino acids have been added at the N terminus (Met-Gly-\u200bUb (M-G1)) is not incorporated into chains by \u200bUbe2w and displays similar activity to WT \u200bUb. Four N-terminal residues (Met-Gly3-\u200bUb (M-G3)) are sufficient to induce \u200bUbe2w activity toward \u200bUb. Addition of six (Met-Gly5-\u200bUb) or eight (Met-Gly7-\u200bUb) residues increases \u200bUbe2w N-terminal ubiquitination activity (note: bands below 37 kDa are consistent with autoubiquitinated E2 and E3) (Supplementary Fig. 2f). MW, molecular weight. (d) N-terminal backbone amide groups are necessary for \u200bUbe2w-dependent ubiquitination. Lanes 1\u20138: \u200bUbe2w shows increased activity with the addition of disordered N-terminal amino acids. Lanes 9 and 10: \u200bproline (P) at positions 2\u20134 (M-P3G5) inhibits \u200bUbe2w chain-building activity to levels similar to WT \u200bUb (Supplementary Fig. 2g). Figure 3: The \u200bUbe2w C terminus is flexible and occupies a noncanonical position. (a) Residues 7\u2013132 of \u200bUbe2w have generally uniform and positive 1H\u201315N hetNOE values. Beginning at residue 137, values decrease and ultimately become negative at the extreme C terminus, consistent with a region that undergoes motions at higher frequencies than the core of the protein. Error bars represent s.e.m. (b) For comparison, \u200bUbcH5c has positive hetNOE values throughout its entire protein sequence, even at the far C terminus. Error bars represent s.e.m. (c) Left, experimental CSP data based on a comparison of the 1H\u201315N HSQC-TROSY spectra of \u200bUbe2w-KK and \u200bUbe2w-131Δ-KK reveals that removal of the C terminus perturbs residues near the active site, in the 310 helix and on the backside β-sheet (purple). Right, if C-terminal helices were to reside in their canonical positions in \u200bUbe2w, a surface consisting of loops 3 and 5 would be perturbed by removal of residues 132\u2013151. Residues depicted to be perturbed are colored in purple, demonstrating that the C-terminal region of \u200bUbe2w is different from other E2s. Figure 4: NMR ensemble of \u200bUbe2w reveals a new E2 architecture. (a) Solution ensemble of \u200bUbe2w derived from NMR restraints (backbone chemical shifts, CSPs, RDCs, paramagnetic spin-label data and SAXS) calculated with CS-Rosetta. The 20 lowest-energy members of the ensemble are shown and reveal a well-defined core with high structural similarity to canonical E2s. The C-terminal region is partially disordered and occupies multiple positions near the \u200bUbe2w active site C91 (orange). (b) Similar views of a representative canonical UBC domain structure (\u200bUbcH5c; PDB code 2FUH). (c) Helix 4 (the penultimate helix) has distinct positions in \u200bUbe2w (three representatives of the 20-member ensemble are shown for clarity). A flexible loop emanating from helix 3 leads away from the protein core. Helix 4 is clustered in three distinct positions in the ensemble (light gray, cluster 1; gray, cluster 2; dark gray, cluster 3). (d) Side view of the full \u200bUbe2w ensemble looking down the helix 3 axis reveals the three clusters. (e) In all 20 members of the \u200bUbe2w ensemble, residues N136\u2013W145 occupy positions beneath the active site, C91 (orange). Residues 119\u2013135 are not shown for clarity. No clustering is evident for this region, and the Cβ atom of every residue is, on average, 14.5\u201317.5 Å away from the active site. Figure 5: The \u200bUbe2w C terminus is required to interact with substrates. (a) 1H\u201315N HSQC-TROSY spectrum of \u200bUbe2w-KK in the absence (black spectrum) and presence of 1 molar equivalent of \u200bRPB8 (red spectrum). Evidence for binding is seen as peak broadening (loss of intensity) and CSPs of specific peaks in the \u200bUbe2w NMR spectrum. (b) A histogram showing CSPs upon addition of 1 molar equivalent of \u200bRPB8 into \u200bUbe2w-KK. (c) Titration of 1 molar equivalent of \u200btau into \u200bUbe2w-KK reveals very similar CSPs to addition of \u200bRPB8. (d) 1H\u201315N HSQC-TROSY spectrum of \u200bUbe2w-131Δ-KK in the absence (black spectrum) and presence of 1 molar equivalent of \u200bRPB8 (red spectrum). Truncated \u200bUbe2w shows no interaction with \u200bRPB8. (e) Residues whose resonances have considerable intensity losses and/or CSPs (>1 s.d.) are mapped in purple onto members of the \u200bUbe2w ensemble (one representative from each cluster). (f) In an in vitro ubiquitination assay, \u200bUbe2w-131Δ does not transfer \u200bUb to \u200bRPB8 after 1 h. Mutation of a single residue in the C-terminal region, W144E, also abrogates detectable activity. The loss of activity associated with the C-terminal region is equivalent to a mutant in which the active site is dead (C91S) (Supplementary Fig. 2k). MW, molecular weight. Figure 6: The \u200bUbe2w C terminus facilitates α-amino group reactivity. (a) Selected 1H\u201315N resonances of residues near the \u200bUbe2w active site are compared in the spectra of full-length WT (black), \u200bUbe2wW144E (blue) and \u200bUbe2w-131Δ (red). Resonances move along similar trajectories as a result of the W144 mutation or C-terminal ablation, indicating similar chemical environments for the affected residues. (b) Mutation or ablation of the C terminus affects the intrinsic aminolysis activity of \u200bUbe2w. In a 1-h reaction, WT \u200bUbe2w∼\u200bUb shows robust transfer activity toward peptide (NH2-A-G-G-S-Y-COO−; 30 mM), as seen by increased amounts of free \u200bUbe2w and free \u200bUb. \u200bUbe2wW144E∼\u200bUb and the \u200bUbe2w-131Δ∼\u200bUb mutants show almost no \u200bUb transfer activity to this minimal substrate over the same time period (Supplementary Fig. 2l).

        "text": "Quasi-periodic structures of natural biomaterial membranes have great potentials to serve as resonance cavities to generate ecological friendly optoelectronic devices with low cost. To achieve the first attempt for the illustration of the underlying principle, the Pieris canidia butterfly wing was embedded with ZnO nanoparticles. Quite interestingly, it is found that the bio-inspired quasi-single-mode random laser can be achieved by the assistance of the skeleton of the membrane, in which ZnO nanoparticles act as emitting gain media. Such unique characteristics can be interpreted well by the Fabry-Perot resonance existing in the window-like quasi-periodic structure of butterfly wing. Due to the inherently promising flexibility of butterfly wing membrane, the laser action can still be maintained during the bending process. Our demonstrated approach not only indicates that the natural biological structures can provide effective scattering feedbacks but also pave a new avenue towards designing bio-controlled photonic devices.

        "text": "A significant advantage of a graphene biosensor is that it inherently represents a continuum of independent and aligned sensor-units. We demonstrate a nanoscale version of a micro-physiometer \u2013 a device that measures cellular metabolic activity from the local acidification rate. Graphene functions as a matrix of independent pH sensors enabling subcellular detection of proton excretion. Raman spectroscopy shows that aqueous protons p-dope graphene \u2013 in agreement with established doping trajectories, and that graphene displays two distinct pKa values (2.9 and 14.2), corresponding to dopants physi- and chemisorbing to graphene respectively. The graphene physiometer allows micron spatial resolution and can differentiate immunoglobulin (IgG)-producing human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells from non-IgG-producing control cells. Population-based analyses allow mapping of phenotypic diversity, variances in metabolic activity, and cellular adhesion. Finally we show this platform can be extended to the detection of other analytes, e.g. dopamine. This work motivates the application of graphene as a unique biosensor for (sub)cellular interrogation. Subject terms: Biosensors\u2022 Optical properties and devices At a glance Figures View all figures Figure 1: (a) Schematic of experimental setup (not to scale). A 150 μl drop of unbuffered solution with a specific pH is deposited onto a monolayer of CVD graphene supported by a SiO2/Si wafer. A cover slip (not shown) is put on top to slow down evaporation of the solution. 121 spatially distinct Raman spectra of graphene were collected both before and after it was exposed to the solution. (b) Characteristic Raman spectra of bare graphene in air (blue), graphene exposed to 1 M NaOH (red) and graphene exposed to 1 M HCl (green), showing the 3 main graphene peaks (D, G, 2D). All spectra are normalized to G peak height; inset zooms in on the G peak region. Exposure of graphene to alkaline solution decreases its peak positions, whereas contact with an acidic solution increases its peak positions. (c) Transient response of the G peak position to NaOH. A 3 M NaOH solution is added to graphene previously exposed to water, thereby changing the pH from 4.5 to 14 (red). The G peak position is observed to shift rapidly. Addition of PBS to graphene already exposed to PBS (pH is unchanged) does not shift the G peak position (blue). An exposure time of 100 ms was used. Full size image View in article Figure 2: Scatter plots of Raman 2D peak position vs. G peak position (a), 2D to G intensity ratio vs. G peak position (b) and G peak width vs. G peak position (c) for graphene exposed to air (black dots) and solutions of different pH.Dashed lines are a guide to the eye adapted from ref. 23. The trend lines in (a) are shifted downwards to account for the dependence of the 2D peak position on the excitation wavelength (a 532 nm laser was used in ref. 23, as opposed to a 633 nm laser in this work). (d) Average hole concentration in graphene as a function of the pH of the solution in contact with graphene (red crosses). The hole concentration was deduced based on the relationship between GPOS and graphene dopant concentration, first shown in ref. 23 (see Fig. 3(b) in ref. 23). Dashed line represents independent binding events, whereas solid line represents negative cooperativity (with Hill coefficient n = 0.28). In the acidic regime the pre-hole-doped graphene becomes increasingly p-doped with decreasing pH, and it has a pKa value of 2.9. In the alkaline regime the OH− ions compensate for (part) of the pre-existing hole-doping in graphene, which reveals a second pKa value of graphene of 14.2. The two pKa values indicate two types of binding sites for H+ to graphene, each with a different strength: H+ physisorbing to negative puddles in graphene (e) and species forming covalent bonds with the graphene lattice (chemisorption). The diameter of the puddles in graphene on SiO2 is on the order of 20 nm, much smaller than the laser spot size (~1 μm diameter).

(d) Spatial Raman footprint of the cell shown optically in (b), obtained by probing the graphene G peak position: higher values are found under neath the cell, indicative of more doping.

        "text": "Magnetic graphene-based materials have shown great potential for developing high-performance electronic devices at sub-nanometer such as spintronic data storage units. However, a significant reduction of power consumption and great improvement of structural stability are needed before they can be used for actual applications. Based on the first-principles calculations, here we demonstrate that the interaction between tungsten atoms and nitrogenized-divacancies (NDVs) in the hybrid W@NDV-graphene can lead to high stability and large magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE). More importantly, reversible switching between different magnetic states can be implemented by tuning the MAE under different electric fields, and very low energy is consumed during the switching. Such controllable switching of magnetic states is ascribed to the competition between the tensile stain and orbital magnetic anisotropy, which originates from the change in the occupation number of W-5d orbitals under the electric fields. Our results provide a promising avenue for developing high-density magnetic storage units or multi-state logical switching devices with ultralow power at sub-nanometer.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) consisting of infinite crystalline lattices with metal clusters and organic linkers may provide opportunities for protease mimic which has remained unknown. Herein, we report that Cu2(C9H3O6)4/3 MOF (which is well known as HKUST-1 and denoted as Cu-MOF here), possesses an intrinsic enzyme mimicking activity similar to that found in natural trypsin to bovine serum albumin (BSA) and casein. The Michaelis constant (Km) of Cu-MOF is about 26,000-fold smaller than that of free trypsin indicating a much higher affinity of BSA for Cu-MOF surface. Cu-MOF also exhibited significantly higher catalytic efficiency than homogeneous artificial metalloprotease Cu(II) complexes and could be reused for ten times without losing in its activity. Moreover, Cu-MOF was successfully used to simulate trypsinization in cell culture since it dissociated cells in culture even without EDTA.

        "text": "To extend density limits in magnetic recording industry, two separate strategies were developed to build the storage bit in last decade, introduction of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and adoption of ferrimagnetism/antiferromagnetism. Meanwhile, these properties significantly improve device performance, such as reducing spin-transfer torque energy consumption and decreasing signal-amplitude-loss. However, materials combining PMA and antiferromagnetism rather than transition-metal/rare-earth system were rarely developed. Here, we develop a new type of ferrimagnetic superlattice exhibiting PMA based on abundant Heusler alloy families. The superlattice is formed by [MnGa/Co2FeAl] unit with their magnetizations antiparallel aligned. The effective anisotropy (Kueff) over 6 Merg/cm3 is obtained, and the SL can be easily built on various substrates with flexible lattice constants. The coercive force, saturation magnetization and Kueff of SLs are highly controllable by varying the thickness of MnGa and Co2FeAl layers. The SLs will supply a new choice for magnetic recording and spintronics memory application such as magnetic random access memory.

In this work, the stability and electronic structure of three-dimensional graphene-MoS2 (3DGM) hybrid structures are examined based on first-principle calculations. The results reveal that the 3DGMs can easily self-assembled by graphene nanosheet and zigzag MoS2 nanoribbons, and they are thermodynamically stable at room temperature. Interestingly, the electronic structures of 3DGM are greatly related to the configuration of joint zone. The 3DGM with odd-layer thickness MoS2 nanoribbon is semiconductor with a small band gap of 0.01\u20130.25 eV, while the one with even-layer thickness MoS2 nanoribbon exhibits metallic feature. More importantly, the 3DGM with zigzag MoS2 nanoribbon not only own the large surface area and effectively avoid the aggregation between the different nanoribbons, but also can remarkably enhance Li adsorption interaction, thus the 3DGM have the great potential as high performance lithium ion battery cathodes.

        "text": "The external performance of quantum optoelectronic devices is governed by the spatial profiles of electrons and potentials within the active regions of these devices. For example, in quantum cascade lasers (QCLs), the electric field domain (EFD) hypothesis posits that the potential distribution might be simultaneously spatially nonuniform and temporally unstable. Unfortunately, there exists no prior means of probing the inner potential profile directly. Here we report the nanoscale measured electric potential distribution inside operating QCLs by using scanning voltage microscopy at a cryogenic temperature. We prove that, per the EFD hypothesis, the multi-quantum-well active region is indeed divided into multiple sections having distinctly different electric fields. The electric field across these serially-stacked quantum cascade modules does not continuously increase in proportion to gradual increases in the applied device bias, but rather hops between discrete values that are related to tunneling resonances. We also report the evolution of EFDs, finding that an incremental change in device bias leads to a hopping-style shift in the EFD boundary \u2013 the higher electric field domain expands at least one module each step at the expense of the lower field domain within the active region.

(c), 1D SVM votlage profile curves at a series of device biases with a small incremental bias step (~10 ± 1 mV increase each time). The EFD boundary does not shift if the device bias increase is less than ~30 mV. When it does, the EFD boundary hops at least one module each time (a phenomenon we term EFD boundary hopping).

The delta-doped dopants are assumed to exponentially diffuse (by 48 Ang/decade) to the upstream direction of electron flux due to Si segregation during the molecular beam epitaxy of the QCL structure. The line running at GaAs conduction band edge (in gray and white) is the potential curve V(z) that the SVM tries to measure.

        "text": "Space-like separation of entangled quantum states is a central concept in fundamental investigations of quantum mechanics and in quantum communication applications. Optical approaches are ubiquitous in the distribution of entanglement because entangled photons are easy to generate and transmit. However, extending this direct distribution beyond a range of a few hundred kilometres1, 2 to a worldwide network is prohibited by losses associated with scattering, diffraction and absorption during transmission. A proposal to overcome this range limitation is the quantum repeater protocol3, 4, which involves the distribution of entangled pairs of optical modes among many quantum memories stationed along the transmission channel. To be effective, the memories must store the quantum information encoded on the optical modes for times that are long compared to the direct optical transmission time of the channel5. Here we measure a decoherence rate of 8 × 10−5 per second over 100 milliseconds, which is the time required for light transmission on a global scale. The measurements were performed on a ground-state hyperfine transition of europium ion dopants in yttrium orthosilicate (151Eu3+:Y2SiO5) using optically detected nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. The observed decoherence rate is at least an order of magnitude lower than that of any other system suitable for an optical quantum memory. Furthermore, by employing dynamic decoupling, a coherence time of 370 ± 60 minutes was achieved at 2 kelvin. It has been almost universally assumed that light is the best long-distance carrier for quantum information. However, the coherence time observed here is long enough that nuclear spins travelling at 9 kilometres per hour in a crystal would have a lower decoherence with distance than light in an optical fibre. This enables some very early approaches6, 7 to entanglement distribution to be revisited, in particular those in which the spins are transported rather than the light. Subject terms: Quantum information\u2022 Quantum optics\u2022 Quantum mechanics At a glance Figures Figure 1: Illustration of the ZEFOZ transition. Shown are the calculated hyperfine ground-state energy levels of 151Eu3+:Y2SiO5 as the applied magnetic field is increased from zero in the direction of the targeted zero first-order Zeeman (ZEFOZ) transition. This calculation used the reduced spin Hamiltonian in ref. 24. The doubly degenerate hyperfine states (I = ±1/2, ±3/2, ±5/2) are split by the applied field. At a field magnitude of 1.35 T in the appropriate direction, the marked transition experiences a critical point. At this ZEFOZ point, the transition is, to first order, insensitive to small field perturbations in any direction (although only one direction is shown). Figure 2: Experimental set-up and pulse sequences. a, The Eu3+:Y2SiO5 sample (3 × 3 × 5 mm) is oriented within a superconducting magnet contained in a liquid helium cryostat. The RF (radio frequency) coil is aligned perpendicular to the magnet. The light from a highly stabilized dye laser (sub-kHz linewidth) is directed at the sample from below the magnet, reflected by a mirror and finally detected by a 125 MHz bandwidth Si photo-receiver (\u2018Detector\u2019). b, The optical burn frequency ωb is used to prepare a population difference between the +3/2 and −3/2 states before the application of RF pulses and optically detect the spin echo signal. The re-pump frequency ωr = [(ωb \u2013 45 MHz) ωb], scanning over 45 MHz, is used to pump ions back to the +3/2 state. Sequence RF1 shows the RF pulses for phase sensitive detection with the polarity of a perturbing magnetic field reversed before the echo detection period; RF2 is for measuring the frozen core Y3+ dynamics where a perturbing πY-pulse is applied just before the europium π-pulse; RF3 is the CPMG pulse sequence; RF4 is the KDDx pulse sequence. c, The optical and RF frequencies used in b.

Each set is fitted using equation (2) with phase memory times TM equal to 47 s, 3.5 s and 0.8 s respectively. \u2018Plus\u2019 symbols show the two-pulse spin echo decay with the perturbing πY-pulse (sequence RF2 in Fig. 2b). At τ > 10 s, the decoherence rate is 5.3 × 10−2 s−1 from an exponential fit (that is, E(τ) ∝ exp(−τ/T2)). b, Illustration of the \u2018frozen core\u2019 effect. A large dipole moment (red arrow) is induced on the Eu ion due to the large external field. The field due to the induced moment then alters the Larmor frequency and the quantization axis of nearby Y nuclei to create a \u2018frozen core\u2019 of yttriums that cannot readily exchange spin with the bulk Y nuclei.

The error bars in b correspond to the shot-to-shot variations in the echo amplitude due to the preparation sequence that were observed at short delays. The uncertainty in the calculated T2 is obtained from the uncertainty in the linear fit.

        "text": "The inherent valley-contrasting optical selection rules for interband transitions at the K and K\u2032 valleys in monolayer MoS2 have attracted extensive interest. Carriers in these two valleys can be selectively excited by circularly polarized optical fields. The comprehensive dynamics of spin valley coupled polarization and polarized exciton are completely resolved in this work. Here, we present a systematic study of the ultrafast dynamics of monolayer MoS2 including spin randomization, exciton dissociation, free carrier relaxation, and electron-hole recombination by helicity- and photon energy-resolved transient spectroscopy. The time constants for these processes are 60 fs, 1 ps, 25 ps, and ~300 ps, respectively. The ultrafast dynamics of spin polarization, valley population, and exciton dissociation provides the desired information about the mechanism of radiationless transitions in various applications of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides. For example, spin valley coupled polarization provides a promising way to build optically selective-driven ultrafast valleytronics at room temperature. Therefore, a full understanding of the ultrafast dynamics in MoS2 is expected to provide important fundamental and technological perspectives.

        "text": "Quantum dynamics of light waves traveling through a time-varying turbulent plasma is investigated via the SU(1,1) Lie algebraic approach. Plasma oscillations that accompany time-dependence of electromagnetic parameters of the plasma are considered. In particular, we assume that the conductivity of plasma involves a sinusoidally varying term in addition to a constant one. Regarding the time behavior of electromagnetic parameters in media, the light fields are modeled as a modified CK (Caldirola-Kanai) oscillator that is more complex than the standard CK oscillator. Diverse quantum properties of the system are analyzed under the consideration of time-dependent characteristics of electromagnetic parameters. Quantum energy of the light waves is derived and compared with the counterpart classical energy. Gaussian wave packet of the field whose probability density oscillates with time like that of classical states is constructed through a choice of suitable initial condition and its quantum behavior is investigated in detail. Our development presented here provides a useful way for analyzing time behavior of quantized light in complex plasma.

        "text": "Waveguide array lenses are waveguide arrays that focus light incident on all waveguides at the input side into a small number of waveguides at the output side. Ideal waveguide array lenses provide complete (100%) power concentration of incident light into a single waveguide. While of great interest for several applications, ideal waveguide array lenses have not been demonstrated for practical arrays with large numbers of waveguides. The only waveguide arrays that have sufficient degrees of freedom to allow for the design of an ideal waveguide array lens are those where both the propagation constants of the individual waveguides and the coupling constants between the waveguides vary as a function of space. Here, we use state-of-the-art numerical methods to demonstrate complete power transfer into a single waveguide for waveguide array lenses with large numbers of waveguides. We verify this capability for more than a thousand waveguides using a spatial coupled mode theory. We hereby extend the state-of-art by more than two orders of magnitude. We also demonstrate for the first time a physical design for an ideal waveguide array lens. The design is based on an aperiodic metallic waveguide array and focuses ~100% of the incident light into a deep-subwavelength focal spot.

        "text": "Complex intra-molecular interactions and the hydrogen-bonding network in H2O-volatile mixtures play critical roles in many dynamics processes in physical chemistry, biology, and Earth and planetary sciences. We used high pressure Raman spectroscopy to study the pressure evolution of vibrational frequencies and bonding behavior in H2O-CH3OH mixtures. We found that the presence of low CH3OH content in H2O increases the transition pressure where water crystallizes to ice VI, but does not significantly change the pressure where ice VI transforms to ice VII. Furthermore, the stiffening rates of C-H stretching frequencies dω/dP in CH3OH significantly decrease upon the crystallization of water, and the softening rates of the O-H stretching frequencies of ice VII are suppressed over a narrow pressure range, after which the frequencies of these modes shift with pressure in ways similar to pure CH3OH and ice VII, respectively. Such complex pressure evolution of Raman frequencies along with pronounced variations in Raman intensities of CH3OH within the sample, and the hysteresis of the water-ice VI phase transition suggest pressure-induced segregation of low content CH3OH from ice VII. These findings indicate the significant influence of volatiles on the crystallization of sub-surface ocean and thermal evolution within large icy planets and satellites.

During the decompression, the ice VII transforms back to the ice VI (open triangles) at approximately the same pressure as being compressed; the ice VI, however, experiences a hysteresis and melts to water around 0.9 GPa (open diamonds), independent of the CH3OH wt%. Full size image View in article Figure 8: Raman shifts of the C-H stretching modes of CH3OH as a function of pressure and CH3OH wt % during (a) compression and (b) decompression cycles. The 100 wt%, pure CH3OH shows an approximately constant slope dω/dP in both compression and decompression cycles. The frequencies of both C-H modes for 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 wt% CH3OH are higher than those for pure CH3OH at ambient pressure, and initially increase linearly with a similar slope larger than those of pure CH3OH until the crystallization of water, in which the slopes all become very small. The frequencies then increase again at higher pressures with a slope similar to those of the pure CH3OH. The pressure induced frequency shifts in pure CH3OH are reversible over the pressure range studied, whereas the frequency shifts in all low CH3OH content mixtures are only reversible until around 1\u20132 GPa, where a hysteresis water-ice VI transition occurs and the small slopes of the C-H stretching modes of all low CH3OH content mixtures increase around 1 GPa.

        "text": "Inducing robust magnetic moments on the basal plane of the graphene sheet is very difficult, and is one of the greatest challenges in the study of physical chemistry of graphene materials. Theoretical studies predicted that introduction of a kind of sp3-type defects formed by OH groups is an effective pathway to achieve this goal [Boukhvalov, D. W. & Katsnelson, M. I. ACS Nano 5, 2440\u20132446 (2011)]. Here we demonstrate that OH groups can efficiently induce robust magnetic moments on the basal plane of the graphene sheet. We show that the inducing efficiency can reach as high as 217 μB per 1000 OH groups. More interestingly, the magnetic moments are robust and can survive even at 900°C. Our findings highlight the importance of OH group as an effective sp3-type candidate for inducing robust magnetic moments on the basal plane of the graphene sheet.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information Icosahedral quasicrystals (IQCs) are a form of matter that is ordered but not periodic in any direction. All reported IQCs are intermetallic compounds and either of face-centred-icosahedral or primitive-icosahedral type, and the positions of their atoms have been resolved from diffraction data. However, unlike axially symmetric quasicrystals, IQCs have not been observed in non-atomic (that is, micellar or nanoparticle) systems, where real-space information would be directly available. Here, we show that an IQC can be assembled by means of molecular dynamics simulations from a one-component system of particles interacting via a tunable, isotropic pair potential extending only to the third-neighbour shell. The IQC is body-centred, self-assembles from a fluid phase, and in parameter space neighbours clathrates and other tetrahedrally bonded crystals. Our findings elucidate the structure and dynamics of the IQC, and suggest routes to search for it and design it in soft matter and nanoscale systems. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Self-assembly of a one-component icosahedral quasicrystal. a, Isotropic particles (shown in red, green and blue) form a roughly spherical solid that coexists with the gas phase. The central particles (green) align into rows and show ordered tiling (red with grey bonds). b\u2013d, Diffraction patterns along five-fold (b), three-fold (c) and two-fold (d) axes exhibit Bragg peaks and weak diffuse scattering. The Bragg peaks align well along two-fold sections, demonstrating the absence of phason strain. Potential parameters for this figure are in the LD subregion: (k, ) = (6.25, 0.62). The system contains 20,000 particles. Figure 2: Characterization and dynamics of the quasicrystal. a, Particles projected along a five-fold axis are arranged into a pentagonal Penrose tiling. b, Projection of the particles along a two-fold symmetry axis reveals orthogonal layers that are separated by long (L) and short (S) intervals arranged into a Fibonacci sequence. c, Self-similar triangular patches related by the golden mean τ appear in projection along a three-fold axis. d\u2013g, The particles are highly mobile, as confirmed by changes in the Penrose tiling. We show snapshots after 10 (d), 20 (e), 50 (f) and 100 (g) million simulation time steps. a and f show the same time step. h, The particles are highly mobile, as confirmed by the van Hove autocorrelation function Ga projected along a five-fold axis. The observed phason flips allow the quasicrystal to equilibrate efficiently. Figure 3: Crystalline phases competing with the quasicrystal. Crystal structures found in slow-cooling simulations from the gas phase as a function of the potential parameters (k, ) are summarized in an assembly map (central part of the figure). Eight crystalline phases (arranged around the assembly map) compete with a region where spontaneous ordering was not observed (shaded in grey) and with a region of icosahedral order (shaded in red). The icosahedral region is further divided into a low-density (LD) subregion, an intermediate-density (ID) subregion and a high-density (HD) subregion. For each crystal structure the radial pair correlation function at elevated temperature g(r) (red curve) and the pair potential V (r) (blue curve) are plotted at the parameters (k, ) of V (r) indicated by the corresponding brown triangular arrow. A bond orientational order diagram and a representative part of the crystal structure are shown above each plot. Figure 4: Appearance of high-symmetry clusters in the icosahedral quasicrystal. a\u2013c, Pair potential V (r), radial pair correlation function g(r) and bond orientational order diagram in the LD (a), ID (b) and HD (c) subregions. d,f, Two-shell clusters are found in the ID quasicrystal (d) and the HD approximant crystal (f). Icosahedral symmetry is broken in the approximant. e, As the density ρ increases, the coordination number increases from predominantly four-fold coordinated (LD) to predominantly seven-fold coordinated (HD). g,j, Simulation snapshots in the ID (g) and HD (j) subregions. Prolate and oblate Penrose rhombohedra are obtained in projection by connecting the cluster centres. h,i, The diffraction pattern of the ID quasicrystal along the five-fold axis (h) has ten-fold symmetry, whereas the Bragg peak positions in the diffraction pattern of the HD approximant along the pseudo-five-fold axis form a lattice (i) demonstrating the periodicity of the approximant. Potential parameters are for LD: (k, ) = (6.25, 0.62), ID: (k, ) = (7.5, 0.53), HD: (k, ) = (8.5, 0.68). Figure 5: Geometric modelling and structure solution of the icosahedral quasicrystal using higher-dimensional crystallography. a, Occupation domains are reconstructed by lifting the particle positions obtained in simulation onto a six-dimensional body-centred hypercubic lattice. The occupation domain for the LD quasicrystal and the ID quasicrystal are distinct in geometry. Both have icosahedral symmetry and can be modelled in a first approximation as a dodecahedron. b, The comparison of radial density profiles of the occupation domains obtained from simulation with the scaled dodecahedron model reveals thermal broadening of the occupation domain via phason flips. c, The icosahedral quasicrystal can be reconstructed from the model via projection from six dimensions. The peaks of the model (red) point in the direction of the vertices of a dodecahedron (label \u2018D\u2019, 3-fold axes), an icosahedron (\u2018I\u2019, 5-fold), a rhombic triacontahedron (\u2018T\u2019, 2-fold) and a truncated icosahedron (\u2018TI\u2019). Primes in the label distinguish higher shells related to another by scaling with the golden mean τ. After relaxation (energy minimization) the radial pair correlation function g(r) of the LD quasicrystal is well reproduced. d, The potential energy of a particle in the LD quasicrystal is correlated to its position within the occupation domain. Particles close to the centre of the occupation domain have lowest potential energy. The potential energy decreases towards the surface of the occupation domain.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information Cooperative coupling between optical emitters and light fields is one of the outstanding goals in quantum technology. It is both fundamentally interesting for the extraordinary radiation properties of the participating emitters and has many potential applications in photonics. Although this goal has been achieved using high-finesse optical cavities, attention has turned to broadband, easy to build cavity-free approaches. Here we demonstrate cooperative coupling of ultracold atoms with surface plasmons propagating on a plane gold surface. While the atoms are moving towards the surface they are excited by an external laser pulse. The interaction between the excited atom fluorescence and surface plasmons is probed by detecting the photons emitted into the substrate when the plasmon excitations decay. A maximum Purcell factor of ηP = 4.9 is reached at an optimum distance of z = 250 nm from the surface. The coupling leads to the observation of a Fano-like resonance in the spectrum. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Schematic drawing of the experimental situation. a, An atom situated close to a metal surface emits photons radiatively with rate γrad into free space and non-radiatively with rate γsp into surface plasmons propagating on the metal surface with wavenumber ksp. b, Surface plasmons on a thin metal film couple to the far field in the dielectric substrate by leakage radiation. The emitted light field is p-polarized. A detector collects photons under the solid angle ΔΩ. c, In the experiment a cloud of ultracold rubidium atoms is positioned very close to a gold film and is illuminated by a laser field. Photons that are emitted into the substrate are collected by an optical fibre coupler (FC) under an adjustable angle θ and are detected with an avalanche photodiode (APD) with single-photon sensitivity. The polarization of the detected light can be switched between s and p by a λ/2 wave plate and a polarizing beam cube (PBC). Figure 2: Radiation properties of a rubidium atom at a gold surface. a, Emission rates of a rubidium atom with an orthogonal dipole moment at a distance z from a gold surface. Red line: radiative emission into the far field (γrad). Blue solid line: non-radiative emission into surface plasmons (γsp). Blue dashed line: non-radiative emission into evanescent waves (γew). All rates are normalized to the free-space emission rate γ0. b, Purcell enhancement factor ηP = γsp/(γrad + γew) for a vertical dipole (red line) and a parallel dipole (blue line). The right axis corresponds to the black solid line and indicates the number of atoms in 100-nm-thick slices. More information on the atomic density is contained in the Methods. c, Radiation coefficient for emission into an angle θ within the substrate. The solid (dashed) line corresponds to a vertical dipole at a distance of z = 250 (500) nm from a d = 50-nm-thick gold layer on top of a sapphire substrate. The dielectric constants at the relevant wavelength of λ = 780 nm are ε1 = − 22.9 + i ⋅ 1.42 for gold and ε2 = 3.0625 for sapphire. Obviously, the surface plasmons are coupled into far-field radiation in the sapphire substrate with high directionality under the plasmon angle θpl. The angle of total reflection θth is that for an interface from sapphire to vacuum. Details on all of the simulations are contained in the Supplementary Information. Figure 3: Measured photon numbers. a, Number of detected p- and s-polarized photons at an angle of θ − θth = 0.9° above the gold surface and above the plain sapphire substrate. The position z0 is the distance of the cloud centre to the surface. b, The photon number difference ΔNdet = Ndetp − Ndets at a distance of z0 = 41 μm has a maximum at the plasmon angle above gold. The solid line is a simulation of non-radiative coupling of the atomic emission to the surface plasmon mode. The only fit parameter in this simulation is a loss factor ηadd = 0.36 comprising the fibre coupling efficiency of the emitted light and additional losses at optical elements (see Methods). Above the plain sapphire substrate no maximum is observed. The increase for small angles can be attributed to Fresnel transmission of light through surface roughness. The red dashed line is based on a simulation of Fresnel transmission (Supplementary Information). The error bars correspond to the standard deviation of approximately 40 measurements for each data point. Figure 4: Measured spectrum. Red circles show the detected photon number Ndetp at an emission angle of θ − θth = 0.9° and trap distance z0 = 41 μm. The data points are fitted by a model (solid line) including a constant offset Aoffset, a Lorentzian curve with amplitude Ascatt due to photons scattered by atoms far away from the surface and cooperatively coupled photons due to atoms very close to the surface that lead to a Fano profile (black solid line). The dashed line corresponds to the spectrum without the Fano contribution. For comparison, a reference spectrum (blue circles, in arbitrary units (a.u.)) was recorded simultaneously by saturation spectroscopy in a rubidium vapour cell. The error bars correspond to the standard deviation of approximately 40 measurements for each data point.

There exist three kinds of LLs, i.e., well-behaved, perturbed and undefined LLs, which are characterized by a specific mode, a main mode plus side modes, and a disordered mode, respectively.

Under the application of high current density, we found that the Walker breakdown phenomenon is suppressed in the sandwich structure.

        "text": "Solution-processed optoelectronic and electronic devices are attractive owing to the potential for low-cost fabrication of large-area devices and the compatibility with lightweight, flexible plastic substrates. Solution-processed light-emitting diodes (LEDs) using conjugated polymers or quantum dots as emitters have attracted great interest over the past two decades1, 2. However, the overall performance of solution-processed LEDs2, 3, 4, 5\u2014including their efficiency, efficiency roll-off at high current densities, turn-on voltage and lifetime under operational conditions\u2014remains inferior to that of the best vacuum-deposited organic LEDs6, 7, 8. Here we report a solution-processed, multilayer quantum-dot-based LED with excellent performance and reproducibility. It exhibits colour-saturated deep-red emission, sub-bandgap turn-on at 1.7 volts, high external quantum efficiencies of up to 20.5 per cent, low efficiency roll-off (up to 15.1 per cent of the external quantum efficiency at 100 mA cm−2), and a long operational lifetime of more than 100,000 hours at 100 cd m−2, making this device the best-performing solution-processed red LED so far, comparable to state-of-the-art vacuum-deposited organic LEDs2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. This optoelectronic performance is achieved by inserting an insulating layer between the quantum dot layer and the oxide electron-transport layer to optimize charge balance in the device and preserve the superior emissive properties of the quantum dots. We anticipate that our results will be a starting point for further research, leading to high-performance, all-solution-processed quantum-dot-based LEDs ideal for next-generation display and solid-state lighting technologies.

The thickness of the ZnO layer is 300 nm. The electron mobility of the ZnO film is obtained by fitting space-charge-limited-current region (J ∝ V2) with Child\u2019s law, , where ε0, εr, μe and d are the vacuum permittivity, relative permittivity, electron mobility and film thickness, respectively17.

For each layer, the height image, the line-scan profile, the pseudo-three-dimensional image and the phase image are shown. Note that the surface root mean squared values may change owing to the tip-to-tip and sample-to-sample variations. Extensive AFM measurements show that the root mean squared roughnesses for the quantum dot layer and the PMMA layer are in the ranges of 1.6\u20132.6 nm and 0.6\u20131.6 nm, respectively.

Note that the data have been linearly fitted to show the spatial uniformity. Extended Data Fig. 5: FTIR analyses to determine the average thickness of the PMMA layers used in the QLEDs. The sample for FTIR measurements was produced by layer-by-layer spin-coating the PVK (in m-xylene, 1.5 mg ml−1), quantum dots (in octane, 15 mg ml−1) and PMMA (in acetone, 1.8 mg ml−1) at 2,000 r.p.m. onto the cleaned CaF2 substrates. We assume that the average thickness of the PMMA layer in this sample is identical to that of the PMMA layer in the optimized QLEDs. The absorption of the carbonylic groups of this sample was measured multiple times, averaged and compared with that of a 90 nm PMMA film (determined by stylus profilometer). Given that the absorbance of the carbonylic groups is in the dynamic range of the instrument, the thickness of the PMMA layer deposited onto the quantum dot film was determined to be ~6 nm. Extended Data Fig. 6: Electrical measurements on the electron-only devices (ITO/Al/QDs/ZnO/Al) and the hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/poly-TPD/PVK/QDs/Pd). The current density of the electron-only device (ITO/Al/QDs/ZnO/Al) is more than one order of magnitude greater than that of the hole-only device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/poly-TPD/PVK/QDs/Pd). In the above two devices, the thicknesses of all layers are identical to those used in the QLEDs. For the quantum dot layer, the thickness is ~40 nm. We note that for quasi-type-II CdSe\u2013CdS quantum dots, the electron wavefunction extends to the shell region, whereas the hole wavefunction remains confined to the CdSe core, leading to greater electron mobility than hole mobility. We presume that the recombination zone is close to the PVK/QDs interface due to the very low hole mobility of the quantum dot films. Therefore we also fabricated a hole-only device with a quantum dot layer of ~20 nm. The results show that the current density of the hole-only device with the 20 nm quantum dot layer is still much smaller than that of the electron-only device with the 40 nm quantum dot layer.

        "text": "Strain control is one of the most promising avenues to search for new emergent phenomena in transition-metal-oxide films. Here, we investigate the strain-induced changes of electronic structures in strongly correlated LaNiO3 (LNO) films, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and the dynamical mean-field theory. The strongly renormalized eg-orbital bands are systematically rearranged by misfit strain to change its fermiology. As tensile strain increases, the hole pocket centered at the A point elongates along the kz-axis and seems to become open, thus changing Fermi-surface (FS) topology from three- to quasi-two-dimensional. Concomitantly, the FS shape becomes flattened to enhance FS nesting. A FS superstructure with Q1 = (1/2,1/2,1/2) appears in all LNO films, while a tensile-strained LNO film has an additional Q2 = (1/4,1/4,1/4) modulation, indicating that some instabilities are present in metallic LNO films. Charge disproportionation and spin-density-wave fluctuations observed in other nickelates might be their most probable origins.

        "text": "RF/microwave soft magnetic films (SMFs) are key materials for miniaturization and multifunctionalization of monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) and their components, which demand that the SMFs should have higher self-bias ferromagnetic resonance frequency fFMR, and can be fabricated in an IC compatible process. However, self-biased metallic SMFs working at X-band or higher frequency were rarely reported, even though there are urgent demands. In this paper, we report an IC compatible process with two-step superposition to prepare SMFs, where the FeCoB SMFs were deposited on (011) lead zinc niobate\u2013lead titanate substrates using a composition gradient sputtering method. As a result, a giant magnetic anisotropy field of 1498 Oe, 1\u20132 orders of magnitude larger than that by conventional magnetic annealing method, and an ultrahigh fFMR of up to 12.96 GHz reaching Ku-band, were obtained at zero magnetic bias field in the as-deposited films. These ultrahigh microwave performances can be attributed to the superposition of two effects: uniaxial stress induced by composition gradient and magnetoelectric coupling. This two-step superposition method paves a way for SMFs to surpass X-band by two-step or multi-step, where a variety of magnetic anisotropy field enhancing methods can be cumulated together to get higher ferromagnetic resonance frequency.

        "text": "The return of supercooled water to a stable equilibrium condition is an irreversible process which, in large enough samples, takes place adiabatically. We investigated this phenomenon in water by fast imaging techniques. As water freezes, large energy and density fluctuations promote the spatial coexistence of solid and liquid phases at different temperatures. Upon synchronously monitoring the time evolution of the local temperature, we observed a sharp dynamic transition between a fast and a slow decay regime at about 266.6 K. We construe the observed phenomenon in terms of the temperature dependence of heat transfers from solid and liquid volumes already at their bulk coexistence temperature towards adjacent still supercooled liquid regions. These findings can be justified by observing that convective motions induced by thermal gradients in a supercooled liquid near coexistence are rapidly suppressed as the nucleated solid fraction overcomes, at low enough temperatures, a characteristic percolation threshold.

Two Raman peaks, which depend strongly not only on electric potential but also on the local surface plasmon resonances (LSPR), have been observed. Theoretical calculations reveal that thioanisole is first dissociated from thiophenol via the S-CH3 bond; plasmons then drive the dimerisation of thiophenol via the S-S bond, which is strongly potential dependent. One Raman peak corresponds to the S-S vibrational mode of the thiophenol dimer, and the other corresponds to the asymmetric C-C stretching modes of the benzenyl of the thiophenol dimer. The potential-dependent two Raman modes is the potential-dependent dimerisation dynamics of thiophenol via the S-S bond. Our experimental findings provide insight into the structural elucidation of adsorbed molecules and molecular surface reaction dynamics.

Herein, it is re-built by using a ceramic Li-ion exchange film to separate Cu and Zn electrodes for preventing Cu2+-crossover between two electrodes. The re-built Zn-Cu battery can be cycled for 150 times without capacity attenuation and self-discharge, and displays a theoretical energy density of 68.3 Wh kg−1. It is more important that both electrodes of the battery are renewable, reusable, low toxicity and environmentally friendly.

        "text": "A critical challenge for the integration of optoelectronics is that photodetectors have relatively poor sensitivities at the nanometer scale. Generally, a large electrodes spacing in photodetectors is required to absorb sufficient light to maintain high photoresponsivity and reduce the dark current. However, this will limit the optoelectronic integration density. Through spatially resolved photocurrent investigation, we find that the photocurrent in metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors based on layered GaSe is mainly generated from the region close to the metal-GaSe interface with higher electrical potential. The photoresponsivity monotonically increases with shrinking the spacing distance before the direct tunneling happens, which was significantly enhanced up to 5,000 AW−1 for the bottom Ti/Au contacted device. It is more than 1,700-fold improvement over the previously reported results. The response time of the Ti/Au contacted devices is about 10\u201320 ms and reduced down to 270 μs for the devices with single layer graphene as metallic electrodes. A theoretical model has been developed to well explain the photoresponsivity for these two types of device configurations. Our findings realize reducing the size and improving the performance of 2D semiconductor based MSM photodetectors simultaneously, which could pave the way for future high density integration of optoelectronics with high performances.

While small, cost-efficient dominating sets play a significant role in controllability and observability of these networks, a fixed and intact network structure is always implicitly assumed. We find that cost-efficiency of dominating sets optimized for small size alone comes at a price of being vulnerable to damage; domination in the remaining network can be severely disrupted, even if a small fraction of dominator nodes are lost. We develop two new methods for finding flexible dominating sets, allowing either adjustable overall resilience, or dominating set size, while maximizing the dominated fraction of the remaining network after the attack.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator (TI) is a quantum state of matter with a gapped insulating bulk yet a conducting surface hosting topologically protected gapless surface states. One of the most distinct electronic transport signatures predicted for such topological surface states (TSS) is a well-defined half-integer quantum Hall effect (QHE) in a magnetic field, where the surface Hall conductivities become quantized in units of (1/2)e2/h (e being the electron charge, h the Planck constant) concomitant with vanishing resistance. Here, we observe a well-developed QHE arising from TSS in an intrinsic TI of BiSbTeSe2. Our samples exhibit surface-dominated conduction even close to room temperature, whereas the bulk conduction is negligible. At low temperatures and high magnetic fields perpendicular to the top and bottom surfaces, we observe well-developed integer quantized Hall plateaux, where the two parallel surfaces each contribute a half-integer e2/h quantized Hall conductance, accompanied by vanishing longitudinal resistance. When the bottom surface is gated to match the top surface in carrier density, only odd integer QH plateaux are observed, representing a half-integer QHE of two degenerate Dirac gases. This system provides an excellent platform to pursue a plethora of exotic physics and novel device applications predicted for TIs, ranging from magnetic monopoles and Majorana particles to dissipationless electronics and fault-tolerant quantum computers.

At T = 2 K, the sheet resistance exhibits a 2D behaviour (relatively insensitive to the thickness, highlighted by the blue horizontal band). The dashed line and red horizontal band represent expected behaviours for Rsh and ρ3D of a 3D bulk conductor (our data at 290 K exhibited such 3D behaviour for samples thicker than ≳100 nm). c, Surface to total conductance ratio (Gsur/Gtot) as a function of the sample thickness at three representative temperatures. Here Gtot is the measured conductance and Gsur is extracted from fitting the measured Rsh versus T (see text and Supplementary Fig. 6 for details, the few Gsur/Gtot exceeding unity by a few per cent is a result of the fit slightly overestimating the measured data). d, Predicted Gsur/Gtot (shown in colour scale) for our BSTS as a function of temperature and sample thickness. Here Gsur and Gtot are calculated based on the bulk and surface conductivities averaged from multiple measured devices (see text and Supplementary Fig. 6 for details). Black dashed curves are contours for a few Gsur/Gtot values. Figure 2: Electric field effect and gate-tuned quantum Hall effect (QHE) in BSTS. a, Representative electric field effect curve, showing the resistance Rxx measured as a function of Vbg in Sample A (a 160-nm-thick exfoliated BSTS flake). Inset is the device schematic, where the doped Si substrate (with 300 nm SiO2 overlayer) is used as a backgate (Vbg denotes the gate voltage applied) to tune the carrier density nb (and thus the chemical potential μb) of the bottom surface of the BSTS. Also depicted are the Dirac surface state bands for top and bottom surfaces, respectively. b, Longitudinal resistance (Rxx) and Hall resistance (Rxy) versus backgate voltage (Vbg) measured at B = 31 T in Sample A (inset shows an optical microscope image of the device) at 0.35 K. c, Extracted 2D longitudinal and Hall conductivities (σxx and σxy at 31 T along with −σxy at −31 T), in units of e2/h. Plateaux observed in Rxy (at values of h/νe2) and σxy (at νe2/h) are labelled by the corresponding total Landau filling factors (ν, which are integers, with corresponding sum of top and bottom surface half-integer fillings also labelled in Fig. 2c) of the quantum Hall states. Arrows mark the minima or inflection in σxx. d, A 2D colour plot showing σxx (colour scale) as a function of magnetic field (B) and back gate voltage (Vbg) measured at 0.35 K in sample A. A series of σxx versus Vbg curves (measured in steps of 2 T) are interpolated to generate this 2D plot. Dashed and dotted lines correspond to half-integer and integer Landau filling factors (marked) for the bottom surface, respectively. Inset: the Vbg positions for minima in σxx (left axis) and (Vbg − VD)/ΔV (right axis) as a function of ν at 31 T, where ΔV is half the averaged Vbg separation between two consecutive Landau levels. Figure 3: Magnetic field tuned QHE. a, Rxx (bottom) and Rxy (top) as functions of B at various Vbg values. Several observed quantum Hall plateaux are marked by dashed lines with corresponding total Landau filling factors ν (top). b, Landau fan diagram for the bottom surface for various different Vbg values. Data shown with filled markers are extracted from Rxx(B) whereas those shown with open markers are from the derivative of Rxy(B) (an example at Vbg = −20 V is shown in the inset). Examples of extracted data points are marked in the inset and the Rxx trace for Vbg = −35 V in a. Only data with B ≳ 13 T (where the top surface is at its zeroth LL) are used. Lines denote linear fits with Nb-axis intercepts ~−1/2 for all datasets. c, Measurements were performed in a different cool-down with different carrier densities. Magnetic field (B) dependence of Rxx and Rxy measured at Vbg = −28 V, where nb is tuned to match nt (top surface carrier density) such that the LL index N = Nt = Nb. Inset shows a LL fan diagram, where integers N (half-integers N + 1/2) are assigned to index minima (maxima) in Rxx oscillations. A linear fit gives the intercept −0.5 on the N-axis. All data in a\u2013c are measured in sample A at 0.35 K. Figure 4: QHE measured in a different sample and temperature dependence. Measurements were performed in Sample B, an 80-nm-thick exfoliated BSTS flake. a, Vbg-dependent Rxx and Rxy measured at B = 31 T and four different temperatures (4.5 K, 10 K, 35 K and 50 K). Vertical dot-dashed lines indicate the position of the QH state at total filling factor ν = 1. b, σxx (log scale) as a function of inverse temperature (1/T) at ν = 1. Blue dashed line indicates a fit at higher temperature with σxx ∝ exp(−E0/kT). c, ΔRxy versus Rxx at ν = 1. Blue dashed line indicates a linear fit.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information On the basis of successful first-principles predictions of new functional ferroelectric materials, a number of new ferroelectrics have been experimentally discovered. Using trilinear coupling of two types of octahedron rotation, hybrid improper ferroelectricity has been theoretically predicted in ordered perovskites and the Ruddlesden\u2013Popper compounds (Ca3Ti2O7, Ca3Mn2O7 and (Ca/Sr/Ba)3(Sn/Zr/Ge)2O7). However, the ferroelectricity of these compounds has never been experimentally confirmed and even their polar nature has been under debate. Here we provide the first experimental demonstration of room-temperature switchable polarization in bulk crystals of Ca3Ti2O7, as well as Sr-doped Ca3Ti2O7. Furthermore, (Ca, Sr)3Ti2O7 is found to exhibit an intriguing ferroelectric domain structure resulting from orthorhombic twins and (switchable) planar polarization. The planar domain structure accompanies abundant charged domain walls with conducting head-to-head and insulating tail-to-tail configurations, which exhibit a conduction difference of two orders of magnitude. These discoveries provide new research opportunities, not only for new stable ferroelectrics of Ruddlesden\u2013Popper compounds, but also for meandering conducting domain walls formed by planar polarization. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Planar electric polarization of Ca3−xSrxTi2O7 single crystals at room temperature. a,b, Crystallographic structure of Ca3−xSrxTi2O7 with the orthorhombic A21am space group. The red (blue), white (dark green), and light-blue spheres represent Ca/Sr in the Rock-salt R block (perovskite P block), planar (apical) oxygen of the TiO6 octahedra, and Ti at the centre of the TiO6 octahedra, respectively.

FA DWs (orthorhombic twin boundaries) are oriented along the diagonal direction of the xy scanning axes, and the long axis of the AFM cantilever is oriented along the vertical (horizontal) direction, as depicted in the top (bottom) panels of a and b. White and black arrows show the directions of planar polarization, and grey arrows on the outside of the panels indicate the FA DWs. c,d, The schematic pictures in the middle depict possible DW angles with respect to the polarization direction (black arrows). Edges of the diamond (octagon) in the middle schematics and thick dashed lines in the crystallographic cartoons correspond to FA (FE) DWs. Different colours of DWs represent different amounts of localized charges due to polarization surface charges. The DW angle (θ) is defined as the angle of the DW with respect to the coordinates shown in d. Positive and negative signs of θ in d indicate head-to-head and tail-to-tail configurations, respectively. For the FA DWs in c, θFA = +135° and −45° correspond to anticlockwise and clockwise rotations of the head-to-tail polarization at the DWs, respectively. Panels with crystallographic cartoons show local distortions for four different DW angles of FA DWs and eight different DW angles of FE DWs. Red/blue, pink, cyan and green solid circles indicate displaced Ca/Sr, non-displaced Ca/Sr, Ti and O ions, respectively (consistent with those in Fig. 1a,b), and the planar O ions are omitted.

Colour scale depicts the magnitude of the measured cAFM current. c, Angular dependence of the conductance of FE (green open/filled circles) and FA (solid coloured diamonds) DWs. The conductance is normalized as Gnorm(δ) = (Iwall(δ) −Ibulk)/Ibulk, where Iwall(δ) is the measured current at the DW and the averaged current at domain, Ibulk, is 0.2 nA. The selected DWs for the analysis of the angular dependence of the DW conductance are outlined with white dashed lines in the inset. Orange, light-blue and grey diamonds depict the normalized conductance of FA DWs with θFA = +45°, −135° and +135°/−45°, respectively. The black curve is the calculated angular dependence of the normalized conductance (see the text for details). d, I\u2013V curve (red) at one spot on a head-to-head FE DW (the red dot numbered 1 in b) and I\u2013V curve (blue) at one spot on a tail-to-tail FE DW (the blue dot numbered 2 in b). The inset depicts the current profile while a cAFM tip scans across four types of FA DWs.

        "text": "The realization of a future quantum Internet requires the processing and storage of quantum information at local nodes and interconnecting distant nodes using free-space and fibre-optic links1. Quantum memories for light2 are key elements of such quantum networks. However, to date, neither an atomic quantum memory for non-classical states of light operating at a wavelength compatible with standard telecom fibre infrastructure, nor a fibre-based implementation of a quantum memory, has been reported. Here, we demonstrate the storage and faithful recall of the state of a 1,532 nm wavelength photon entangled with a 795 nm photon, in an ensemble of cryogenically cooled erbium ions doped into a 20-m-long silica fibre, using a photon-echo quantum memory protocol. Despite its currently limited efficiency and storage time, our broadband light\u2013matter interface brings fibre-based quantum networks one step closer to reality. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Experimental set-up. a, Schematic set-up, consisting of three parts: source of entangled photon pairs, quantum memory and analysers (including a coincidence unit) that allow projection of the joint photon state onto qubit product states. Depending on the measurement, the entangled photons are either directly sent towards the analysers, or the 1,532 nm photon is first stored for 5 ns in an erbium-doped fibre. b, Source of time-bin entangled photon pairs.

To generate AFCs, we frequency-selectively transfer population from the 4I15/2 electronic ground state (|g〉) through the 4I13/2 excited state (|e〉) into an auxiliary state . b, Typical AFC. The total AFC bandwidth is 8 GHz (only 6 GHz are shown), and the peak spacing is 200 MHz, leading to 5-ns-long storage. The variation of the AFC's envelope is an artefact. c, Photon storage. Photons (1,532 nm wavelength) in a single temporal mode are stored and retrieved after 5 ns with ∼1% efficiency (for more details see Supplementary Section 3) and detected by an SNSPD. Also shown are detections due to directly transmitted (that is, not absorbed) photons. The detection-time jitter of the detector used for this measurement is ∼800 ps, which restricts one from observing the true duration of the original and re-emitted photons (∼44 and 55 ps, respectively).

        "text": "We propose a method to control electromagnetic (EM) radiations by holographic metasurfaces, including to producing multi-beam scanning in one dimension (1D) and two dimensions (2D) with the change of frequency. The metasurfaces are composed of subwavelength metallic patches on grounded dielectric substrate. We present a combined theory of holography and leaky wave to realize the multi-beam radiations by exciting the surface interference patterns, which are generated by interference between the excitation source and required radiation waves. As the frequency changes, we show that the main lobes of EM radiation beams could accomplish 1D or 2D scans regularly by using the proposed holographic metasurfaces shaped with different interference patterns. This is the first time to realize 2D scans of antennas by changing the frequency. Full-wave simulations and experimental results validate the proposed theory and confirm the corresponding physical phenomena.

        "text": "Development of multidrug resistance (MDR) is an almost universal phenomenon in patients with ovarian cancer, and this severely limits the ultimate success of chemotherapy in the clinic. Overexpression of the MDR1 gene and corresponding P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is one of the best known MDR mechanisms. MDR1 siRNA based strategies were proposed to circumvent MDR, however, systemic, safe, and effective targeted delivery is still a major challenge. Cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) targeted hyaluronic acid (HA) based nanoparticle has been shown to successfully deliver chemotherapy agents or siRNAs into tumor cells. The goal of this study is to evaluate the ability of HA-PEI/HA-PEG to deliver MDR1 siRNA and the efficacy of the combination of HA-PEI/HA-PEG/MDR1 siRNA with paclitaxel to suppress growth of ovarian cancer. We observed that HA-PEI/HA-PEG nanoparticles can efficiently deliver MDR1 siRNA into MDR ovarian cancer cells, resulting in down-regulation of MDR1 and Pgp expression. Administration of HA-PEI/HA-PEG/MDR1 siRNA nanoparticles followed by paclitaxel treatment induced a significant inhibitory effect on the tumor growth, decreased Pgp expression and increased apoptosis in MDR ovarian cancer mice model. Our findings suggest that CD44 targeted HA-PEI/HA-PEG/MDR1 siRNA nanoparticles can serve as a therapeutic tool with great potentials to circumvent MDR in ovarian cancer.

        "text": "In this paper, we present a strategy to improve delivery of femtosecond laser pulses from a regenerative amplifier through a hollow core photonic crystal fiber for temporally focused wide-field two-photon endomicroscopy. For endomicroscope application, wide-field two-photon excitation has the advantage of requiring no scanning in the distal end. However, wide-field two-photon excitation requires peak power that is 104\u2013105 times higher than the point scanning approach corresponding to femtosecond pulses with energy on the order of 1\u201310 μJ at the specimen plane. The transmission of these high energy pulses through a single mode fiber into the microendoscope is a significant challenge. Two approaches were pursued to partially overcome this limitation. First, a single high energy pulse is split into a train of pulses with energy below the fiber damage threshold better utilizing the available laser energy. Second, stretching the pulse width in time by introducing negative dispersion was shown to have the dual benefit of reducing fiber damage probability and compensating for the positive group velocity dispersion induced by the fiber. With these strategy applied, 11 fold increase in the two photon excitation signal has been demonstrated.

        "text": "Creating, imaging, and transforming the topological charge1, 2 in a superconductor3, a superfluid4, 5, a system of cold atoms6, or a soft ferromagnet7, 8, 9 is a difficult\u2014if not impossible\u2014task because of the shortness of the length scales and lack of control. The length scale and softness of defects in liquid crystals allow the easy observation of charges, but it is difficult to control charge creation. Here we demonstrate full control over the creation, manipulation and analysis of topological charges that are pinned to a microfibre in a nematic liquid crystal. Oppositely charged pairs are created through the Kibble\u2013Zurek mechanism10, 11 by applying a laser-induced local temperature quench in the presence of symmetry-breaking boundaries. The pairs are long-lived, oppositely charged rings or points that either attract and annihilate, or form a long-lived, charge-neutral loop made of two segments with a fractional topological charge. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Creation and annihilation of topological charges on a fibre. a, The NLC is heated into the isotropic phase by the strong light of the laser tweezers, thus creating an isotropic island (Iso). At t = 0 the light is switched off and the NLC is quenched into the nematic phase (N). The dense tangle of defects annihilates in less than a second. b, The NLC is quenched from the isotropic island surrounding a fibre. A pair of defects is created, each carrying an opposite topological charge. c, If let free, the pair annihilates into the vacuum. d, LdG simulation of the Saturn ring and the Saturn anti-ring with opposite charges and windings. e, The sign of the charge is tested using the repulsive force between like topological charges. f, An arbitrary number of ring\u2013anti-ring pairs can be created on a fibre. Images a\u2013c,f were taken between crossed polarizers and the red plate, which shows the average molecular orientation in different colours. Figure 2: Dynamics of charge annihilation on a fibre. a, A pair consisting of a Saturn ring and an anti-ring is annihilated on a fibre. The length of the fibre is ∼400 μm, the diameter is 8 μm and the cell thickness is 65 μm. b, The positions of the + (red) and − (blue) Saturn rings as a function of time during pair annihilation. The inset shows the relative velocity of the two rings. The open symbols are data from the experiment; the closed symbols (black) are data from the numerical simulation. The red line is a linear fit to the blue data points. c, Numerical simulation of the ring and anti-ring attraction, showing the director (yellow, vertical plane) and velocity fields (red, horizontal plane). Figure 3: Point charges and charge-neutral loops on a fibre. a, After inserting a glass fibre into a thick layer of the NLC, a gigantic Saturn ring with a −1 charge is created (i). The true image is on the left; the LdG simulation is on the right. This ring is cut by the tweezers (ii), creating a narrow region of a topological soliton in between the two loops with opposite winding numbers (iii). The LdG simulation is shown in (iv). b, The second cut with the laser tweezers creates a second soliton on the right, isolating a closed loop in between. This loop shrinks into the −1 monopole (iii). The LdG analysis demonstrates the −1 monopole (hyperbolic hedgehog), with two closed loops on each side, with the winding numbers +1/2 (iv). c, The topological charge of the −1 point defect is tested with an elastic dipole. The +1 part of the dipole is attracted towards the monopole on the fibre, identifying it as the −1 charge. d, A sequence of alternating charges is created on a fibre, attracting a series of dipolar colloidal particles. e, A topological soliton is seen as a dark-shaded region below the fibre, and the LdG simulation is shown on the right (i). A microquench produces a long-lived charge-neutral loop, surrounded by two solitons (iii). The LdG numerical simulation of a charge-neutral loop on a fibre is shown in (iv). f, The charge of the charge-neutral loop is tested by the +1 end of the dipolar particle. This + end is repelled from the left section of the loop towards the right section, demonstrating oppositely charged sections. Figure 4: Topological rules on a fibre. a, A charge-neutral loop has a −1/2 winding number on one side and a +1/2 on the other, with two transitions through the twist profile. The colours indicate different local structures of the loop. The yellow and blue isosurfaces indicate locations with a high bend and splay, whereas green highlights the twist deformation29. Loops of this type are freely created and annihilated, as they do not contribute to the topological charge. b, The fibre cross-section has three possible states: two states with an escaped disclination line of the winding number −1, with opposite escape directions, and the symmetric states with two −1/2 disclinations on the top and bottom. c, The fibre can have any succession of the cross-sections from b. The transitions between cross-sections carry the topological charge, which can be assigned to entire point defects and loops, as well as to loop endings. The charge is closed in a box (two examples are shown), and the Gauss law measures the topological charge\u2014that is, the number of escaped lines exiting the box. The direction of the topological flux depends on the direction of the escape and is shown by arrows. The topological charges are marked.

The same strain reduces the coercive field by 2\u20134 Oe, and increases the domain wall velocity measured by wide-field Kerr microscopy by 30-100%, with larger changes observed for thicker Co layers.

        "text": "Ferroelectric random access memory is still challenging in the feature of combination of room temperature stability, non-destructive readout and high intensity storage. As a non-contact and non-destructive information readout method, surface potential has never been paid enough attention because of the unavoidable decay of the surface potential contrast between oppositely polarized domains. That is mainly due to the recombination of the surface movable charges around the domain walls. Here, by introducing a laser beam into the combination of piezoresponse force microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy, we demonstrate that the surface potential contrast of BiFeO3 films can be recovered under light illumination. The recovering mechanism is understood based on the redistribution of the photo-induced charges driven by the internal electric field. Furthermore, we have created a 12-cell memory pattern based on BiFeO3 films to show the feasibility of such photo-assisted non-volatile and non-destructive readout of the ferroelectric memory.

        "text": "We present a highly efficient omnidirectional color filter that takes advantage of an Ag-TiO2-Ag nano-resonator integrated with a phase-compensating TiO2 overlay. The dielectric overlay substantially improves the angular sensitivity by appropriately compensating for the phase pertaining to the structure and suppresses unwanted optical reflection so as to elevate the transmission efficiency. The filter is thoroughly designed, and it is analyzed in terms of its reflection, optical admittance, and phase shift, thereby highlighting the origin of the omnidirectional resonance leading to angle-invariant characteristics. The polarization dependence of the filter is explored, specifically with respect to the incident angle, by performing experiments as well as by providing the relevant theoretical explanation. We could succeed in demonstrating the omnidirectional resonance for the incident angles ranging to up to 70°, over which the center wavelength is shifted by below 3.5% and the peak transmission efficiency is slightly degraded from 69%. The proposed filters incorporate a simple multi-layered structure and are expected to be utilized as tri-color pixels for applications that include image sensors and display devices. These devices are expected to allow good scalability, not requiring complex lithographic processes.

Combined analysis using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis confirms the change of the chemical formula from oxidized Sr0.95Ti0.9Nb0.1O3.00 to reduced Sr0.95Ti0.9Nb0.1O2.90 for the bare sample. By contrast, a significant concentration of oxygen vacancy is additionally formed in situ for Mn- or Cr-doped samples by reducing the oxidized Sr0.95Ti0.8Nb0.1M0.1O3.00 (M = Mn, Cr) to Sr0.95Ti0.8Nb0.1M0.1O2.85. The ionic conductivities of the Mn- and Cr-doped titanate improve by approximately 2 times higher than bare titanate in an oxidizing atmosphere and 3\u20136 times higher in a reducing atmosphere at intermediate temperatures. A remarkable chemical accommodation of CO2 molecules is achieved on the surface of the reduced and doped titanate, and the chemical desorption temperature reaches a common carbonate decomposition temperature. The electrical properties of the cathode materials are investigated and correlated with the electrochemical performance of the composite electrodes. Direct CO2 electrolysis at composite cathodes is investigated in solid-oxide electrolyzers. The electrode polarizations and current efficiencies are observed to be significantly improved with the Mn- or Cr-doped titanate cathodes.

        "text": "CoSb3-based skutterudites are promising intermediate-temperature thermoelectric materials and fundamental understanding of the thermal transport in CoSb3 is crucial for further improving its performance. We herein calculate the lattice thermal conductivity κL of CoSb3 with first-principles methods and conduct a comprehensive analysis on phonon mode contribution, relaxation time and mean free path (MFP) distributions. The contribution of optical phonons is found to be significant (28% at 300 K) and important optical modes usually involve two or more pnicogen atoms moving synchronously. The MFP (~135 nm at 300 K) corresponding to 50% κL accumulation in CoSb3 is much larger than that predicted from the kinetic theory (~4 nm), providing an opportunity to reduce κL by nanoengineering. The effects of elemental substitution and nanoengineering on κL are therefore investigated. A 10% substitution of Sb by As results in 57% reduction of κL while the in-plane (cross-plane) κL of a 50-nm CoSb3 thin film is only 56% (33%) of the bulk κL at 300 K. The impurity scattering and boundary scattering mainly suppress phonons in different frequency regimes. By combining these two effects, κL can be reduced by more than 70% at 300 K, potentially leading to much improved ZT near room temperature.

        "text": "Many efforts have been devoted to the design and achievement of negative-refractive-index metamaterials since the 2000s1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. One of the challenges at present is to extend that field beyond electromagnetism by realizing three-dimensional (3D) media with negative acoustic indices9. We report a new class of locally resonant ultrasonic metafluids consisting of a concentrated suspension of macroporous microbeads engineered using soft-matter techniques. The propagation of Gaussian pulses within these random distributions of \u2018ultra-slow\u2019 Mie resonators is investigated through in situ ultrasonic experiments. The real part of the acoustic index is shown to be negative (up to almost − 1) over broad frequency bandwidths, depending on the volume fraction of the microbeads as predicted by multiple-scattering calculations. These soft 3D acoustic metamaterials open the way for key applications such as sub-wavelength imaging and transformation acoustics, which require the production of acoustic devices with negative or zero-valued indices.

        "text": "Skyrmions are topologically protected winding vector fields characterized by a spherical topology1. Magnetic skyrmions can arise as the result of the interplay of various interactions, including exchange, dipolar and anisotropy energy in the case of magnetic bubbles2, 3, 4 and an additional Dzyaloshinskii\u2013Moriya interaction in the case of chiral skyrmions5. Whereas the static and low-frequency dynamics of skyrmions are already well under control6, 7, 8, 9, their gigahertz dynamical behaviour2 has not been directly observed in real space. Here, we image the gigahertz gyrotropic eigenmode dynamics of a single magnetic bubble and use its trajectory to experimentally confirm its skyrmion topology. The particular trajectory points to the presence of strong inertia, with a mass much larger than predicted by existing theories. This mass is endowed by the topological confinement of the skyrmion and the energy associated with its size change. It is thereby expected to be found in all skyrmionic structures in magnetic systems and beyond. Our experiments demonstrate that the mass term plays a key role in describing skyrmion dynamics. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Illustration of the topology of skyrmionic spin structures with a disk-shaped domain space. a, A sphere S2 with its identity map vector field into which all skyrmions can be continuously deformed. It is also the most general representation of the spin space (because spin is a vector in with constant modulus). The hue of the colour represents the azimuthal angle ϕ, and the black and white colour represents the polar angle θ of the spherical coordinates. b, A magnetic bubble, which covers the sphere exactly once (N = 1). The poles are mapped to extended areas (the inner and outer domains). Hence, all spins at the boundary of the domain space point in the same direction, which confines the inner domain and the domain wall. This is the structure investigated in the present work. c, A chiral skyrmion, which has a different radial distribution from that of the bubble5. Topologically, however, both are the same, as the bubble can be obtained from the chiral skyrmion by expanding its inner domain. d, A hedgehog skyrmion, which is again topologically equivalent to the other figures. The hedgehog skyrmion can be continuously deformed to the chiral skyrmion by rotating all spins by 90° around an axis normal to the plane. Figure 2: Excitation of a multi-bubble state by an external magnetic field pulse. a, Schematic cross-section of the sample, showing the pump and the imaging elements on the Si3N4 membrane (light green), which is supported by a Si frame (grey). The 550 nm diameter magnetic disk (in the centre) is surrounded by a Au microcoil (bright yellow). The back side of the membrane is covered by a Au mask (dark yellow) with three holes, one with 800 nm diameter behind the magnetic CoB/Pt disk and two reference holes at a few μm distance. b, Temporal evolution of the injected current generating the magnetic field pulse. The colour of this plot represents the time delay, and is used consistently throughout this paper. c, Magnetic domain configuration of the disk at different time delays, as indicated by the coloured point in each image. In the black areas the magnetization is antiparallel to the static field (that is, the magnetization is pointing towards the reader), whereas in the white areas it is parallel. d, Displacement (Δx, Δy) of the centre of magnetization of the bubble indicated by an arrow in c, with the time encoded by the colour of the points. Large diameter dots correspond to the images shown in c. The line connecting the points is a guide to the eye, visualizing the temporal sequence of the measured data. It does not represent the motion of the bubble. The error bars represent one standard deviation, obtained from the difference of the bubble positions in the two independent reconstructions plus a constant noise level of 1.4 nm (see Supplementary Information IX for details). The inset shows a finite difference calculation of the current density in the microcoil and the corresponding z-component of the generated magnetic field inside the coil for a current of 52 mA. Figure 3: Analytic description of the gyrotropic motion of the bubble. a,b, Displacements Δx and Δy of the x and y coordinate of the centre of magnetization of the bubble versus time. c, Trajectory of the bubble. Coloured lines in a\u2013c represent a fit of the analytical model to the experimentally observed bubble gyration (points). The colour encodes the time after the start of the bipolar pulse (see Fig. 2b). Large-diameter dots correspond to the images shown in Fig. 2c. The grey lines in a,b show the best fit with a single-frequency model to the data after t = 8 ns, which is not able to describe the data. Error bars represent standard deviation, see Fig. 2d.

        "text": "Can the topology of a network that consists of many particles interacting with each other change in complexity when a phase transition occurs? The answer to this question is particularly interesting to understand the nature of the phase transitions if the distinct phases do not break any symmetry, such as topological phase transitions. Here we present a novel theoretical framework established by complex network analysis for demonstrating that across a transition point of the topological superconductors, the network space experiences a homogeneous-heterogeneous transition invisible in real space. This transition is nothing but related to the robustness of a network to random failures. We suggest that the idea of the network robustness can be applied to characterizing various phase transitions whether or not the symmetry is broken.

        "text": "The interplay between spin, charge and orbital degrees of freedom has led to the development of spintronic devices such as spin\u2013torque oscillators and spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memories. In this development, spin pumping represents a convenient way to electrically detect magnetization dynamics1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The effect originates from direct conversion of low-energy quantized spin waves in the magnet, known as magnons, into a flow of spins from the precessing magnet to adjacent leads. In this case, a secondary spin\u2013charge conversion element, such as heavy metals with large spin Hall angle4, 5, 6 or multilayer layouts7, is required to convert the spin current into a charge signal. Here, we report the experimental observation of charge pumping in which a precessing ferromagnet pumps a charge current, demonstrating direct conversion of magnons into high-frequency currents via the relativistic spin\u2013orbit interaction. The generated electric current, unlike spin currents generated by spin-pumping, can be directly detected without the need of any additional spin\u2013charge conversion mechanism. The charge-pumping phenomenon is generic and gives a deeper understanding of its reciprocal effect, the spin orbit torque, which is currently attracting interest for their potential in manipulating magnetic information. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Spin\u2013orbit torque and charge pumping. a, A charge current through (Ga,Mn)As results in a non-equilibrium spin polarization of the carriers, which exchange-couples to the magnetization and exerts a torque. The effect is induced by spin\u2013orbit coupling, which mediates the transfer of orbital momentum to spin angular momentum. An alternating current generates a time-varying torque, which drives magnetic precession resonantly when a magnetic field is applied. b, The reciprocal effect of a. Magnetization precession leads to a non-equilibrium spin concentration, which pumps charge (green arrows) and is converted into an alternating charge current by the spin\u2013orbit coupling. c, Polar plot illustrating the direction of the effective magnetic field induced by a charge current along different crystal directions. The Rashba (hR) and Dresselhaus (hD) spin\u2013orbit coupling contributions are indicated by red and blue arrows, respectively. d, Polar plot illustrating the direction of the charge current pumped by magnetization precession around different crystal directions. The Rashba (jR) and Dresselhaus (jD) contributions are indicated by red and blue arrows, respectively. Figure 2: Charge-pumping experiment. a, Schematics of the measuring set-up. A 7 GHz microwave signal (red arrow) is launched towards a (Ga,Mn)As bar via an impedance-matching circuit. The microwave current passed through the bar excites magnetization precession via SOT when an in-plane magnetic field B is swept through the resonance. The orientation of the field is defined with respect to the bar direction, as shown on the Cartesian plot. The microwave voltage generated in (Ga,Mn)As by magnonic charge pumping (blue arrow) is transmitted through the same impedance matcher to the microwave circuitry, where the amplitude of the signal is amplified and detected. A low-frequency lock-in field-modulation technique is used, with a 3.3 mT oscillating magnetic field Bmod applied at 45° from the bar direction. A directional coupler separates the incoming signal used to excite magnetic precession from the outgoing signal generated both by magnonic charge pumping and the microwave signal reflected from the circuit. The impedance-matching circuit also includes a bias tee that allows the rectified voltage along the bar to be measured. b, Derivative of the rectified voltage along the a [100]-oriented bar, (dVdc/dB)Bmod, measured by a field-modulation lock-in technique as the magnetic field is swept along different in-plane directions. c, Derivative of the microwave voltage along a [100]-oriented bar, (dVω/dB)Bmod, induced by magnonic charge pumping for the same field directions as in b. d, Amplitude of microwave voltage Vω as a function of precessional amplitude A. The value of A (in mrad) is obtained from the amplitude of the rectified voltage |Vdc| = |I|RAMRA/2, where I is the microwave current passing through the bar and RAMR is the anisotropic magneto-resistance coefficient.

Symmetric and antisymmetric components of the integrated resonances shown in Fig. 2c for different directions of external field B. a,b, Results obtained for a bar oriented along the [100] crystal direction (a) and for a bar oriented along the [010] direction (b). Data are compared to the theoretical band calculated without any fitting parameters from the values of the SO field components, by including the error (symmetric and antisymmetric contributions are equal and are shown by a unique band).

One particularly exciting application is the realization of topological superconductivity1 as a basis for quantum information processing2, 3. Proposals in this direction based on the proximity effect in semiconductor nanowires are appealing because the key ingredients are currently in hand4, 5. However, previous instances of proximitized semiconductors show significant tunnelling conductance below the superconducting gap, suggesting a continuum of subgap states\u2014a situation that nullifies topological protection6, 7. Here, we report a hard superconducting gap induced by the proximity effect in a semiconductor, using epitaxial InAs\u2013Al semiconductor\u2013superconductor nanowires.

We found that a chemical imbalance exists at the misfit dislocation which leads to dramatic changes in the point defect content at the interface \u2013 stabilizing the structure requires removing as much as 50% of the metal atoms and insertion of a large number of oxygen interstitials. The exact defect composition that stabilizes the interface is sensitive to the external oxygen partial pressure. We relate the preferred defect structure at the interface to a competition between chemical and strain energies as defects are introduced.

The misfit dislocation is indicated by the dotted lines while the shaded rectangular box indicates the interfacial Fe layer. (b) Vacancy formation energy at Fe sites within the interfacial Fe layer. The red box indicates the dislocation region. It is observed that the vacancy formation energy at certain sites is negative, i.e. a vacancy will form spontaneously at those interfacial iron sites at T = 0 K. (c) Plot of vacancy formation energy vs. excess Bader charge (in terms of electrons) of iron atoms (compared to bulk iron) at the interface within the ideal structure with no point defects. Full size image View in article Figure 3: (a) Change in energy of the system with the introduction of defects: (a) vacancies; (b) interstitial oxygen; (c, d) mixture of vacancies with twelve and seventeen interstitial oxygen for (c) and (d), respectively. At any stage, the vacancy concentration at the interface was calculated as the ratio of the total number of iron vacancies introduced at the interface with respect to the total number of iron sites present at the interface within the ideal structure. In Fig. 3a the Fe/O ratio was calculated from the number of iron left at the interface at any stage divided by the number of oxygen atoms within the interfacial yttria layer. For the calculation of the Fe/O ratio in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3d both interstitial oxygen and oxygen atoms within the interfacial yttria layer were considered. The capital letters indicate various structures used for subsequent calculations. M is the ideal structure with no defects (vacancy or interstitials) while N and Q are the structures with twelve and seventeen interstitial oxygen (with no vacancies), respectively. In Fig. 3(b) the indicated oxygen chemical potentials are computed for T = 900K. The insets are zoomed-in regions of the curves indicated by the dashed-line boxes. In the insets, points A, B and C represent the vacancy concentration corresponding to the minimum energy structures for the zero, twelve and seventeen-oxygen structures. For the minimum energy structures (A, B and C) all iron vacancy formation energies are positive, and any additional iron vacancies increase the energy of the system. In all cases, the associated change in the atomic structure lowers the Fe/O ratio at the interface, restoring the chemical imbalance.

These represent the structures before (M, N, Q) and after (A, B, C) minimizing the energy versus vacancy content for different oxygen content. The blue box represents the dislocation region. (g) Spatial variation of local Fe/O ratio at the interface at and away from the misfit dislocation for four different structures, namely the ideal structure (M), the structure with seventeen oxygen (Q) and the structures corresponding to the minimum energy structures A and C in Fig. 3, which are structure M and Q after minimizing the energy versus vacancy content. The local Fe/O ratio was measured based on the number of Fe and O atoms within five rectangular regions in the y-direction. The width of each rectangular region is equal to the cell size in the y-direction divided by the number of columns of iron (i.e. five).

(b) Calculated vacancy formation energy before and after an oxygen atom is introduced at an interstitial position within the interface of the ideal structure to quantitatively analyze the energetic contributions of oxygen interstitials to the Fe vacancy formation energies at different locations within the interface plane. We also found that the introduction of more than one oxygen atom (not shown) in the neighborhood of any iron atom destabilizes that iron atom, implying that the strain energy dominates when multiple interstitial oxygen atoms reside in the neighborhood of an iron atom.

        "text": "The optical response of semiconducting monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is dominated by strongly bound excitons that are stable even at room temperature. However, substrate-related effects such as screening and disorder in currently available specimens mask many anticipated physical phenomena and limit device applications of TMDCs. Here, we demonstrate that that these undesirable effects are strongly suppressed in suspended devices. Extremely robust (photogain > 1,000) and fast (response time < 1 ms) photoresponse allow us to study, for the first time, the formation, binding energies, and dissociation mechanisms of excitons in TMDCs through photocurrent spectroscopy. By analyzing the spectral positions of peaks in the photocurrent and by comparing them with first-principles calculations, we obtain binding energies, band gaps and spin-orbit splitting in monolayer TMDCs. For monolayer MoS2, in particular, we obtain an extremely large binding energy for band-edge excitons, Ebind ≥ 570 meV. Along with band-edge excitons, we observe excitons associated with a van Hove singularity of rather unique nature. The analysis of the source-drain voltage dependence of photocurrent spectra reveals exciton dissociation and photoconversion mechanisms in TMDCs.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information First-order phase transitions are accompanied by a latent heat. Consequently, manipulating them by means of an external field causes a caloric effect. Although transitions from antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic states are not controlled by a magnetic field, a large barocaloric effect is expected when strong cross-correlations between the volume and magnetic order occur. Here we examine how geometric frustration in itinerant antiferromagnetic compounds can enhance the barocaloric effect. We study the thermodynamic behaviour of the frustrated antiferromagnet Mn3GaN, and report an entropy change of 22.3 J kg−1 K−1 that is concomitant with a hydrostatic pressure change of 139 MPa. Furthermore, the calculated value of the adiabatic temperature change reaches 5 K by depressurization of 93 MPa. The giant barocaloric effect in Mn3GaN is caused by a frustration-driven enhancement of the ratio of volume change against the pressure coefficient of the Néel temperature. This mechanism for enhancing the barocaloric effect can form the basis for a new class of materials for solid-state refrigerants. At a glance Figures Figure 1: DTA curve as a function of temperature in Mn3GaN. Variation of δT at selected values of hydrostatic pressure during the cooling run. The curves have been corrected for the baseline drift. The inset shows the peak temperature of the curves as a function of the pressure. (The straight line corresponds to a linear fit to the data.)

The large Mn moment is stabilized by the lattice expansion because the magnetic energy gain is larger than the electronic kinetic energy loss. b, The small DLM (green arrow) and small lattice in the fluctuating PM disordered state. Because fluctuation prohibits magnetic energy gain due to the short-range order, lowering of the electronic kinetic energy due to an increase of the bandwidth by volume contraction is energetically favourable.

        "text": "Protection of metal nanoparticles from agglomeration is critical for their functions and applications. The conventional method for enhancing their stability is to cover them with passivation layers to prevent direct contact. However, the presence of a protective shell blocks exposure of the metal species to reactants, thereby significantly impeding the nanoparticles' utility as catalysts. Here, we report that metal nanoparticles can be prepared and used in a surface-exposed state that renders them inherently catalytically active. This strategy is realised by spatial confinement and electronic stabilisation with a dual-module mesoporous and microporous three-dimensional π-network in which surface-exposed nanoparticles are crystallised upon in situ reduction. The uncovered palladium nanoparticles serve as heterogeneous catalysts that are exceptionally active in water, catalyse unreactive aryl chlorides for straightforward carbon\u2013carbon bond formation and are stable for repeated use in various types of cross couplings. Therefore, our results open new perspectives in developing practical heterogeneous catalysts.

        "text": "The spin-fluctuation mechanism of superconductivity usually results in the presence of gapless or nodal quasiparticle states in the excitation spectrum. Nodal quasiparticle states are well established in copper-oxide, and heavy-fermion superconductors, but not in iron-based superconductors. Here, we study the pairing symmetry and mechanism of a new class of plutonium-based high-Tc superconductors and predict the presence of a nodal s+− wave pairing symmetry in this family. Starting from a density-functional theory (DFT) based electronic structure calculation we predict several three-dimensional (3D) Fermi surfaces in this 115 superconductor family. We identify the dominant Fermi surface \u201chot-spots\u201d in the inter-band scattering channel, which are aligned along the wavevector Q = (π, π, π), where degeneracy could induce sign-reversal of the pairing symmetry. Our calculation demonstrates that the s+− wave pairing strength is stronger than the previously thought d-wave pairing; and more importantly, this pairing state allows for the existence of nodal quasiparticles. Finally, we predict the shape of the momentum- and energy-dependent magnetic resonance spectrum for the identification of this pairing symmetry.

Despite the importance of these zinc-efflux events little is known about their origin. To understand the molecular mechanism of the zinc spark we combined four physical approaches that resolve zinc distributions in single cells: a chemical probe for dynamic live-cell fluorescence imaging and a combination of scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence microscopy and three-dimensional elemental tomography for high-resolution elemental mapping. We show that the zinc spark arises from a system of thousands of zinc-loaded vesicles, each of which contains, on average, 106 zinc atoms. These vesicles undergo dynamic movement during oocyte maturation and exocytosis at the time of fertilization. The discovery of these vesicles and the demonstration that zinc sparks originate from them provides a quantitative framework for understanding how zinc fluxes regulate cellular processes. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Vital zinc probe reveals cortical compartments in the female gamete in mouse. a, Final step (see Methods) in the synthesis of \u200bZincBY-1, a novel fluorescent zinc probe. b, Fluorescence emission of \u200bZincBY-1 in \u200bEGTA-buffered Zn2+ solutions. Error bars represent ± s.e.m. Spectra were acquired in 100 mM \u200bKNO3, 50 mM \u200bHEPES, pH 7.2, λex = 520 nm. Integrated emission (530\u2013700 nm) was plotted versus calculated [Zn2+free] and fitted to the apparent Kd = 2.5 nM. c, GV oocyte, MII egg and parthenote incubated with 50 nM \u200bZincBY-1 (green) and DNA probe \u200bHoechst 33342 (blue). Representative z-stack projection (i, iv and vii), confocal optical slice (ii, v and viii) and brightfield (iii, vi and ix) images are shown. Bright, punctate cortical fluorescence from \u200bZincBY-1 is observed in GV and MII cells. d, Incubation with 10 µM \u200bTPEN for ten minutes abolished the cortical fluorescence in \u200bZincBY-1 stained cells. e, Distance of \u200bZincBY-1 compartments from the PM in GV (black) and MII (grey) cells. Vesicle positions were sorted into 1 µm bins and plotted as a histogram; >90% of compartments were within 5 µm of the membrane in both cell types. Scale bars in c and d, 20 µm. Figure 2: Labile zinc is cortically localized in the oocyte and tracks with CG staining. a, Schematic of meiotic maturation. GV oocytes in the ovary are arrested at prophase I (PI) of meiosis. Upon hormonal signalling, maturation begins and the cell progresses through meiosis until it arrests at MII, at which point the egg is competent for fertilization. Intervening stages during maturation include germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), metaphase I (MI) and telophase I/anaphase I (TI/AI). b (i\u2013v) Samples at GV (i), GVBD (ii), MI (iii), AI (iv) and MII (v) were labelled with the zinc-specific probe \u200bZincBY-1 (50 nM, green) to track labile zinc, and counterstained with \u200bHoechst 33342 to label DNA (blue). vi\u2013x, Following zinc imaging, cells were fixed and stained for CGs using fluorescently labelled Lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA, red) and counterstained for DNA with \u200bDAPI (blue). Staining patterns for zinc and LCA are similar at each stage of maturation, which suggests that zinc-enriched structures may represent the same vesicles as, or comprise a subpopulation of, the CGs. Representative optical confocal sections for each meiotic stage are shown. At least five oocytes were visualized at each stage in three independent experiments. Scale bars, 25 µm. *Adjacent oocyte.

The z-stack position is indicated in each panel. c, Angular analysis of intracellular and extracellular fluorescence distribution in a z-section (z14 is shown, and the others are given in the Supplementary Information). The fluorescence intensity pattern is the same in both channels, which indicates that zinc-enriched vesicles are the source of the zinc spark. d,e, Egg imaged in a 1 µm confocal section. d, Images from a time course taken before (i), during (ii) and after (iii) a zinc spark. The brightfield image indicates intracellular and extracellular ROIs. e, Time traces show a simultaneous decrease in intracellular fluorescence and increase in extracellular fluorescence, which indicates that zinc-enriched vesicles are the source of the zinc spark. Figure 6: The zinc flux during egg activation is regulated by a quantitative loss of cortical zinc compartments. This schematic diagram summarizes the fluxes in total zinc that are observed during maturation and immediately following fertilization/egg activation. The meiotic cycle in the mammalian egg occurs over a very short period of time and is accompanied by a very large flux in the amount and localization of the inorganic element zinc (black bars)5, 6. Through the combined used of our novel zinc probe, \u200bZincBY-1, for live-cell imaging and a suite of fixed-cell imaging technologies (sulfide\u2013zinc fixation, STEM-EDS, Bionanoprobe XFM, XFM tomography), we have estimated that there are 8,000 zinc-enriched cortical vesicles in the egg, each containing ~1 million zinc atoms. These vesicles, containing in total eight billion zinc atoms, are lost at fertilization during the zinc spark and quantitatively contribute to the zinc efflux that is required during the egg-to-embryo transition. This study sets a precedent for how zinc can be quantitatively tracked during key biological processes.

        "text": "We report on the demonstration of a new type of axial nanowire LED heterostructures, with the use of self-organized InGaN/AlGaN dot-in-a-wire core-shell nanowire arrays. The large bandgap AlGaN shell is spontaneously formed on the sidewall of the nanowire during the growth of AlGaN barrier of the quantum dot active region. As such, nonradiative surface recombination, that dominates the carrier dynamics of conventional axial nanowire LED structures, can be largely eliminated, leading to significantly increased carrier lifetime from ~0.3 ns to 4.5 ns. The luminescence emission is also enhanced by orders of magnitude. Moreover, the p-doped AlGaN barrier layers can function as distributed electron blocking layers (EBLs), which is found to be more effective in reducing electron overflow, compared to the conventional AlGaN EBL. The device displays strong white-light emission, with a color rendering index of ~95. An output power of >5 mW is measured for a 1 mm × 1 mm device, which is more than 500 times stronger than the conventional InGaN axial nanowire LEDs without AlGaN distributed EBLs.

        "text": "Reliable chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is currently a highly pressing research field, as numerous potential applications rely on the production of high quality films on a macroscopic scale. Here, we show the use of liquid phase exfoliated nanosheets and patterned sputter deposited layers as solid precursors for chemical vapour deposition. TMD monolayers were realized using a close proximity precursor supply in a CVD microreactor setup. A model describing the growth mechanism, which is capable of producing TMD monolayers on arbitrary substrates, is presented. Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and electrical transport measurements reveal the high quality of the TMD samples produced. Furthermore, through patterning of the precursor supply, we achieve patterned growth of monolayer TMDs in defined locations, which could be adapted for the facile production of electronic device components.

Here we introduce a two-photon microscope possessing two articulated arms that can simultaneously image two brain areas (~0.38 mm2 each), either nearby or distal, using microendoscopes. Concurrent Ca2+ imaging of ~100\u2013300 neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) and lateromedial (LM) visual area in behaving mice revealed that the variability in LM neurons' visual responses was strongly dependent on that in V1, suggesting that fluctuations in sensory responses propagate through extended cortical networks. At a glance Figures Figure 1: A two-photon microscope with microendoscopes and two optical axes for imaging two brain areas in awake behaving mice. (a) Schematic of the optical pathway. The beam from an infrared ultrashort-pulsed Ti:sapphire laser is divided into two beams using polarizing beam splitters (PBSC). Rotatable half-wave (λ/2) plates control the power of each beam independently; a beam block (BB) absorbs the unused power. Two pairs of scanning mirrors independently sweep each beam across the two individual specimen planes. Each arm of the microscope has three remotely controlled motorized stages providing three translational degrees of mechanical freedom. Each arm also has two rotational degrees of freedom that are adjusted manually. To allow the two chosen brain areas under view to be either distal or nearby, two microscope objective lenses focus the two beams into a pair of microendoscopes (0.5 NA), which in turn focus the laser beam onto tissue. Visible fluorescence emissions return through the microendoscopes and objective lenses and reflect off dichroic mirrors. Photomultiplier tubes (PMT) detect the fluorescence signals. Inset, the two microendoscopes focus the two beams onto the chosen brain areas and collect fluorescence signals. One microendoscope has a holder that bears a miniature mirror folding its incoming beam by 90°; this arrangement allows the objectives to be placed close to each other without collision.

Supplementary Fig. 3: Computational studies show that an axial resolution of 10 μm leads to minuscule crosstalk from out-of-focal plane cell bodies in neurons\u2019 digitized records of Ca2+ dynamics. (a) Using pairs of actual two-photon fluorescence traces of Ca2+ activity (traces in top two rows), we calculated levels of cross talk between pairs of layer 2/3 mouse visual cortical neurons hypothetically positioned at different axial separations. Both cells in each pair had identical lateral coordinates. An example cell pair and traces for three example axial separations (12 μm, 14 μm and 20 μm) between the two cells\u2019 centroids are shown (traces in bottom three rows). However, overall we calculated cross talk levels for a total of 132 cell pairs, whose axial separations were varied over a range of hypothetical distance values. From actual two-photon image stacks, we determined that mouse visual cortical neurons have cell body diameters of 12.09 ±0.05 μm (mean ± s.e.m.; N = 339 layer 2/3 pyramidal cells), in close agreement with prior measurements in this cell type24. We thus modeled each cell as a 12-μm-diameter homogeneous sphere, and used the three-dimensional optical resolution measurements from the poorer-performing arm of the dual-axis microscope to estimate the expected cross talk between pairs of cells at various axial separations. After applying the event detection algorithm25 (red asterisks mark detected Ca2+ transients), very few instances of fluorescence cross talk ever reached the digitized event traces (black vertical arrows), which were the traces used for all computations of neuronal coding properties. (b) Computed percentage of false positive events due to cross talk, as a function of the axial separation between the two cells in a pair. Error bars indicate s.e.m. values, computed over 132 cell pairs per data point. (c) Empirically determined, cumulative distribution of the axial separations between layer 2/3 visual cortical pyramidal cells and their closest neighbors in the axial dimension. By using two-photon microscopy in live mice, we measured the anatomic coordinates of 339 pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of mouse visual cortex. For each neuron, we identified its closest neighbor in the axial dimension that could plausibly be a source of cross talk, given the 1.0 μm lateral resolution of the dual-axis microscope. We identified this closest axial neighbor as the nearest cell whose lateral (x,y) centroid coordinates were d) Using the empirically determined distribution of axial separations between cell pairs (panel c) and the computed level of cross talk as function of axial separation (panel b), we computed the statistical distribution of expected cross talk levels across all 339 cells examined. Overall, >97% of neuronal cell bodies had 0% cross talk in the digitized rasters of action potentials detected in the ΔF/F traces, and 98.5% of neurons had % false positive spikes due to cross talk. Supplementary Fig. 4: Experimental assessment of crosstalk from out-of-focal plane neural elements revealed no statistically significant crosstalk in neurons\u2019 digitized records of Ca2+ dynamics. To directly assess cross talk levels from out-of-focal plane neural elements (somata, dendrites or axons) in behaving mice, we acquired Ca2+ activity traces from layer 2/3 visual cortical pyramidal cells at two different optical resolutions simultaneously. To do this, we built a two-photon imaging system in which an electro-optical modulator (EOM) toggled the laser beam between two different optical paths that provided different optical resolutions. (a). Schematic of the optical apparatus. We polarized the beam from an infrared ultrashort-pulsed Ti:Sapphire laser by using a polarizing beam splitter (PBSC). A rotatable half-wave plate (λ/2) provided a means of power control; a beam block (BB) absorbed the unused power. We electronically controlled the EOM such that on every successive image frame (10 Hz frame rate) the beam alternated between the two optical pathways. In pathway 1, the laser beam was magnified so as to provide higher optical resolution (FWHM axial resolution: 4.0 ± 0.1 μm) in the specimen plane. In pathway 2, the beam was de-magnified so as to provide a lower resolution (FWHM axial resolution: 10.4 ± 0.4 μm) that conservatively matched the 9.8 ± 0.2 μm axial resolution of the dual-axis microscope\u2019s poorer-performing arm. The two beam pathways were re-combined within another polarizing beam splitter (PBSC) and co-aligned as they entered the back aperture of a 0.95 NA microscope objective. This arrangement allowed two temporally interleaved time-traces of Ca2+ activity to be acquired from the very same neurons using a single photomultiplier tube (PMT) to detect fluorescence. Inset: Successive image frames acquired in a live mouse using the higher- and lower-resolution beam pathways. (b) Temporally interleaved Ca2+ activity traces acquired at the two different resolutions, from two example cell bodies (top two traces) and two example dendritic processes (bottom two traces). The fluorescence traces acquired at the higher- and lower-resolutions appear almost identical. There is no discernible evidence of any neural sources that are present in the lower-resolution traces but absent in the higher-resolution traces. (c) Statistical comparisons between even-numbered and odd-numbered frames in a Ca2+ imaging video taken exclusively at the higher resolution (i.e. with the EOM directing the beam only to pathway 1) yielded baseline estimates (cyan data) of the statistical uncertainties in the event detection process for both neural cell bodies and dendrites. In this baseline control data, the sets of detected Ca2+ events that we extracted from the even- and odd-numbered image frames differed by 8.6 ± 1.9% (mean ± s.e.m.) of all Ca2+ events occurring in cell bodies (N = 19 cell bodies) and by 12.7 ± 3.0% in dendrites (N = 23 dendrites). When we toggled successive image frames between the higher-resolution and lower-resolution beam pathways, the percentage differences between the sets of detected Ca2+ events in the two data streams (red data) were 6.1 ± 1.7% for cells bodies and 15.7 ± 4.3% for dendrites (N = 20 cell bodies and N = 14 dendrites). These percentages of discrepant events between the higher- and lower-resolution data streams were statistically indistinguishable from those when comparing even- and odd-numbered frames of the baseline datasets acquired using only the higher resolution pathway (Wilcoxon rank-sum test; somas: P = 0.21; dendrites: P = 0.46; N = 20 cell bodies and N = 14 dendrites). Given that the neurons\u2019 measured cell body diameter was 12.09 ± 0.05 μm (mean ± s.e.m; N = 339 layer 2/3 pyramidal cells), it is extremely unlikely that any further improvements in axial resolution to values finer than 4 μm would significantly change these assessments of cross talk. Supplementary Fig. 5: Many dendritic processes yielded their own distinct activity patterns as recorded using the dual-axis microscope in awake behaving mice. (a) Grayscale images are time-averages over 5 min of movie data, acquired by simultaneous Ca2+-imaging of visual areas V1 and LM in a head-restrained mouse at liberty to walk or run on a trackball. (b) Neuronal cell processes that displayed Ca2+ activity, as extracted computationally by an established approach to sorting cellular Ca2+ signals15, are depicted in color. Dendrites marked with numbers have their corresponding time traces shown in panel c. (c) 20 example traces of Ca2+ dynamics in neuronal processes, divided equally between V1 and LM. Blue shaded epochs denote periods of mouse locomotion. Numbers on the traces indicate the corresponding numbered dendrites shown in panel b. Scale bars in a are 100 μm and also apply to b. Supplementary Fig. 6: Cell bodies and neuronal processes in both V1 and LM show orientation tuning in their Ca2+ transient responses to moving grating visual stimuli. Gray traces represent the Ca2+ dynamics imaged on single trials in cell bodies (top two rows) and neuronal processes (bottom two rows), for each of four orthogonal directions of grating movement (each denoted with a distinct color shading). Red traces depict mean responses averaged over 10 presentations. Scale bars are 10 μm and 30 μm for images of cell bodies and neuronal processes, respectively.

Finding the fundamental meaning of fragility is the \u2018condicio sine qua\u2019 for reaching the long expected conceptual breakthrough in this domain. This report shows that fragility is determined by the ratio between two fundamental process energies, viz. the activation enthalpy and activation energy. The reasoning, avoiding any underlying physical model, is supported by the experimental evidence ranging from low molecular weight liquids and polymers to plastic crystals and liquid crystals. All these lead to the new general scaling plot for dynamics of arbitrary glass former. The limited adequacy of broadly used so far semi-empirical relationships between fragility and the activation energy is shown. Results presented remain valid for an arbitrary complex system and collective phenomena if their dynamics is described by the general super-Arrhenius relation.

        "text": "Evolutionary dynamical models for cyclic competitions of three species (e.g., rock, paper, and scissors, or RPS) provide a paradigm, at the microscopic level of individual interactions, to address many issues in coexistence and biodiversity. Real ecosystems often involve competitions among more than three species. By extending the RPS game model to five (rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock, or RPSLS) mobile species, we uncover a fundamental type of mesoscopic interactions among subgroups of species. In particular, competitions at the microscopic level lead to the emergence of various local groups in different regions of the space, each involving three species. It is the interactions among the groups that fundamentally determine how many species can coexist. In fact, as the mobility is increased from zero, two transitions can occur: one from a five- to a three-species coexistence state and another from the latter to a uniform, single-species state. We develop a mean-field theory to show that, in order to understand the first transition, group interactions at the mesoscopic scale must be taken into account. Our findings suggest, more broadly, the importance of mesoscopic interactions in coexistence of great many species.

Most experiments, if not all, are hence focused on carpet cloaks because of their relatively low requirements to material properties. Nevertheless, present invisibility carpets are used to hide beneath objects. Here, we report a carpet-like device to directionally conceal objects and further to create illusions above it. The device is fabricated through recording a reflection hologram of objects and is used to produce a time-reversed signal to compensate for the information of the objects and further to create light field of another object so as to realize both functions of hiding the objects and creating illusions, respectively. The carpet-like device can work for macroscopic objects at visible wavelength as the distance between objects and device is at decimeter scale. Our carpet-like device to realizing invisibility and creating illusions may provide a robust way for crucial applications of magic camouflaging and anti-detection etc. Subject terms: Imaging and sensing\u2022 Micro-optics\u2022 Metamaterials\u2022 Transformation optics At a glance Figures View all figures Figure 1: Working models of traditional carpet cloaks and our carpet-like devices. (a) A traditional carpet cloak is used to hide an object beneath. The light reflected by the under surface of the carpet cloak is distorted by the carpet layer so that the curved surface is detected as a plane mirror to the outside. Thus, objects placed in the cavity covered by the curved surface are invisible through reflection observation. (b) and (c), The present carpet-like devices are used to hide objects above them and create an illusion of transferring one object into another one. When illuminated by a light beam, the devices produces a time-reversed signal to compensate for the scattering effect of objects placed above the devices in the case of hiding the objects (b), and to further produce additional light field of another object simultaneously so as to make one object looking as another one by reflection observation (c). Full size image View in article Figure 2: Experimental setup for constructing and characterizing the carpet-like devices. A light beam with wavelength λ = 632.8 nm from a He-Ne laser is divided into three parts: object light W, reference light R and reconstruction light S by beam splitters B1 and B2. M1-M5 are mirrors, E1 and E2 are beam expanders, S1, S2 and S3 are the shuttles, L is a lens with focal length f = 10 cm, P0, P1 and P2 are planes for recording plate, objects O1 and O2, respectively. The distance between object plane P1 and L is 20 cm, which equals to the distance between L and P0. So P0 is the one-to-one image plane of P1. The pinhole is used to block the stray light. A charge-coupled device (CCD) placed 20 cm away behind O1 is used to take images of objects and monitor the characterization of carpet-like devices. A cross mark is placed between the CCD and object plane P1 as a reference mark for monitoring the effect of the carpet-like devices on other objects nearby O1. The x-y plane of coordinate system is parallel to P1 and the z axis direction is anti-parallel to the light beam W. In exposure process, shuttles S1 and S2 are opened but S3 is closed, while in the process of characterizing the effects of finished carpet-like devices, shuttles S1 and S2 are closed but S3 is opened.

        "text": "Could nanostructures act as lenses to focus incident light for efficient utilization of photovoltaics? Is it possible, in order to avoid serious recombination loss, to realize periodic nanostructures in solar cells without direct etching in a light absorbing semiconductor? Here we propose and demonstrate a promising architecture to shape nanolenses on a planar semiconductor. Optically transparent and electrically conductive nanolenses simultaneously provide the optical benefit of modulating the incident light and the electrical advantage of supporting carrier transportation. A transparent indium-tin-oxide (ITO) nanolens was designed to focus the incident light-spectrum in focal lengths overlapping to a strong electric field region for high carrier collection efficiency. The ITO nanolens effectively broadens near-zero reflection and provides high tolerance to the incident light angles. We present a record high light-conversion efficiency of 16.0% for a periodic nanostructured Si solar cell.

        "text": "As a noncentrosymmetric crystal with spin-polarized band structure, MoS2 nanomaterials have attracts increasing attention in many areas such as lithium ion batteries, flexible electronic devices, photoluminescence and valleytronics. The investigation of MoS2 is mainly focused on the electronics and spintronics instead of optics, which restrict its applications as key elements of photonics. In this work, we demonstrate the first observation of the polarization-dependent optical absorption of the MoS2 thin film, which is integrated onto an optical waveguide device. With this feature, a novel optical sensor combining MoS2 thin-film and a microfluidic structure has been constituted to achieve the sensitive monitoring of refractive index.

        "text": "The control of orbitals and spin states of single electrons is a key ingredient for quantum information processing1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and novel detection schemes6, 7, 8 and is, more generally, of great relevance for spintronics9. Coulomb10 and spin blockade11 in double quantum dots12 enable advanced single-spin operations that would be available even for room-temperature applications with sufficiently small devices13. To date, however, spin operations in double quantum dots have typically been observed at sub-kelvin temperatures, a key reason being that it is very challenging to scale a double quantum dot system while retaining independent field-effect control of individual dots. Here, we show that the quantum-confined Stark effect allows two dots only 5 nm apart to be independently addressed without the requirement for aligned nanometre-sized local gating. We thus demonstrate a scalable method to fully control a double quantum dot device, regardless of its physical size. In the present implementation we present InAs/InP nanowire double quantum dots that display an experimentally detectable spin blockade up to 10 K. We also report and discuss an unexpected re-entrant spin blockade lifting as a function of the magnetic field intensity. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Stark effect in a DQD. a, SEM image of one of the investigated nanowire-based transistors. Source (S) and drain (D) electrodes are visible in yellow. A multiple gating technique is used to control quantum states in a one-dimensional InAs/InP heterostructure. b, A multigating approach can be used to control both the filling and the transverse mode energies for electrons in the nanowire. c, Sketch of the device structure, which contains two quantum dots that are subject to the same gating action. d, Despite the gates being two orders of magnitude larger than the inter-dot distance and being expected to induce a quite uniform electrostatic environment on the active region of the device, the Stark effect can easily induce a different energy spectrum evolution in the two quantum dots and provide the equivalent of a detuning parameter in the vicinity of crossings between orbitals. The ideal case depicted corresponds to two radially identical dots, differing only in their axial thicknesses. Figure 2: Tuning spin blockade with the Stark effect. a, The Stark effect is expected to provide the equivalent of level detuning in a standard DQD architecture, but without the need for any local control of the gating action. The level crossing of Fig. 1d will in fact give rise to a honeycomb stability diagram in the presence of charging effects. Pink (blue) lines indicate configurations for which the energy of the spin-degenerate level in the S (D) dot falls inside the bias window, and configurations that allow sequential tunnelling are obtained where such lines cross. Inter-dot capacitive coupling is in this case expected to give rise to two triple points, as indicated by the red circles12. ΔNS/D indicates the effective filling of the DQD at the level crossing, in an excess of electrons occupying filled core orbitals. b, In the presence of large orbital energy gaps, the (1,1) → (2,0) transition can display a strongly nonlinear behaviour because of Pauli spin blockade. Thus, depending on the specific crossing in a, a linear current\u2013voltage response or spin-based rectification can be obtained. c, High-resolution |IDS| maps in the vicinity of a level crossing in one of the studied devices. Bias triangles at VDS = ±5 mV and triple points at low bias (150 µV) demonstrate complete control of DQD operation at T = 1.8 K. The horizontal and vertical sweep parameters correspond approximately to the Stark mode and \u2018filling\u2019 mode, as discussed in the main text. Diagonal lines in the overlay indicate a configuration with an equal value of ΔVSG = VSG2 − VSG1, which is proportional to the lateral field Ex. A closer inspection of the honeycomb structure reveals unusual nonlinearities and an uneven size of the bias triangles. This is not unexpected given the non-standard control mechanism demonstrated here. A clear spin blockade effect is visible in the top left and bottom right bias triangles, demonstrating rectifying behaviour. Figure 3: Finite-bias breakdown of spin blockade. a, Spin-blockade triangles (1,1) → (2,0) for different finite bias VDS = \u20135, \u201310 and \u201315 mV and T = 1.8 K. The edge of the spin-blockaded region (marked by a gold star) is always conductive, because the energy alignment between the right dot and the right lead provides an efficient spin relaxation mechanism. The first non-blocking excited state occurs at an energy of ΔST = 9.1 ± 0.3 meV. It becomes visible for |eVDS| > ΔST and is marked by a purple circle. A further blockade lifting mechanism is also visible at large bias when a further filling configuration (1,2) becomes available within the biasing window of the spin-filtering transition (1,1) → (2,0). This happens when different bias triangles overlap. The red square indicates level configurations allowing a spin relaxation of the right dot spin via a quantum dot\u2013lead resonance (1,1) ↔ (1,2). b, Sketch of the DQD configurations corresponding to the breakdown of spin blockade highlighted in the experimental data in a. c, Spin blockade detection at 10 K and VDS = \u201310 mV; current suppression at the bias triangle base is still clearly evident, even at this relatively high temperature. Figure 4: Re-entrant magnetic lifting of the spin blockade. a, Magnetic field configuration during measurements. b, Bias triangles in spin blockade configuration (1,1) → (2.0) at B = 0, 0.2 and 4 T and VDS = \u201310 mV. A small magnetic field perpendicular to the nanowire is sufficient to lift the spin blockade, consistent with previous results. At larger magnetic fields the overall conduction in the DQD system tends to be suppressed. c, A more subtle evolution is visible when sweeping B between \u20133.6 T and +3.6 T as a function of the detuning (data taken along the dashed white segment crossing the base of the triangle indicated in the middle colourplot of b). The experimental curve is symmetric in B and its average is plotted in the panel: an unexpected oscillatory pattern is observed in the spin relaxation with re-entrant spin blockade marked by arrows and leakage peaks in the 0.2\u20131.2 T range and at B = 2.2 and 3.3 T. A possible explanation entails a coupling modulation caused by a magnetic field flux through the finite-size tunnel barrier separating the two dots.

Here we present a simple, cost-effective, cleanroom-free process to produce large scale soft electronic hardware where standard surface-mounted electrical components were directly bonded onto all-elastomeric printed circuit boards, or soft PCBs. Ag-PDMS tracks were stencil printed onto a PDMS substrate and soft PCBs were made by bonding the top and bottom layers together and filling punched holes with Ag-PDMS to create vias. Silver epoxy was used to bond commercial electrical components and no mechanical failure was observed after hundreds of stretching cycles. We also demonstrate the fabrication of a stretchable clock generator.

        "text": "Geminate recombination of bound polaron pairs at the donor/acceptor interface is one of the major loss mechanisms in organic bulk heterojunction solar cells. One way to overcome Coulomb attraction between opposite charge carriers and to achieve their full dissociation is the introduction of high dielectric permittivity materials such as nanoparticles of narrow band gap semiconductors. We selected CuInS2 nanocrystals of 7.4 nm size, which present intermediate energy levels with respect to poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). Efficient charge transfer from P3HT to nanocrystals takes place as evidenced by light-induced electron spin resonance. Charge transfer between nanocrystals and PCBM only occurs after replacing bulky dodecanethiol (DDT) surface ligands with shorter 1,2-ethylhexanethiol (EHT) ligands. Solar cells containing in the active layer a ternary blend of P3HT:PCBM:CuInS2-EHT nanocrystals in 1:1:0.5 mass ratio show strongly improved short circuit current density and a higher fill factor with respect to the P3HT:PCBM reference device. Complementary measurements of the absorption properties, external quantum efficiency and charge carrier mobility indicate that enhanced charge separation in the ternary blend is at the origin of the observed behavior. The same trend is observed for blends using the glassy polymer poly(triarylamine) (PTAA).

The energetic driving force for the dissociation of the BPP state scales with the LUMO levels offset ΔELUMO. Charge transfer to PCBM can take place both from the polymer and the NCs.

        "text": "We present a de novo model-building approach that combines predicted backbone conformations with side-chain fit to density to accurately assign sequence into density maps. This method yielded accurate models for six of nine experimental maps at 3.3- to 4.8-Å resolution and produced a nearly complete model for an unsolved map containing a 660-residue heterodimeric protein. This method should enable rapid and reliable protein structure determination from near-atomic-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Protocol overview. (a) First, for a nine-residue window centered on each position in the sequence, representative backbone conformations (fragments) are collected and docked into the density map. Second, the resulting fragment placements are then evaluated using a score function consisting of four terms: a density correlation term assessing the agreement of fragment and map; an overlap term favoring fragment pairs assigning the same residue to the same location; a closability term favoring fragment pairs close in sequence that are close in space; and a clash term preventing two residues from occupying the same place. Third, from the candidate placements (green squares), Monte Carlo simulated annealing finds a set of fragments (orange squares) optimizing the score function; a null placement (empty squares) may be assigned in positions where no good placements have been identified. Fourth, a partial model is assembled by combining fragment placements from multiple Monte Carlo trajectories. Steps 1\u20134 are carried out iteratively until ~70% of sequence is covered. Finally, unassigned regions in the final partial model are completed using density-guided loop sampling followed by all-atom refinement. (b) Model building for the 20S α-subunit in a 4.8-Å resolution cryo-EM map required three iterations, illustrated in the three rows in the figure. The far left column shows the density map used for the corresponding iteration after density from the previous round's partial model was masked out. The next column shows the assembled partial models after Monte Carlo sampling (colored blue at the N terminus to red at the C terminus). Center, fragment placement results after translation and rotation search. The x axis covers the sequence of the protein, and each black point represents a single fragment placement; the y axis indicates the distance of the fragment placement from the native conformation. Pink points indicate fragments chosen to assemble the partial model, and the gray shading shows residues covered in the partial model. Secondary structural elements in the native protein are indicated above the plot: H, helix; S, strand. Right, the lowest-scoring Monte Carlo trajectories (below the dotted line) are combined to provide the starting model for the next iteration. Each point represents the fragment assignment of an independent search trajectory, colored by number of total fragments placed. The x axis indicates the percentage of fragments placed within 2.5-Å RMSD from the native configuration; the y axis shows the score with the fragment compatibility function. The horizontal dashed line shows the score cutoff used for partial model generation. Figure 2: High-accuracy model building in near-atomic-resolution cryo-EM maps.

Right and far right, full-length RosettaCM models (red) superimposed with the experimentally determined structures (blue). Shown is the lowest-RMSD structure for each protein, determined from the ten models with the lowest electron density scores (right), with a close-up of the core showing that native core packing is recovered (far right).

Illustrated are the density map (left), the partial model at the iteration with highest accuracy (middle), and the native structure (right).

However, engineering of complex circuits in mammalian cells is currently limited by the availability of well-characterized and orthogonal transcriptional repressors. Here, we introduce a library of 26 reversible transcription activator\u2013like effector repressors (TALERs) that bind newly designed hybrid promoters and exert transcriptional repression through steric hindrance of key transcriptional initiation elements. We demonstrate that using the input-output transfer curves of our TALERs enables accurate prediction of the behavior of modularly assembled TALER cascade and switch circuits. We also show that TALER switches using feedback regulation exhibit improved accuracy for microRNA-based HeLa cancer cell classification versus HEK293 cells. Our TALER library is a valuable toolkit for modular engineering of synthetic circuits, enabling programmable manipulation of mammalian cells and helping elucidate design principles of coupled transcriptional and microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation.

        "text": "Light reflection and refraction at an interface between two homogeneous media is analytically described by Snell's law. For a beam with a finite waist, it turns out that the reflected wave experiences a lateral displacement from its position predicted by geometric optics. Such Goos-Hänchen (G-H) effect has been extensively investigated among all kinds of optical media, such as dielectrics, metals, photonic crystals and metamaterials. As a fundamental physics phenomenon, the G-H effect has been extended to acoustics and quantum mechanics. Here we report the unusual G-H effect in zero index metamaterials. We show that when linearly polarized light is obliquely incident from air to epsilon-near-zero metamaterials, no G-H effect could be observed for p polarized light. While for s polarization, the G-H shift is a constant value for any incident angle. Subject terms: Metamaterials\u2022 Micro-optics At a glance Figures View all figures Figure 1: The schematic diagram of G-H effect for a linearly polarized light totally reflected at an interface. Region 1 and 2 are air and ENZ metamaterial, respectively. If the obliquely incident light from air is of p polarization, there is no G-H shift for the reflected light, as shown by the blue line. If the incident light is of s polarization, the G-H shift d is a constant value for any incident angle, as shown by the red line, and the lateral shift is indicated by L. Region 1 and 2 are infinitely extended in x and y directions. Full size image View in article Figure 2: The G - H shifts for ENZ metamaterials with different losses.

The pre-deposited indium atoms before InGaN well layer growth are first carried out to prevent indium atoms exchange between the subsurface layer and the surface layer, which results from the indium segregation. The uniform spatial distribution of indium content is achieved in each InGaN well layer, as long as indium pre-deposition is sufficient. According to the consistency of the experiment and numerical simulation, the indium content increases from 16% along the growth direction and saturates at 19% in the upper interface, which cannot be determined precisely by the traditional method.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information The noncovalent forces that stabilize protein structures are not fully understood. One way to address this is to study equilibria between unfolded states and α-helices in peptides. Electrostatic forces\u2014which include interactions between side chains, the backbone and side chains, and side chains and the helix macrodipole\u2014are believed to contribute to these equilibria. Here we probe these interactions experimentally using designed peptides. We find that both terminal backbone\u2013side chain and certain side chain\u2013side chain interactions (which include both local effects between proximal charges and interatomic contacts) contribute much more to helix stability than side chain\u2013helix macrodipole electrostatics, which are believed to operate at larger distances. This has implications for current descriptions of helix stability, the understanding of protein folding and the refinement of force fields for biomolecular modeling and simulations. In addition, this study sheds light on the stability of rod-like structures formed by single α-helices, which are common in natural proteins such as non-muscle myosins.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information Linking neural microcircuit function to emergent properties of the mammalian brain requires fine-scale manipulation and measurement of neural activity during behavior, where each neuron's coding and dynamics can be characterized. We developed an optical method for simultaneous cellular-resolution stimulation and large-scale recording of neuronal activity in behaving mice. Dual-wavelength two-photon excitation allowed largely independent functional imaging with a green fluorescent calcium sensor (GCaMP3, λ = 920 ± 6 nm) and single-neuron photostimulation with a red-shifted optogenetic probe (C1V1, λ = 1,064 ± 6 nm) in neurons coexpressing the two proteins. We manipulated task-modulated activity in individual hippocampal CA1 place cells during spatial navigation in a virtual reality environment, mimicking natural place-field activity, or 'biasing', to reveal subthreshold dynamics. Notably, manipulating single place-cell activity also affected activity in small groups of other place cells that were active around the same time in the task, suggesting a functional role for local place cell interactions in shaping firing fields. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Schematic for simultaneous cellular-resolution photostimulation and functional calcium-imaging in awake, behaving mice. (a) Neurons expressing a green calcium sensor (GCaMP3) and a red-shifted optogenetic probe (C1V1(E122T/E162T)-2A-EYFP; red) visualized in awake mice using TPE imaging were selected as targets for TPE photostimulation. Each target cell was stimulated by transient illumination with a temporally focused 'spot' around the size of a soma (10\u201315 μm). Bottom left, CCD images of TPE fluorescence illustrating in-plane (xy) and projected axial (xz) illumination profiles of the photostimulation spot. Bottom right, image of a patterned photostimulation scan (dwell time of 0.5 ms per location; CCD integration time of 1,000 ms). Arrows indicate the repeat scan trajectory between targets. (b) Two laser-scanning TPE systems (imaging and photostimulation) were combined in a custom microscope to image (λ = 920 nm) and stimulate (λ = 1,064 nm) coexpressing hippocampal CA1 neurons in awake, mobile or behaving mice. ex., excitation path; em., emitted fluorescence detection path; PMTs, photomultiplier tubes; HP, headplate holders. (c) The combined instrument (optical path schematic, left) used a VR system to create a virtual environment in which mice could be trained to perform visually guided behaviors, and large-scale optical recordings were used to characterize neuron population activity. Single neurons of interest were selected and stimulated at designated times in the behavior, synchronized using custom VR software29.

Figure 2: All-optical stimulation and recording of neural activity in awake mice. (a) TPE fluorescence image of CA1 hippocampal neurons expressing GCaMP3 (green) and C1V1(E122T/E162T)-2A-EYFP (red) in an awake mouse. Inset, images of unmixed GCaMP3 and EYFP (top panels) and a pseudocolor merge (bottom panel; image sizes 25 × 65 μm). Somatic GCaMP3 appeared annular from nuclear exclusion, whereas EYFP was diffuse. (b) Simultaneous optical stimulation and imaging of activity in a targeted neuron (indicated in top panel). Bottom, GCaMP3 fluorescence images during one stimulation and imaging time series (frame interval of 0.125 s, target is shown in red during a 10 Hz × 0.05-s stimulation pulse-train). 1,064-nm stimulation evoked a GCaMP3 transient in the targeted cell that was detected using 920-nm imaging. (c) Somatic ΔF/F traces (GCaMP3, green) recorded during photostimulation using two-channel fluorescence detection and linear unmixing (5-trial average, 10 × 0.05-s pulses at 20 and 10 Hz during underlined periods). Evoked GCaMP3 transients were separable from optical stimulation artifacts (EYFP fluorescence, red traces), allowing continuous imaging during stimulation. (d) Estimate of activity induced by imaging opsin-expressing neurons. Rates of spontaneous activity versus imaging laser power for several neuron populations with increasing C1V1 expression (estimated by EYFP/GCaMP3 intensity and depicted by soma cartoons). Low-power imaging (~40 mW) produced minimal changes in spontaneous activity in coexpressing neurons compared with neurons with little or no detectable C1V1-EYFP expression (error bars indicate mean ± s.d.; mean ± s.d. of lowest-expressing group at 40 mW is shown in shaded area). Figure 3: Cellular-resolution photostimulation in awake mice. (a) Specificity of cell-targeted photostimulation using focused single-photon excitation (SPE) versus TPE. Left, images of an isolated coexpressing CA1 neuron with the 1,064- or 473-nm target positions overlaid. Right, GCaMP3 ΔF/F traces measured during stimulation targeting those locations using TPE or SPE (all traces are averages of >3 trials). TPE and SPE both evoked responses when the cell was targeted, whereas only SPE evoked responses when it was not. (b) Spatial resolution of TPE and SPE photostimulation. Evoked response amplitudes for different displacements between target cells and neighboring cells laterally (as in a; solid lines) or axially (dashed lines; error bars indicate mean ± s.d.). Lateral resolution measurements (solid lines) include trials based on cellular fluorescence changes in nearby cells in densely labeled tissue (five cells, SPE; 101 cells, TPE). Inset, representative responses from one cell (centered in images) included in this measurement. Images represent post-stimulation minus pre-stimulation GCaMP3 fluorescence in each case (three-trial average). TPE and SPE evoked similar responses in targeted neurons, but responses were better confined to the target cell using TPE. (c) Matrix of TPE-stimulated responses from 17 cellular targets (indicated at top right), with significant responses shown in red (Online Methods). Each entry shows activity in one cell (given by row number) during stimulation targeting one cell (column number). Most responsive cells could be stimulated independently (two exceptions here are indicated in the image). Bottom right, TPE stimulation\u2013triggered response profile (analogous to a point-spread function in imaging), shown as an image (normalized post-minus pre-stimulation GCaMP3 fluorescence, averaged across stimulation trials targeting 101 different cells). Figure 4: Optical perturbation of a place cell during virtual navigation. (a) Schematic and experimental examples of place cell perturbation. A trained mouse ran along a 400-cm VR track (upper left). A neuron with a place field in this environment (gray shaded region) was stimulated while the mouse ran through a different part of the track (red shaded region). Single-trial examples of place-cell activity (ΔF/F traces) are shown below for imaging-only and stimulation traversals. Right, activity in the targeted place cell throughout the behavior session (alternating control (ctrl) and stimulation (stim) traversals are shown in black and red, respectively). Position in the environment (gray) and periods of significant transients (colored dots) are shown below, with session averages above (bold lines). Place-specific stimulation mimicked the activity observed in the place field. (b) Intensity maps of spatially modulated activity in neurons from the recorded population (shown in c). Red arrowheads indicate the targeted cell. (c) Secondary effects of stimulation. Left, image of the neurons recorded in this session (target cell, TC). Right, spatial activity profile in the TC, two other cells that showed significantly increased in-field activity during stimulation trials (cells 1 and 2, P = 0.015 and P = 0.028) and three other cells (no difference). Stimulating one place cell increased activity in other neurons with nearby place fields. Concatenated single-trial ΔF/F traces for three cells are shown below. (d) Neuronal circuit trajectories. Left, mean state-space trajectories of population activity during stimulation and control trials (41 cells, TC excluded), visualized using the first three common factors (Online Methods). Right, Euclidean distance between control and stimulation trial trajectories. Stimulating this place cell perturbed activity in other place cells during navigation. Figure 5: Low-power biasing to measure underlying dynamics in neurons and networks. (a) Schematic. Low-power stimulation biases a neuron, producing ΔF/F transients preferentially when Vm is near Vthr. (b) Biasing place cells. Left, place cell activity (field shaded gray) during imaging versus low-power biasing traversals (black and red). Averaged across trials (above), biasing increased activity asymmetrically, leading up to the place field. Top right, activity overlaid across all trials (gray dots, lines are averages). Bottom right, two additional examples of place cells biased by low-power stimulation. (c) Biasing silent cells. Data are presented as in b, but show activity arising from biasing two silent cells (no spatial field during imaging trials). Biasing was able to reveal spatial receptive fields (here, centered around 140 and 190 cm). (d) Fraction of receptive field traversals with in-field activity (30 cells) in imaging versus biasing traversals (field locations for silent cells determined using stimulation trials). Thick lines are the group average. (e) Secondary responses to biasing. Left, FOV from one place-cell biasing experiment (target cell and three others are indicated). Right, ΔF/F traces of neurons with significantly different activity in bias versus control trials (arrows indicate sign of the change). Difference maps (below) represent stimulation minus control for all affected cells in the population. A separate example (including all affected cells) is presented in the second column. Biasing one place cell affected activity in others with nearby fields. (f) Data are presented as in e, but low-power stimulation was applied to three cells at once (TC1\u20133). Average traces (below) are selected from 24 non-targeted cells differing significantly in bias versus control trials. (g) Neuronal circuit trajectories. Data are presented as in Figure 4d, but comparing imaging-only versus bias traversals (54 cells analyzed, 3 target cells excluded). Biasing three place cells perturbed population activity around the firing fields of those cells. Supplementary Fig. 1: Spectral properties of molecules, laser sources, and optics used in this approach. a. Visible-wavelength regime. Shown are: fluorescence emission spectra for EGFP and EYFP (obtained from the Tsien Lab website, University of California, San Diego); the single-photon excitation spectrum for C1V1(E122T/E162T) (adapted from Yizhar et al., Nature 477, 171-178 [2011]); transmission curves for the dichroic (dark line) and emission filters (shaded areas) used in two-channel fluorescence detection (filter part numbers indicated); and the transmission curve for the long-pass laser-blocking filter (blue line; curves from Semrock). The 473 nm laser line used in single-photon excitation experiments is also indicated (dashed blue line). Each curve is normalized to its own peak value. b. Infrared-wavelength regime. Two-photon action cross section for GCaMP3 (green) and relative C1V1 photocurrent response amplitudes (see inset) sampled at two infrared TPE center wavelengths (λ=900 nm and λ=1050 nm). Inset: sample intracellular photocurrents from illuminated HEK293T cells expressing C1V1; peak squared-intensity values were similar (2.76x1054 γ2/cm4-s2 and 1.68x1054 γ2/cm4-s2 at 900 nm and 1050 nm; assuming a fixed output temporal pulse-width). The GCaMP3 action cross-section was measured using fluorescence excited by focused low-power illumination (regime of quadratic power dependence) of a purified GCaMP3.3 sample (37 μM concentration in 20 mM MOPS, 100 mM KCl, 2.7 mM K2CaEGTA, at pH 7.4; R. Sun and S. S.-H. Wang, Princeton), normalized at each wavelength using side-by-side measurements of a reference fluorophore (20 µM fluorescein in water, pH 11; see Albota, M. A., Xu, C. & Webb, W., Appl. Opt. 37, 7352\u20137356 [1998]). C1V1 wavelength-sensitivity was evaluated at two spectral bands (λ=900 nm and 1050 nm), using whole-cell electrode recordings at constant voltage (-50 mV) in HEK293T cells transiently expressing the pLenti-CaMKIIa-C1V1(E162T)-TS-EYFP construct with focused scanning methods and an apparatus described previously (Rickgauer and Tank, PNAS 106, 15025-15030 [2009]). Supplementary Fig. 2: Schematic for either single-photon or two-photon excitation (TPE) photostimulation and TPE imaging. a. Position of optics used to introduce the SPE source into the TPE microscope head. Abbreviations: AM, alignment mirror; FT, focusing telescope; SP, short-pass filter; DC, dichroic filter; LP, long-pass filter; PMTs, photomultiplier tubes. b. TPE images (acquired at 920 nm) of a volume in a fluorescent plastic slide after bleaching neighboring areas using SPE (473 nm) and TPE (1064 nm, spatial focusing path; SF in Fig. 1, main text). Image intensity is inverted. Images are shown at the 1064 nm focal plane (upper) and as an xz projection of a through-focus series (lower). Supplementary Fig. 3: TPE stimulation evokes GCaMP3 transients consistent with action potentials (APs) and opsin-mediated depolarization in awake mice. a. GCaMP3 ΔF/F values vs. stimulation pulse number. Somatic ΔF/F values for 6 neurons stimulated at 5, 10, and 20 Hz (16 ms per pulse), measured 500 ms after pulse-train onset (values for each cell are normalized to the peak response; average of 3-7 trials per data point). The monotonic relationship between ΔF/F and stimulation pulse number is consistent with a regime in which ΔF/F values also scale approximately linearly with AP number (assuming 1 AP per pulse; Tian et al., Nat. Methods 6, 875-881 [2009]). Inset: sample traces from one neuron stimulated with 10 pulses at 5, 10, and 20 Hz (each trace is a 5-trial average). Colored underlines indicate the corresponding stim. train period. Dashed line indicates the time at which values ΔF/F values were measured (500 ms after stim. onset). b. Histogram of measured GCaMP3 fluorescence transient half-decay times following offset of a photostimulation epoch (τ1/2 calculated from single-exponential decay fits). Following stim. offset, transients evoked in cells returned to resting levels with off-kinetics (τ1/2 = 375+/-196 ms; mean +/- s.d.) in the range observed in vivo during trains of electrically stimulated APs (τ1/2 = 384+/-76 ms for 10 APs; Tian et al., Nat. Methods 6, 875-881 [2009]). c. Peak GCaMP3 transient amplitude during raster-scanning photostimulation of a cell using the spatial focusing path (SF in Fig. 1, main text) shown for different TPE raster-scan periods, which varied by changing the number of lines in a raster-scan, and which were repeated over an interval of 512 ms. The dashed line indicates the approximate C1V1(t/t) inactivation time-constant (τoff = 40-50 ms; Mattis et al., Nat. Methods 9, 159-172 [2012]; Prakash et al., Nat. Methods 9, 1171-1179 [2012]). Faster-scanning photostimulation trials (Ts< τoff) produced larger-amplitude responses than slower-scanning trials (Ts> τoff; n=31 target cells; values for each cell normalized by maximum amplitude in that cell). This relationship is a signature of membrane depolarization mediated by scanning recruitment of opsin probes (Rickgauer and Tank, PNAS 106, 15025-15030 [2009]; Prakash et al., Nat. Methods 9, 1171-1179 [2012]; Packer et al., Nat. Methods 9, 1202-1205 [2012]). Inset: Exemplary ΔF/F traces from one cell illustrating this relationship (colors indicate scan periods of same-color dots in panel; bars indicate s.d.).

        "text": "Ni-based single superalloys play a crucial role in the hottest parts of jet engines. However, due to the complex geometry and macro-segregation during the solidification process, the cast defect such as stray grains is inevitable. Therefore, the transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding which can join several small single crystalline castings together is gradually believed to be an effective method for improving the yields of production of the complex components. The melting point depressant element B is always added into the interlayer filler material. Consequently, borides including the M3B2 and M5B3 phase usually precipitate during the TLP bonding process. So a comprehensive knowledge of the fine structural characteristics of the borides is very critical for an accurate evaluation of the TLP bonding process. In this work, by means of the aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, we show, at an atomic scale, the Wyckoff positional order phenomenon of the metal atoms in the unit cell of M3B2- and M5B3-type boride. Meanwhile, the defect along the (001) plane of the above two types of boride are determined to be the polyhedral intergrowth with complex configurations.

By using arbitrary nine kinds of rubbers as matrices, we experimentally demonstrate that the matching the solubility parameter of CNTs and the rubber matrix is important to achieve higher electrical conductivity in CNT/rubber composite, resulting in continuous conductive pathways leading to electrical conductivities as high as 15 S/cm with 10 vol% CNT in fluorinated rubber. Further, using thermodynamic considerations, we demonstrate an approach to mix CNTs to arbitrary rubber matrices regardless of solubility parameter of matrices by adding small amounts of fluorinated rubber as a polymeric-compatibilizer of CNTs. We thereby achieved electrical conductivities ranging from 1.2 to 13.8 S/cm (10 vol% CNTs) using nine varieties of rubber matrices differing in chemical structures and physical properties. Finally, we investigated the components of solubility parameter of CNT by using Hansen solubility parameters, these findings may useful for controlling solubility parameter of CNTs.

        "text": "A highly excited atom having an electron that has moved into a level with large principal quantum number is a hydrogen-like object, termed a Rydberg atom. The giant size of Rydberg atoms1 leads to huge interaction effects. Monitoring these interactions has provided insights into atomic and molecular physics on the single-quantum level. Excitons\u2014the fundamental optical excitations in semiconductors2, consisting of an electron and a positively charged hole\u2014are the condensed-matter analogues of hydrogen. Highly excited excitons with extensions similar to those of Rydberg atoms are of interest because they can be placed and moved in a crystal with high precision using microscopic energy potential landscapes. The interaction of such Rydberg excitons may allow the formation of ordered exciton phases or the sensing of elementary excitations in their surroundings on a quantum level. Here we demonstrate the existence of Rydberg excitons in the copper oxide Cu2O, with principal quantum numbers as large as n = 25. These states have giant wavefunction extensions (that is, the average distance between the electron and the hole) of more than two micrometres, compared to about a nanometre for the ground state. The strong dipole\u2013dipole interaction between such excitons is indicated by a blockade effect in which the presence of one exciton prevents the excitation of another in its vicinity. Subject terms: Atomic and molecular physics\u2022 Semiconductors At a glance Figures Figure 1: High-resolution absorption spectra of yellow P excitons in Cu2O. a, Spectra are measured with a single-frequency laser on a natural sample of thickness 34 µm at 1.2 K.

The red line is a guide for the eye. The grey line presents a single-beam absorption spectrum in this energy range, proving that the absorption is quenched more strongly when the pump laser is tuned to an exciton resonance. We note the slight line shifts between the resonances in the two spectra arising from exciton\u2013exciton interaction. Owing to the variation of the exciton separation in the laser spot, these shifts cannot be assessed quantitatively, for which one would have to control the exciton position. f, Influence of a magnetic field on the Rydberg blockade.

        "text": "If an object is very small in size compared with the wavelength of light, it does not scatter light efficiently. It is hence difficult to detect a very small object with light. We show using analytic theory as well as full wave numerical calculation that the effective polarizability of a small cylinder can be greatly enhanced by coupling it with a superlens type metamaterial slab. This kind of enhancement is not due to the individual resonance effect of the metamaterial slab, nor due to that of the object, but is caused by a collective resonant mode between the cylinder and the slab. We show that this type of particle-slab resonance which makes a small two-dimensional object much \u201cbrighter\u201d is actually closely related to the reverse effect known in the literature as \u201ccloaking by anomalous resonance\u201d which can make a small cylinder undetectable. We also show that the enhancement of polarizability can lead to strongly enhanced electromagnetic forces that can be attractive or repulsive, depending on the material properties of the cylinder.

        "text": "MoS2 is a layered two-dimensional material with strong spin-orbit coupling and long spin lifetime, which is promising for electronic and spintronic applications. However, because of its large band gap and small electron affinity, a considerable Schottky barrier exists between MoS2 and contact metal, hindering the further study of spin transport and spin injection in MoS2. Although substantial progress has been made in improving device performance, the existence of metal-semiconductor Schottky barrier has not yet been fully understood. Here, we investigate permalloy (Py) contacts to both multilayer and monolayer MoS2. Ohmic contact is developed between multilayer MoS2 and Py electrodes with a negative Schottky barrier, which yields a high field-effect mobility exceeding 55 cm2V−1s−1 at low temperature. Further, by applying back gate voltage and inserting different thickness of Al2O3 layer between the metal and monolayer MoS2, we have achieved a good tunability of the Schottky barrier height (down to zero). These results are important in improving the performance of MoS2 transistor devices; and it may pave the way to realize spin transport and spin injection in MoS2.

        "text": "The vertical composition profile of active layer has a major effect on the performance of organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs). While stepwise deposition of different materials is a conceptually straightforward method for controlled preparation of multi-component active layers, it is practically challenging for solution processes because of dissolution of the lower layer. Herein, we overcome this difficulty by employing the photoprecursor approach, in which a soluble photoprecursor is solution-deposited then photoconverted in situ to a poorly soluble organic semiconductor. This approach enables solution-processing of the p-i-n triple-layer architecture that has been suggested to be effective in obtaining efficient OPVs. We show that, when 2,6-dithienylanthracene and a fullerene derivative PC71BM are used as donor and acceptor, respectively, the best p-i-n OPV affords a higher photovoltaic efficiency than the corresponding p-n device by 24% and bulk-heterojunction device by 67%. The photoprecursor approach is also applied to preparation of three-component p-i-n films containing another donor 2,6-bis(5\u2032-(2-ethylhexyl)-(2,2\u2032-bithiophen)-5-yl)anthracene in the i-layer to provide a nearly doubled efficiency as compared to the original two-component p-i-n system. These results indicate that the present approach can serve as an effective means for controlled preparation of well-performing multi-component active layers in OPVs and related organic electronic devices.

        "text": "The control of ion trans-membrane transport through graphene oxide (GO) membranes is achieved by electric and magnetic fields. Electric field can either increase or decrease the ion transport through GO membranes depending on its direction, and magnetic field can enhance the ion penetration monotonically. When electric field is applied across GO membrane, excellent control of ion fluidic flows can be done. With the magnetic field, the effective anchoring of ions is demonstrated but the modulation of the ion flowing directions does not occur. The mechanism of the electro- and magneto-modulated ion trans-membrane transport is investigated, indicating that the electric fields dominate the ion migration process while the magnetic fields tune the structure of nanocapillaries within GO membranes. Results also show that the ion selectivity of GO membranes can be tuned with the electric fields while the transport of ions can be enhanced synchronously with the magnetic fields. These excellent properties make GO membranes promising in areas such as field-induced mass transport control and membrane separation.

The hinge-like structure of BP brings unusual mechanical responses such as anisotropic Young's modulus and negative Poisson's ratio. A sensitive electronic structure of BP makes it transform among metal, direct and indirect semiconductors under strain. The maximal figure of merit ZT of BP is found to be 0.72 at 800 K that could be enhanced to 0.87 by exerting an appropriate strain, revealing BP could be a potential medium-high temperature TE material. Such strain-induced enhancements of TE performance are often observed to occur at the boundary of the direct-indirect band gap transition, which can be attributed to the increase of degeneracy of energy valleys at the transition point. By comparing the structure of BP with SnSe, a family of potential TE materials with hinge-like structure are suggested. This study not only exposes various novel properties of BP under strain, but also proposes effective strategies to seek for better TE materials.

        "text": "Finite control of pore size distributions is a highly desired attribute when producing porous materials. While many methodologies strive to produce such materials through one-pot strategies, oftentimes the pore structure requires post-treatment modification. In this study, modulation of pore size in cobalt-silica systems was investigated by a novel, non-destructive, self-templated method. These systems were produced from two cobalt-containing silica starting materials which differed by extent of condensation. These starting materials, sol (SG\u2032) and xerogel (XG\u2032), were mixed with pure silica sol to produce materials containing 5\u201340 mol% Co. The resultant SG-series materials exhibited typical attributes for cobalt-silica systems: mesoporous characteristics developed at high cobalt concentrations, coinciding with Co3O4 formation; whereas, in the XG-series materials, these mesoporous characteristics were extensively suppressed. Based on an examination of the resultant materials a mechanism describing the pore size formation and modulation of the two systems was proposed. Pore size modulation in the XG-series was caused, in part, by the cobalt source acting as an autogenous template for the condensation of the silica network. These domains could be modified when wetted, allowing for the infiltration and subsequent condensation of silica oligomers into the pre-formed, mesoporous cages, leading to a reduction in the mesoporous content of the final product.

        "text": "Fluorescence polarization measurements in the condensed phase provide rich information on rotational dynamics and interactions between macromolecules. An important parameter in these studies is the limiting polarization or po which is the emission polarization in the absence of molecular rotation. Here we explore how molecular number averaging affects the observed value of po. Using a simple mathematical model we show that for a collection of fluorescent dipoles (1\u201350 molecules) the fluorescence polarization (p) increases with the number of molecules (N) due to the progressive onset of photo-selection with a relation of the form p = po(1 − N−β). This concept is demonstrated experimentally using single molecule polarization measurements of perylene diimide dye molecules in a rigid polymer matrix where it is shown that the average emission polarization increases significantly when the number of molecules per averaging window is increased from 1 to 10 molecules. These results suggest that the definition of limiting polarization needs to be refined in the quasi-single molecule regime. Moreover, these results pave a new way for measuring clustering of molecules from single cluster polarization histograms.

        "text": "Lithium-oxygen batteries with high theoretical energy densities have great potential. Recent studies have focused on different cathode architecture design to address poor cycling performance, while the impact of interface stability on cathode side has been barely reported. In this study, we introduce CoO mesoporous spheres into cathode, where the growth of crystalline discharge products (Li2O2) is directly observed on the CoO surface from aberration-corrected STEM. This CoO based cathode demonstrates more than 300 discharge/charge cycles with excessive lithium anode. Under deep discharge/charge, CoO cathode exhibited superior cycle performance than that of Co3O4 with similar nanostructure. This improved cycle performance can be ascribed to a more favorable adsorption configuration of Li2O2 intermediates (LiO2) on CoO surface, which is demonstrated through DFT calculation. The favorable adsorption of LiO2 plays an important role in the enhanced cycle performance, which reduced the contact of LiO2 to carbon materials and further alleviated the side reactions during charge process. This compatible interface design may provide an effective approach in protecting carbon-based cathodes in metal-oxygen batteries.

        "text": "Direct conversion from heat to electricity is one of the important technologies for a sustainable society since large quantities of energy are wasted as heat. We report the development of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)-based high conversion efficiency, air-stable and flexible thermoelectric material. We prepared cobaltocene-encapsulated SWNTs (denoted CoCp2@SWNTs) and revealed that the material showed a negative-type (n-type) semiconducting behaviour (Seebeck coefficient: −41.8 μV K−1 at 320 K). The CoCp2@SWNT film was found to show a high electrical conductivity (43,200 S m−1 at 320 K) and large power factor (75.4 μW m−1 K−2) and the performance was remarkably stable under atmospheric conditions over a wide range of temperatures. The thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) value of the CoCp2@SWNT film (0.157 at 320 K) was highest among the reported n-type organic thermoelectric materials due to the large power factor and low thermal conductivity (0.15 W m−1 K−1). These characteristics of the n-type CoCp2@SWNTs allowed us to fabricate a p-n type thermoelectric device by combination with an empty SWNT-based p-type film. The fabricated device exhibited a highly efficient power generation close to the calculated values even without any air-protective coating due to the high stability of the SWNT-based materials under atmospheric conditions.

        "text": "Visualization of morphological dynamics of live cells with nanometer resolution under physiological conditions is highly desired, but challenging. It has been demonstrated that high-speed atomic force microscopy is a powerful technique for visualizing dynamics of biomolecules under physiological conditions. However, application of high-speed atomic force microscopy for imaging larger objects such as live mammalian cells has been complicated because of the collision between the cantilever and samples. Here, we demonstrate that attaching an extremely long (~3 μm) and thin (~5 nm) tip by amorphous carbon to the cantilever allows us to image the surface structure of live cells with the spatiotemporal resolution of nanometers and seconds. We demonstrate that long-tip high-speed atomic force microscopy is capable of imaging morphogenesis of filopodia, membrane ruffles, pit formation, and endocytosis in COS-7, HeLa cells and hippocampal neurons.

        "text": "A new nozzle system for the efficient production of multi-layered nanofibers through electrospinning is reported. Developed a decade ago, the commonly used coaxial nozzle system consisting of two concentric cylindrical needles has remained unchanged, despite recent advances in multi-layered, multi-functional nanofibers. Here, we demonstrate a core-cut nozzle system, in which the exit pipe of the core nozzle is removed such that the core fluid can form an envelope inside the shell solution. This configuration effectively improves the coaxial electrospinning behavior of two fluids and significantly reduces the jet instability, which was proved by finite element simulation. The proposed electrospinning nozzle system was then used to fabricate bi- and tri-layered carbon nanofibers. Subject terms: Nanowires\u2022 Synthesis and processing At a glance Figures View all figures Figure 1: Schematic diagram of the coaxial nozzle system and the three nozzle systems tested in simulation to investigate the effect of exit pipe length of the core nozzle on the fluidic behavior of the core and shell solutions.

The numbers (1 through 5) represent the time elapsed after simulation (0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.08, and 0.1 s, respectively). The gray color indicates the interface between the fluids; i.e., the outer and inner gray envelopes represent the interfaces between the poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN) shell solution and the environment (air) outside the shell nozzle, and between the PAN shell and core (air) fluids, respectively. For understanding purposes, the gray envelopes can be thought of as core and shell fluid surfaces. The envelope formation and its thinning behavior, in particular their progression over time, were dependent on the length of the exit pipe of the core nozzle. As the exit pipe of the core nozzle was shortened, the growth of the envelope of the core fluid was delayed by a sharp thinning of the core fluid, making the core fluid thinner within the exit pipe of the shell nozzle.

        "text": "Magnesium ferrite is a very important magnetic material due to its interesting magnetic and electrical properties and its chemical and thermal stability. Here we report on the magnetic and transport properties of epitaxial MgFe2O4 thin films grown on MgO (001) by molecular beam epitaxy. The structural properties and chemical composition of the MgFe2O4 films were characterized by X-Ray diffraction and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. The nonsaturation of the magnetization in high magnetic fields observed for M (H) measurements and the linear negative magnetoresistance (MR) curves indicate the presence of anti-phase boundaries (APBs) in MgFe2O4. The presence of APBs was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, post annealing decreases the resistance and enhances the MR of the film, suggesting migration of the APBs. Our results may be valuable for the application of MgFe2O4 in spintronics.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information Graphene oxide (GO) films are known to be highly stable in \u200bwater and this property has made their use in membrane applications in solution possible. However, this state of affairs is somewhat counterintuitive because GO sheets become negatively charged on hydration and the membrane should disintegrate owing to electrostatic repulsion. We have now discovered a long-overlooked reason behind this apparent contradiction. Our findings show that neat GO membranes do, indeed, readily disintegrate in \u200bwater, but the films become stable if they are crosslinked by multivalent cationic metal contaminants. Such metal contaminants can be introduced unintentionally during the synthesis and processing of GO, most notably on filtration with anodized \u200baluminium oxide filter discs that corrode to release significant amounts of aluminium ions. This finding has wide implications in interpreting the processing\u2013structure\u2013property relationships of GO and other lamellar membranes. We also discuss strategies to avoid and mitigate metal contamination and demonstrate that this effect can be exploited to synthesize new membrane materials.

        "text": "The growth of ultra-thin KCl films on the Si(111)7 × 7 reconstructed surface has been investigated as a function of KCl coverage and substrate temperature. The structure and morphology of the films were characterized by means of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. Detailed analysis of the atomically resolved STM images of islands grown at room and high temperatures (400 K\u2013430 K) revealed the presence of KCl(001) and KCl(111) islands with the ratio between both structures depending on the growth temperature. At room temperature, the growth of the first layer, which covers the initial Si(111)7 × 7 surface, contains double/triple atomic layers of KCl(001) with a small fraction of KCl(111) islands. The high temperature growth promotes the appearance of large KCl(111) areas, which are built up by three atomic layers. At room and high temperatures, flat and atomically well-defined ultra-thin KCl films can be grown on the Si(111)7 × 7 substrate. The formation of the above mentioned (111) polar films is interpreted as a result of the thermally activated dissociative adsorption of KCl molecules on Si(111)7 × 7, which produces an excess of potassium on the Si surface.

        "text": "A superoscillation wave is a special superposition of propagating electromagnetic (EM) waves which varies with sub-diffraction resolution inside a fixed region. This special property allows superoscillation waves to carry sub-diffraction details of an object into the far-field, and makes it an attractive candidate technology for super-resolution devices. However, the Shannon limit seemingly requires that superoscillations must exist alongside high-energy sidebands, which can impede its widespread application. In this work we show that, contrary to prior understanding, one can selectively synthesize a portion of a superoscillation wave and thereby remove its high-energy region. Moreover, we show that by removing the high-energy region of a superoscillation wave-based imaging device, one can increase its power efficiency by two orders of magnitude. We describe the concept behind this development, elucidate conditions under which this phenomenon occurs, then report fullwave simulations which demonstrate the successful, power-efficient generation of sub-wavelength focal spots from propagating waves.

        "text": "Search for materials with a large nontrivial band gap is quite crucial for the realization of the devices using quantum spin Hall (QSH) effects. From first-principles calculations combined with a tight-binding (TB) model, we demonstrate that a trivial GaAs film with atomic thickness can be driven to a topological insulator with a sizable band gap by tensile strain. The strain-induced band inversion is responsible for the electronic structure transition. The nontrivial band gap due to spin-orbital coupling (SOC) is about 257 meV, sufficiently larger for the realization of QSH states at room temperature. This work suggests a possible route to the fabrication of QSH-based devices using the well-developed GaAs technology.

        "text": "Scientists and laymen alike have always been fascinated by the ability of lenses and mirrors to control light. Now, with the advent of metamaterials and their two-dimensional counterpart metasurfaces, such components can be miniaturized and designed with additional functionalities, holding promise for system integration. To demonstrate this potential, here ultrathin reflection metasurfaces (also called metamirrors) designed for focusing terahertz radiation into a single spot and four spaced spots are proposed and experimentally investigated at the frequency of 0.35 THz. Each metasurface is designed using a computer-generated spatial distribution of the reflection phase. The phase variation within 360 deg is achieved via a topological morphing of the metasurface pattern from metallic patches to U-shaped and split-ring resonator elements, whose spectral response is derived from full-wave electromagnetic simulations. The proposed approach demonstrates a high-performance solution for creating low-cost and lightweight beam-shaping and beam-focusing devices for the terahertz band.

Its topological feature can be confirmed by the presence of band inversion, the derived effective Z2 invariant and the non-trivial surface states with the presence of Dirac cones. Interestingly, our calculations further demonstrated that NaBi exhibits the uniquely combined properties between the electron-phonon coupling superconductivity in nice agreement with recent experimental measurements and the obviously anisotropic but extremely low thermal conductivity. The spin-orbit coupling effects greatly affect those properties. NaBi may provide a rich platform to study the relationship among metal, topology, superconductivity and thermal conductivity.

        "text": "To reduce the antagonistic effect of jute fibre on the setting and hydration of jute reinforced cement, modified jute fibre reinforcement would be a unique approach. The present investigation deals with the effectiveness of mild alkali treated (0.5%) jute fibre on the setting and hydration behaviour of cement. Setting time measurement, hydration test and analytical characterizations of the hardened samples (viz., FTIR, XRD, DSC, TGA, and free lime estimation) were used to evaluate the effect of alkali treated jute fibre. From the hydration test, the time (t) required to reach maximum temperature for the hydration of control cement sample is estimated to be 860 min, whilst the time (t) is measured to be 1040 min for the hydration of a raw jute reinforced cement sample. However, the time (t) is estimated to be 1020 min for the hydration of an alkali treated jute reinforced cement sample. Additionally, from the analytical characterizations, it is determined that fibre-cement compatibility is increased and hydration delaying effect is minimized by using alkali treated jute fibre as fibre reinforcement.

        "text": "Topology, with its abstract mathematical constructs, often manifests itself in physics and has a pivotal role in our understanding of natural phenomena. Notably, the discovery of topological phases in condensed-matter systems has changed the modern conception of phases of matter1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The global nature of topological ordering, however, makes direct experimental probing an outstanding challenge. Present experimental tools are mainly indirect and, as a result, are inadequate for studying the topology of physical systems at a fundamental level. Here we employ the exquisite control afforded by state-of-the-art superconducting quantum circuits to investigate topological properties of various quantum systems. The essence of our approach is to infer geometric curvature by measuring the deflection of quantum trajectories in the curved space of the Hamiltonian6. Topological properties are then revealed by integrating the curvature over closed surfaces, a quantum analogue of the Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem. We benchmark our technique by investigating basic topological concepts of the historically important Haldane model7 after mapping the momentum space of this condensed-matter model to the parameter space of a single-qubit Hamiltonian. In addition to constructing the topological phase diagram, we are able to visualize the microscopic spin texture of the associated states and their evolution across a topological phase transition. Going beyond non-interacting systems, we demonstrate the power of our method by studying topology in an interacting quantum system. This required a new qubit architecture8, 9 that allows for simultaneous control over every term in a two-qubit Hamiltonian. By exploring the parameter space of this Hamiltonian, we discover the emergence of an interaction-induced topological phase. Our work establishes a powerful, generalizable experimental platform to study topological phenomena in quantum systems.

In this schematic drawing, brown arrows represent the ground states (adiabatic limit) for given points on a closed manifold (green enclosure, interrupted by an opening for the sake of illustration) in the Hamiltonian\u2019s parameter space, and the blue arrows are the measured states during a non-adiabatic passage. According to equation (2) in the main text, the Berry curvature B can be calculated from the deflection from adiabaticity. Integrating B over gives the Chern number , which corresponds to the total number of degeneracy points (such as the brown point) enclosed.

        "text": "Atomic manipulation in the scanning tunnelling microscopy, conventionally a tool to build nanostructures one atom at a time, is here employed to enable the atomic-scale imaging of a model low-dimensional system. Specifically, we use low-temperature STM to investigate an ultra thin film (4 atomic layers) of potassium created by epitaxial growth on a graphite substrate. The STM images display an unexpected honeycomb feature, which corresponds to a real-space visualization of the Wigner-Seitz cells of the close-packed surface K atoms. Density functional simulations indicate that this behaviour arises from the elastic, tip-induced vertical manipulation of potassium atoms during imaging, i.e. elastic atomic manipulation, and reflects the ultrasoft properties of the surface under strain. The method may be generally applicable to other soft e.g. molecular or biomolecular systems.

In some applications, they are subjected to friction and deformation during contact with each other and their surfaces on which they slide. Experimental studies directly comparing local and global deformation are lacking. This research performs nanoindentation (local deformation) and compression tests (global deformation) with a nanoindenter (sharp tip and flat punch, respectively) on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs), ~500 nm in diameter. Hardness of the MoS2 nanotube was similar to bulk and does not follow the \u201csmaller is stronger\u201d phenomenon as previously reported for other nano-objects. Tungsten disulfide (WS2) MWNTs, ~300 nm in diameter and carbon nanohorns (CNHs) 80\u2013100 nm in diameter were of interest and also selected for compression studies. These studies aid in understanding the mechanisms involved during global deformation when nano-objects are introduced to reduce friction and wear. For compression, highest loads were required for WS2 nanotubes, then MoS2 nanotubes and CNHs to achieve the same displacement. This was due to the greater number of defects with the MoS2 nanotubes and the flexibility of the CNHs. Repeat compression tests of nano-objects were performed showing a hardening effect for all three nano-objects.

Here we show that the long-held belief that the quantum spin fluctuations of the antiferromagnetic background play a key role in determining this dynamics is wrong. Indeed, we demonstrate that the correct, experimentally observed quasiparticle dispersion is generically obtained for a three-band model describing the hole moving on the oxygen sublattice and coupled to a Néel lattice of spins without spin fluctuations. We argue that results from one-band model studies actually support this conclusion, and that this significant conceptual change in our understanding of this phenomenology opens the way to studying few-hole dynamics, to accurately gauge the strength of the \u2018magnetic glue\u2019 and its contribution to superconductivity.

V2O5 nanobelts (VNBs) were formed in the presence of graphene oxide, a mild oxidant, which also enhanced the conductivity of GVNBs. From the electron energy loss spectroscopy analysis, the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) are inserted into the layered crystal structure of V2O5 nanobelts, which further confirmed the enhanced conductivity of the nanobelts. The electrochemical energy-storage capacity of GVNBs was investigated for supercapacitor applications. The specific capacitance of GVNBs was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and charge/discharge (CD) studies.

        "text": "Periodic segregation behaviors in fine mixtures of copper and alumina particles, including both percolation and eruption stages, are experimentally investigated by varying the ambient air pressure and vibrational acceleration. For the cases with moderate air pressure, the heaping profile of the granular bed keeps symmetrical in the whole periodic segregation. The symmetrical shape of the upper surface of the granular bed in the eruption stage, which resembles a miniature volcanic eruption, could be described by the Mogi model that illuminates the genuine volcanic eruption in the geography. When the air pressure increases, an asymmetrical heaping profile is observed in the eruption stage of periodic segregation. With using the image processing technique, we estimate a relative height difference between the copper and the alumina particles as the order parameter to quantitatively characterize the evolution of periodic segregation. Both eruption and percolation time, extracted from the order parameter, are plotted as a function of the vibration strength. Finally, we briefly discuss the air effect on the granular segregation behaviors.

Optical spectroscopic techniques including steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) were employed to investigate the electron transfer between graphene and n-type GaN at different temperatures. By comparing the near-band-edge excitonic emissions before and after the graphene covering, some structures in the excitonic PL spectra are found to show interesting changes. In particular, a distinct \u201cdip\u201d structure is found to develop at the center of the free exciton emission peak as the temperature goes up. A mechanism that the first dissociation of some freely moveable excitons at the interface was followed by transfer of liberated electrons over the junction barrier is proposed to interpret the appearance and development of the \u201cdip\u201d structure. The formation and evolution process of this \u201cdip\u201d structure can be well resolved from the measured time-resolved PL spectra.

However, the literature reported synthetic methods until now were very time-consuming. In this study, we establish a quick and facile method for obtaining self-doping TiO2 with the use of directly treated commercial P25 at a desired temperature for only 5 min through spark plasma sintering technology. With the using of this method, the modified P25 samples exhibit significantly high photoelectric and photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the sample prepared at 600°C exhibits the optimum catalytic activity. The photodegradation and H2 evolution rates of this samples are significantly higher than those of unmodified P25 sample under visible-light irradiation. The physical origin of the visible-light absorption for the modified P25 samples is investigated in detail according to their structural, optical, and electronic properties.

        "text": "Growth through controlled adsorption of ferromagnetic elements such as Fe, Co and Ni on two-dimensional silicene provides an alternative route for silicon-based spintronics. Plane wave DFT calculations show that Fe, Co and Ni adatoms are strongly chemisorbed via strong sigma bonds, with adsorption energies (1.55 - 2.29 eV) that are two to six times greater compared to adsorption on graphene. All adatoms adsorb more strongly at the hole site than at the atom site, with Ni adsorbing strongest. Of the dimer configurations investigated, the hole \u2013 hole, b-atom \u2013 hole, vertically stacked at hole, vertically stacked at b-atom and bridge sites were found to be stable. The Co and Ni dimers are most stable when adsorbed in the hole-hole configuration while the Fe dimer is most stable when adsorbed in the atom-hole configuration. Metal-to-silicene and interconfigurational s-to-d electron transfer processes underpin the trends observed in adsorption energies and magnetic moments for both adatoms and dimers. Adsorption of these metals induces a small band gap at the Dirac Cone. In particular Co adatom adsorption at the hole site induces the largest spin-polarized band gaps of 0.70 eV (spin-up) and 0.28 eV (spin-down) making it a potential material candidate for spintronics applications. Subject terms: Electronic devices\u2022 Spintronics At a glance Figures View all figures Figure 1: Representations of silicene up and down atoms relative to adsorption plane of metal adatoms (represented generically in blue here). There are just two adsorption sites that are stable: (i) metal adatom at the hole site and (ii) metal adatom adsorbed above the b-site. In (i), the metal adatom has a coordination number of 6 with two sets of bond lengths, ra and rb, respectively to a-type and b-type Si atoms. In (ii), the metal adatom has a coordination number of 4 (see Figure inset) with just one set of bond lengths. Fe, Co and Ni adatoms absorb more strongly at the hole site compared to the b-site.

All a-h and a-a* dimers, just like the corresponding adatom adsorption configuration, became b-h and b-b* dimers respectively.

        "text": "The possibility that non-magnetic materials such as carbon could exhibit a novel type of s\u2013p electron magnetism has attracted much attention over the years, not least because such magnetic order is predicted to be stable at high temperatures1. It has been demonstrated that atomic-scale structural defects of graphene can host unpaired spins2, 3, but it remains unclear under what conditions long-range magnetic order can emerge from such defect-bound magnetic moments. Here we propose that, in contrast to random defect distributions, atomic-scale engineering of graphene edges with specific crystallographic orientation\u2014comprising edge atoms from only one sub-lattice of the bipartite graphene lattice\u2014can give rise to a robust magnetic order. We use a nanofabrication technique4 based on scanning tunnelling microscopy to define graphene nanoribbons with nanometre precision and well-defined crystallographic edge orientations. Although so-called \u2018armchair\u2019 ribbons display quantum confinement gaps, ribbons with the \u2018zigzag\u2019 edge structure that are narrower than 7 nanometres exhibit an electronic bandgap of about 0.2\u20130.3 electronvolts, which can be identified as a signature of interaction-induced spin ordering along their edges. Moreover, upon increasing the ribbon width, a semiconductor-to-metal transition is revealed, indicating the switching of the magnetic coupling between opposite ribbon edges from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic configuration. We found that the magnetic order on graphene edges of controlled zigzag orientation can be stable even at room temperature, raising hopes of graphene-based spintronic devices operating under ambient conditions. Subject terms: Electronic properties and devices\u2022 Magnetic properties and materials At a glance Figures Figure 1: Fabrication of graphene nanoribbons with precisely defined crystallographic edge orientations. STM image (500 mV, 0.8 nA) of a 5-nm-wide graphene nanoribbon with armchair edge orientation (a) and STM image of a 6.5-nm-wide ribbon with edges of precisely zigzag orientation (300 mV, 2 nA) (b) patterned by scanning tunnelling lithography in a graphene sheet deposited on a Au(111) substrate. The circular insets show atomic-resolution STM images, confirming the crystallographic directions of the edges. The atomic-resolution images in the insets were Fourier filtered for clarity. The protrusions on the otherwise highly regular edges are imaging instabilities. Figure 2: Edge-specific electronic and magnetic properties of graphene nanoribbons. The bandgap measured by tunnelling spectroscopy as a function of ribbon width in armchair (a) and zigzag (b) ribbons. Armchair ribbons display a quantum confinement gap inversely proportional to their width (where n = 1, 2, 3,...; see main text). In zigzag ribbons the band structure is governed by the emerging edge magnetism and a sharp semiconductor (antiferromagnetic) to metal (ferromagnetic) transition is revealed. Theoretical data points were calculated using the mean field Hubbard model (continuous lines are only guides to the eye). Error bars of the measured gap values originate from thermal broadening and substrate effects; error bars for ribbon widths (horizontal) arise from tip convolution effects.

Spin density distribution (↑, blue; ↓, red) in 5-nm-wide (left) and 10-nm-wide (right) zigzag graphene nanoribbons calculated in the mean field Hubbard model for T = 300 K and ΔEF ≈ 100 meV. The lower panels display the corresponding band structure, clearly indicating that narrow zigzag ribbons are antiferromagnetic semiconductors, whereas the wider (>8 nm) zigzag ribbons display a ferromagnetic inter-edge coupling and no bandgap. ka is wavenumber times the lattice constant. Extended Data Fig. 1: The structure of graphene edges defined by STM lithography. a, STM image (5 mV, 2 nA) of 15-nm-long edge segments cut by STM lithography, revealing edges that are close to atomically smooth (b, The increased local density of states on zigzag edges observed under specific imaging conditions (200 mV, 2 nA) can be attributed to the presence of edge states that rule out the possibility of sp3-type edge terminations (for example, di-hydrogenated edges), because no edge states are expected to occur for such edge configurations. Extended Data Fig. 2: Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy of graphene nanoribbons on Au (111). Tunnelling I\u2013V characteristics acquired on a 5-nm-wide armchair ribbon (a) displaying nonlinear I\u2013V spectra corresponding to a gap of about 250 meV (b). Outside the ribbon a close-to-linear characteristic of the unpatterned graphene is revealed (c). The blue triangle and yellow square mark the positions of the corresponding tunnelling spectra. The insets show the schematics of STM lithography (a), and the differential tunnelling conductance (dI/dV) obtained as numerical derivatives of the measured I\u2013V curves (b and c). The ~70-mV shift of the Dirac point (curve minimum) from the Fermi level (zero bias) observed on graphene (inset to c) is due to the doping from the Au(111) substrate and the ambient atmosphere. Extended Data Fig. 3: The effect of edge irregularities on edge magnetism. Calculated spin density distribution in the unit cell of a 3.3-nm-wide zigzag ribbon with a high density of atomic-scale defects, revealing the substantial decrease of the emerging spin polarization (to about a third of that of defect-free zigzag edges). The experimental width dependence can be fitted for defective ribbon edges by using higher values of the on-site repulsion parameter of U = 4.32 eV. Extended Data Fig. 4: Individual tunnelling I\u2013V spectra. Tunnelling I\u2013V characteristics recorded on various ribbons (the spectra have been shifted along the vertical axis for clarity). Each individual spectrum was recorded as the average of ten voltage sweeps between −500 mV and +500 mV. The metallic (close to linear) or semiconducting (strongly nonlinear) nature of the ribbons is clearly apparent from the individual tunnelling I\u2013V characteristics.

        "text": "Wave control in the solid state has opened new avenues in modern information technology. Surface-acoustic-wave-based devices are found as mass market products in 100 millions of cellular phones. Spin waves (magnons) would offer a boost in today's data handling and security implementations, i.e., image processing and speech recognition. However, nanomagnonic devices realized so far suffer from the relatively short damping length in the metallic ferromagnets amounting to a few 10 micrometers typically. Here we demonstrate that nm-thick YIG films overcome the damping chasm. Using a conventional coplanar waveguide we excite a large series of short-wavelength spin waves (SWs). From the data we estimate a macroscopic of damping length of about 600 micrometers. The intrinsic damping parameter suggests even a record value about 1 mm allowing for magnonics-based nanotechnology with ultra-low damping. In addition, SWs at large wave vector are found to exhibit the non-reciprocal properties relevant for new concepts in nanoscale SW-based logics. We expect our results to provide the basis for coherent data processing with SWs at GHz rates and in large arrays of cellular magnetic arrays, thereby boosting the envisioned image processing and speech recognition.

However, contrary to earlier experimental reports, we found both experimentally and theoretically that the easy magnetic axis lies in the hexagonal plane, which is undesirable for a permanent magnet material. One possibility for changing the easy axis direction is through alloying. We used first principles calculations to investigate the effect of elemental substitutions. The calculations showed that substitution on the Sn site has the potential to switch the easy axis direction. However, transition metal substitutions with Co or Mn do not have this effect. We attempted synthesis of a number of these alloys and found results in accord with the theoretical predictions for those that were formed. However, the alloys that could be readily made all showed an in-plane easy axis.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information The search for therapeutic agents that bind specifically to precursor protein conformations and inhibit amyloid assembly is an important challenge. Identifying such inhibitors is difficult because many protein precursors of aggregation are partially folded or intrinsically disordered, which rules out structure-based design. Furthermore, inhibitors can act by a variety of mechanisms, including specific or nonspecific binding, as well as colloidal inhibition. Here we report a high-throughput method based on ion mobility spectrometry\u2013mass spectrometry (IMS\u2013MS) that is capable of rapidly detecting small molecules that bind to amyloid precursors, identifying the interacting protein species and defining the mode of inhibition. Using this method we have classified a variety of small molecules that are potential inhibitors of human \u200bislet amyloid polypeptide (\u200bhIAPP) aggregation or \u200bamyloid-beta 1-40 aggregation as specific, nonspecific, colloidal or non-interacting. We also demonstrate the ability of IMS\u2013MS to screen for inhibitory small molecules in a 96-well plate format and use this to discover a new inhibitor of \u200bhIAPP amyloid assembly.

The method is based on exchange of energy levels between fluorescent molecules by the FRET phenomenon which intrinsically provides a virtual nanocommunication link. In this work, further to the extensive theoretical studies, we demonstrate the first information transfer through a FRET-based nanocommunication channel. We implement a digital communication system combining macroscale transceiver instruments and a bulk solution of fluorophore nanoantennas. The performance of the FRET-based Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO) nanocommunication channel between closely located mobile nanoantennas in the sample solution is evaluated in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Bit Error Rate (BER) obtained for the transmission rates of 50 kbps, 150 kbps and 250 kbps.

        "text": "Gauge theory plays the central role in modern physics. Here we propose a scheme of implementing artificial Abelian gauge fields via the parametric conversion method in a necklace of superconducting transmission line resonators (TLRs) coupled by superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). The motivation is to synthesize an extremely strong effective magnetic field for charge-neutral bosons which can hardly be achieved in conventional solid-state systems. The dynamic modulations of the SQUIDs can induce effective magnetic fields for the microwave photons in the TLR necklace through the generation of the nontrivial hopping phases of the photon hopping between neighboring TLRs. To demonstrate the synthetic magnetic field, we study the realization and detection of the chiral photon flow dynamics in this architecture under the influence of decoherence. Taking the advantages of its simplicity and flexibility, this parametric scheme is feasible with state-of-the-art technology and may pave an alternative way for investigating the gauge theories with superconducting quantum circuits. We further propose a quantitative measure for the chiral property of the photon flow. Beyond the level of qualitative description, the dependence of the chiral flow on external pumping parameters and cavity decay is characterized. Subject terms: Quantum optics\u2022 Single photons and quantum effects\u2022 Quantum simulation At a glance Figures View all figures Figure 1: (a) Schematic plot of the SQUID-coupled three-TLR necklace. This circuit is constructed by three TLRs connected through the grounding SQUIDs. For each SQUID α, the SQUID loop is penetrated by a static bias flux and a dynamic modulation pulse δΦα with α = a, b, c. Moreover, each TLR is coupled to a measurement device which can detect its photon number. The lowest three eigenfrequencies of the circuit are labeled by ω1, ω2, and ω3, respectively. (b), (c) The localization property of the eigenmodes. (c) depicts the normalized mode functions of the three lowest eigenmodes of the circuit QED necklace versus critical currents of the SQUIDs. The three panels of (c) describe the eigenmode functions corresponding to the eigenmode 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The blue solid line, green dash line and red dot-dashed line correspond to the situations of IS = Ia = Ib = Ic = 1, 2, 3 μA respectively. In addition, we set EJα/ECα = 100 with ECα = 2e2/CJα. With the chosen parameters, we get ω1/2π = 11.5 GHz, ω2/2π = 9.5 GHz and ω3/2π = 8.2 GHz for IS = 3 μA. In (b), we quantify the localization property of the mth eigenmode by Em/ωm where Em is the energy stored in the mth TLR for m = 1, 2, 3. The critical current IS of the SQUIDs varies from 0.5 μA to 4 μA, and the other parameters are chosen as the same as in Fig. 1(c). (d) Square lattice consisting of four kinds of TLRs. Four kinds of TLRs with different eigenfrequencies (red for ω1/2π = 8 GHz, orange for ω2/2π = 9 GHz, blue for ω3/2π = 10 GHz and dark blue for ω4/2π = 11 GHz) are placed in an interlaced form and coupled by grounding SQUIDs. With proper pumping pulses, only nearest-neighbor parametric photon hopping can be induced. Full size image View in article Figure 2: Chiral photon flow in the TLR necklace in the presence of decay. The three panels from top to bottom represent the three situations θΣ = π/2, π, and 3π/2, respectively. The solid (blue), dashed (green), and dot-dashed (red) lines represent the energies stored in the TLR 1, 2 and 3, respectively. For the three grounding SQUIDs we assume that they have identical maximal critical current 5 μA and identical static flux bias . The amplitudes of the pumping pulses are chosen as ΔΦa/b/c/Φ0 = 1.4/2.0/1.4% such that the homogeneous coupling strength gT/2π = ga/2π = gb/2π = gc/2π = 20 MHz is induced.

        "text": "Domain walls in ferroic materials have attracted significant interest in recent years, in particular because of the unique properties that can be found in their vicinity1, 2, 3. However, to fully harness their potential as nanoscale functional entities4, 5, it is essential to achieve reliable and precise control of their nucleation, location, number and velocity. Here, using piezoresponse force microscopy, we show the control and manipulation of domain walls in ferroelectric thin films of Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 with Pt top electrodes. This high-level control presents an excellent opportunity to demonstrate the versatility and flexibility of ferroelectric domain walls. Their position can be controlled by the tuning of voltage pulses, and multiple domain walls can be nucleated and handled in a reproducible fashion. The system is accurately described by analogy to the classical Stefan problem6, which has been used previously to describe many diverse systems and is here applied to electric circuits. This study is a step towards the realization of domain wall nanoelectronics utilizing ferroelectric thin films.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information Colloidal quantum dots, viruses, DNA and all other nanoparticles have acoustic vibrations that can act as \u2018fingerprints\u2019 to identify their shape, size and mechanical properties, yet high-resolution Raman spectroscopy in this low-energy range has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate extraordinary acoustic Raman (EAR) spectroscopy to measure the Raman-active vibrations of single isolated nanoparticles in the 0.1\u201310 cm−1 range with ∼0.05 cm−1 resolution, to resolve peak splitting from material anisotropy and to probe the low-frequency modes of biomolecules. EAR employs a nanoaperture laser tweezer that can select particles of interest and manipulate them once identified. We therefore believe that this nanotechnology will enable expanded capabilities for the study of nanoparticles in the materials and life sciences. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Working principle of the DNH\u2013EAR experiment. Red and blue sources represent the two lasers. Their interaction will produce a beat signal (shown in green and enveloped in red). This beat signal will modulate the electrostriction force at the trapping site, causing vibrations in the particle. The solid blue circle shows the equilibrium position and dashed lines show example deformations.

        "text": "Of the many materials and methodologies aimed at producing low-cost, efficient photovoltaic cells, inorganic\u2013organic lead halide perovskite materials1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 appear particularly promising for next-generation solar devices owing to their high power conversion efficiency. The highest efficiencies reported for perovskite solar cells so far have been obtained mainly with methylammonium lead halide materials1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Here we combine the promising\u2014owing to its comparatively narrow bandgap\u2014but relatively unstable formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) with methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) as the light-harvesting unit in a bilayer solar-cell architecture13. We investigated phase stability, morphology of the perovskite layer, hysteresis in current\u2013voltage characteristics, and overall performance as a function of chemical composition. Our results show that incorporation of MAPbBr3 into FAPbI3 stabilizes the perovskite phase of FAPbI3 and improves the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell to more than 18 per cent under a standard illumination of 100 milliwatts per square centimetre. These findings further emphasize the versatility and performance potential of inorganic\u2013organic lead halide perovskite materials for photovoltaic applications.

        "text": "Authors reported an effective path to decrease the thermal conductivity while to increase the coefficient of thermal expansion, thus enhancing the thermo-physical properties of the LnMeA11O19-type magnetoplumbite LaMgAl11O19 by simultaneously substituting La3+, Mg2+ and Al3+ ions with large ionic radius Ba2+, Zn2+ and Ti4+, respectively. The mechanism behind the lowered thermal conductivity was mainly due to the multi-enhanced-phonon scattering modes in Ln-Me-A sites co-substituted LnMeA11O19 ceramics. These modes involve the following four aspects, namely, point defect mechanism, the intrinsic scattering in the complex crystal cell and materials with stepped surface to localize phonon vibrational modes, as well as nano-platelet-like structure to incorporate additional grain boundary scattering.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information Although Li-rich layered oxides (Li1+xNiyCozMn1−x−y−zO2 > 250 mAh g−1) are attractive electrode materials providing energy densities more than 15% higher than today\u2019s commercial Li-ion cells, they suffer from voltage decay on cycling. To elucidate the origin of this phenomenon, we employ chemical substitution in structurally related Li2RuO3 compounds. Li-rich layered Li2Ru1−yTiyO3 phases with capacities of ~240 mAh g−1 exhibit the characteristic voltage decay on cycling. A combination of transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies reveals that the migration of cations between metal layers and Li layers is an intrinsic feature of the charge\u2013discharge process that increases the trapping of metal ions in interstitial tetrahedral sites. A correlation between these trapped ions and the voltage decay is established by expanding the study to both Li2Ru1−ySnyO3 and Li2RuO3; the slowest decay occurs for the cations with the largest ionic radii. This effect is robust, and the finding provides insights into new chemistry to be explored for developing high-capacity layered electrodes that evade voltage decay. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Structural and electrochemical aspects of Li2Ru0.75Ti0.25O3. a, Powder XRD pattern (black points) and the Rietveld fit (red lines) for Li2Ru0.75Ti0.25O3; refinement was carried out using the monoclinic C2/m space group (lattice parameters: a = 5.037(7) Å,b = 8.717(1) Å,c = 5.126(6) Å and β = 109.137(3)°). Bragg positions are indicated as green vertical tick marks, and the blue line is the difference between the observed and calculated patterns. RBragg = 7.88%. The peaks marked by stars are the reflections originating from the difference in scattering density between octahedral positions in the Li3 and LiM2 layers (interlayer ordering) and can serve as a means to estimate the interlayer mixing, that is, the amount of transition-metal atoms (Ru/Ti) moving from the octahedral sites of the LiM2 layers (denoted OcM) to the octahedral sites of the Li3 layers (denoted OcLi). The inset shows the structure of Li2Ru0.75Ti0.25O3 with stacking of LiM2 (M = Ru, Ti) and Li3 layers; Li is yellow, Ru/Ti is blue, possible tetrahedral sites for the occupation of metal ions are shown by green (in the Li3 and LiM2 layer) tetrahedra. b, Voltage versus composition profile for Li2Ru0.75Ti0.25O3 versus \u200blithium as deduced from galvanostatic cycling at a 0.2 C rate. c, Percentage capacity retention plot of Li2Ru0.75Ti0.25O3 in comparison with that of Li2RuO3 and Li2Ru0.75Sn0.25O3; the as-measured capacities are presented in the inset. d, From cycle 1 to 100, the galvanostatic discharge profile of Li2Ru0.75Ti0.25O3 versus \u200bLi in the 2\u20134.6 V potential region; every tenth cycle is shown and the capacity values were normalized such that the maximum capacity in each cycle is taken as unity (240 and 151 mAh g−1 is taken as unity for the first and hundredth cycles, respectively). The inset shows the derivative plot of the same, and the evolution of the new redox process at less than 3 V is marked by blue arrow.

The capacity retention for Li2Ru0.5Sn0.5O3 and Li2Ru0.25Sn0.75O3 samples is shown in the inset in c. The capacity normalization was performed by taking the maximum discharge capacity in the corresponding cycle as unity.

On charging the \u200bLi/Li2−xRu0.75Ti0.25O3 cell to 4 V, there is a shift in the (003)R peak towards higher 2θ and merging of (006)R and (102)R Bragg peaks (indexed in ) indicating an anisotropic variation of lattice parameters with the removal of lithium. On discharge, most of the peaks regained their intensity and reappearance of (006)R and (102)R peak splitting shows that the structure converts back to the pristine layered ordered structure. b, Synchrotron powder XRD pattern of pristine Li2Ru0.75Ti0.25O3 and samples collected at the discharged state (2 V) after 1 and 50 cycles. c, Variation of the Lorentzian broadening parameter X∗tanθ with cycling derived from refinement of the synchrotron XRD patterns.

The O 1s core spectrum consists of two peaks corresponding to crystalline O2− (529.5 eV) and surface oxidized species (531.6 eV). The new component appearing at 530.5 eV for the sample charged to 4.6 V is due to peroxo-like species associated with anion contribution for the redox process. Ti 2p3/2 spectra, as a function of the cell voltage, are shown in the second panel from the right to highlight the partial migration of Ti4+ from the octahedral site together with its partial reduction on discharge. The right panel shows the evolution of the Ti 2p3/2 spectra with increasing number of cycles (1, 30 and 50 cycles).

The insets show (from top to bottom): HAADF-STEM image of the atomic columns in the LiM2 layer of the pristine Li2Ru0.75Ti0.25O3 sample along with the corresponding intensity profile demonstrating pair of dots separated by ~0.14 nm (this corresponds to perfect honeycomb ordering of the Li and M cations within the LiM2 layers); HAADF-STEM image of the atomic columns in the LiM2 layer of the charged Li2Ru0.75Ti0.25O3 sample along with the corresponding intensity profile demonstrating significant disorder of the M cations within the LiM2 layers; selected-area electron diffraction pattern of the charged Li2Ru0.75Ti0.25O3 sample showing lines of diffuse modulated intensity at the k ≠ 3n positions due to local remaining order of the M cations in the LiM2 layers. b\u2013d, Images and corresponding HAADF-STEM signal profiles illustrating the different stages of the cation migration. b, The pristine structure is mostly preserved, most of the (Ru, Ti) cations are in the octahedral OcM positions (blue peaks on the profiles), but a fraction of the (Ru, Ti) cations are moved to the tetrahedral interstices (green peaks on the profile marked with arrowheads). Occupation of the octahedral positions in the Li3 layer remains marginal (yellow peaks on the profile marked with asterisks). c, Occupation of the octahedral positions in the Li3 layer increases, some (Ru, Ti) cations remain at tetrahedral interstices. d, A large fraction of the (Ru, Ti) cations are moved to the octahedral position in the Li3 layer. For simplification, in the aforementioned description, the Li3 and LiM2 layers of the pristine structure are termed as Li3 and LiM2 although the cation composition of these layers is changed substantially owing to cation migration.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information Entanglement is a concept that has defied common sense since the discovery of quantum mechanics. Two particles are said to be entangled when the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently, no matter how far apart in space and time the two particles are. We demonstrate experimentally that unpaired spins separated by several hundred ångström entangle through a collection of spin singlets made up of antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chains in a bulk material. Low-temperature magnetization and specific heat studies as a function of magnetic field reveal the occurrence of very dilute spin dimers and at least two quantum phase transitions related to the breaking of excited local triplets. The mechanism at the origin of the unpaired spins inside the quantum chains is the inter-modulation potential between two sublattices, and may be replicated using well-designed synthetic multilayers. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Sketch of a quantum communication channel and properties of spins entangled through antiferromagnetic interactions. a, Spins SA and SB are entangled through a spin chain C of length L. Jp is the spin exchange between spins at SA and SB and the chain. HC is the Hamiltonian of the spin chains. b, Sketch of the variation of the energy gap, Δ, as a function of the length L in a log\u2013log plot. Δ is proportional to the effective spin exchange between SA and SB and to the spin exchange constant of HC renormalized by the length L (or the number of sites in L). As a result, SA and SB form an antiferromagnetic entangled state with a ground state (singlet) that is expressed as |SA↑SB↓ − |SA↓SB↑. c, The spin triplet splits on application of a magnetic field following the Zeeman relation: Δ(H) = Δ(0) ± gμBH for |SA↑SB↑ and |SA↓SB↓; Δ(H) = Δ(0) for |SA↑SB↓ + |SA↓SB↑. Figure 2: Detailed description of the structure and magnetic properties of the chain subsystem. a, Pattern of spin dimers and Zhang\u2013Rice singlets (representing an effective Cu3+) in the chain sublattice as deduced from inelastic neutron scattering14. Filled circles are Cu2+ with spin S = 1/2. Open circles are Zhang\u2013Rice singlets with a total spin S = 0, arising from the coupling between the spin of an extra-hole and a Cu2+S = 1/2. It is assumed that there are no holes in the ladder sublattice. It should be noted that all these spins dimers (either the Zhang\u2013Rice or the next-nearest neighbour Cu2+) are entangled states with a ground state represented by |S1↑S2↓ − |S1↓S2↑. b, Sr14Cu24O41 unit cell in the ac-plane, showing the chains sublattice. Included are the lattice parameters, and the magnetic exchange constants deduced from inelastic neutron scattering13, 14. c, Spin-dimer chains with single spins (in red), as proposed by ab initio calculations12. The effective spin exchange, Jeff, between isolated spins (separated by a distance L) is of the order of a few kelvin. Figure 3: Magnetization data at low temperature and under magnetic fields. a, Magnetization as a function of temperature for temperatures below 5 K. Two features are evident: a maximum at 1.3 K, which we interpret as arising from the formation of spin dimers between distant unpaired spins with a spin singlet-to-triplet gap of Δ1 ≈ 2.3 K (red point), and a rapid uprise below 1 K, which we interpret as being due to a small concentration of unpaired spins that remain free down to our lowest temperature. Dash and dash-dotted lines represent the fit with the corresponding equations (Supplementary Methods). b, Magnetic field dependence of the magnetization at the lowest measured temperature, 90 mK. Data were analysed with three components: a Brillouin function describing the magnetization of unpaired spins and two dimer contributions with the gap linearly depending on the magnetization (Zeeman effect). The gaps deduced for the two spin-1/2 dimers, following the Zeeman splitting (Δ = gμBHC/kB), are Δ1 ≈ 2.3 K and Δ2 ≈ 3.6 K. c, Magnetic field dependence of the magnetization for nine temperatures below 1 K for sample 1. d, Simulation of the data in c using the data analysis described in the Supplementary Methods. The simulation was performed by fitting the low-temperature data, then fixing the parameters and applying only the temperature variation of equations. Figure 4: Low-temperature specific heat experiments at different applied magnetic fields. a, Raw data at nominally 0 T and 0.2 T. Points are the experimental results and the dashed\u2013dotted line is the field-independent component extracted from the results at larger magnetic fields. b, Temperature dependence of the magnetic part of the low-temperature specific heat at three magnetic fields. The fit (solid line) was performed with two components. First, a Schottky component (dashed line), CP(θ, β) ≈ Nfs(θβ)2e−θβ/(1 + e−θβ)2, with θ = 2μBH/kB and β = 1/kBT, that accounts for the lowest temperature uprise. This component has no free parameters (Supplementary Methods) and the three magnetic field data were fitted simultaneously. The very small uprise at nominally H = 0 T is the signature of a small magnetic field present in our coil that we estimate to be 15 mT. Second, the hump was fitted by CP(β) ≈ (Δβ)1.5 exp(−Δβ) and Δ = 1.75 K. This is clearly an approximation, in view of the results of the magnetization experiment, where several components characterized by larger gaps are evident. Figure 5: Quantum correlations. Concurrence (red), entanglement (blue) and quantum information (green) correlations as a function of temperature. Data (in circles) are extracted from Fig. 3a, once the Curie tail has been subtracted. The calculations (solid lines) correspond to the spin-dimer model21, 42.

        "text": "Dynamically repeated periodic patterns are abundant in natural and artificial systems, such as tides, heart beats, stock prices, and the like. The characteristic repeatability and periodicity are expected to be optimized in effective system-specific functions. In this study, such optimum periodicity is experimentally evaluated in terms of effective mass transport using one-valve and multi-valve systems working in contractile fluid flows. A set of nanoscale gating functions is utilized, operating in nanocomposite networks through which permeates selectively pass under characteristic contractile actions. Optimized contractile periodicity exists for effective energy impartment to flow in a one-valve system. In the sequential contractile actions for a multi-valve system, synchronization with the fluid flow is critical for effective mass transport. This study provides fundamental understanding on the various repeated periodic patterns and dynamic repeatability occurring in nature and mechanical systems, which are useful for broad applications. Subject terms: Chemical engineering\u2022 Nanoparticles At a glance Figures View all figures Figure 1: (a) [I] TEM image of gold nanoparticle (AuNP) use for linterlinking.

[II] TEM, [III] X-ray nanoscopy (XN) and [IV] X-ray microscopy (XM). (b) Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) results of the designed AuNP-PEG nanocomposite in solution state in broad q ranges (two Sample-to-detector distance conditions are combined). A critical q value (marked by q*) exist from which temperature-responsiveness is diversified, indicating dual regions of the designed network: stable large-scale domain at low q and responsive small-scale domain at high q. Characteristic size is determined according to the temperature detected by q1 (60°C), q2 (40°C) and q3 (20°C). (c) Illustration of responsive network structures. Pore size variation of the nanocomposites in PVA matrix induced by the stimuli-responsive PEOs through which permeates are transported. [I] Swollen PEOs generates (or block) small path for permeate molecules. [II] Shrunken PEOs allow relatively wide pathway for effective permeate transport. The correlation lengths (ζ) are determined based on the pictures below. Bold lines denote stable connection, whereas dotted lines indicates flexibly responsive chains by the external stimuli. Full size image View in article Figure 2: (a) Experimental set-up for mass-transport. Permeate molecules of periodic injection (fin) are loaded with a controlled flow rate (r). (b) Temperature control (left) and molecular signal detection (right) are highly synchronized, indicating stably optimized system for mass transport investigation. (c) Retention time (Rt) during which the permeate molecules are stay in the cell before they are detected at the outlet. At a fixed r, the input frequency (fin) and output frequency (fout) are kept same. (d) Rt decreases linearly, whereas normalized frequency (fout/fin) maintains unity according to r. Full size image View in article Figure 3: (a) Representative result of f change according to the designed r (a, acceleration). [I] Input at a fixed f and designed r. [II] Output case I: fout increases with continuously increasing r. [III] Output case II: fout decreases with continuously decreasing r. (b) Graphical summary of the results obtained in (a). Without acceleration (a = 0), fout/fin maintains unity according to r. fout/fin linearly increases with positive a, but linearly decreases with negative a. These results exhibit typical particle-like behavior of permeate molecules under acceleration caused by increased r. Considering the fixed path-length of the system, the result reflects the linear mass-energy relation. Full size image View in article Figure 4: (a) Design of the contractile action on flow. By repeating on−off−on position, one valve function is designed (upper). Representative data of the one-valve system. During the designed off-time (toff), the inlet flow stops. During the taper time (ttaper), detection of permeate molecules slows followed by complete stop-time (tstop). Right after the toff starts, there is a responding time (tresponding) at which the flow stops suddenly and generates back pressure inside the cell. According to the inlet frequency (fin), the outlet frequency is modulated. Right after the toff, the first maximum outlet frequency is determined as recover frequency (frecover) after that ith frequency is determined in a sequence. (b) [I] toff vs. tresponding [II] toff vs. ttaper. tresponding and ttaper are independent of toff, reflecting system-specific features. [III] toff vs. maximum normalized frequency (frecover/fin). The frequency increase is saturated at a critical point, so the optimum time (toptinum) is determined. (c) toff vs. frecover/fin with changing r (left) and fin (right). The critical point move to higher toff by decreasing r, whereas a higher fin contributes to the increase in the magnitude of frecover/fin. (d) Fitting results of the trecover vs. toff in the two regions: [I] in the range of toff ≤ topt, K(r) toff + 1/fin relation is satisfied. [II] in the range of toff > topt, K(r) [toff + (toff − topt)] + 1/fin relation is applied. The proportional factor K is also a function of r. (e) Summary of one periodicity composed of toff and trecover as a function of toff, toptinum, frecover and fin. Full size image View in article Figure 5: (a) Schematic illustration of the multi-valve system of sequential contractile actions. The cell is divided into 10 units of individual temperature control. The time for each unit is designed to be same as t1 = t2 = t3\u2026\u2026. = t10. The temperature frequency (ftemp) is determined as inverse proportionality of the total time taking for one cycle. (b) Without ftemp introduction, the system exhibits stable (fout/fin) = 1. (c) With increased ftemp from 0 to 0.3 (min−1), the fout/fin increases proportionally to r2. However, fout/fin decreases significantly from ftemp = 0.4 min−1. Therefore, an optimum ftemp is necessary to maximize the fout/fin. Full size image View in article",

        "text": "The design principles for naturally occurring biological materials have inspired us to develop next-generation engineering materials with remarkable performance. Nacre, commonly referred to as nature's armor, is renowned for its unusual combination of strength and toughness. Nature's wisdom in nacre resides in its elaborate structural design and the judicious placement of a unique organic biopolymer with intelligent deformation features. However, up to now, it is still a challenge to transcribe the biopolymer's deformation attributes into a stronger substitute in the design of new materials. In this study, we propose a new design strategy that employs shape memory alloy to transcribe the \u201cJ-curve\u201d mechanical response and uniform molecular/atomic level deformation of the organic biopolymer in the design of high-performance hybrid materials. This design strategy is verified in a TiNi-Ti3Sn model material system. The model material demonstrates an exceptional combination of mechanical properties that are superior to other high-performance metal-based lamellar composites known to date. Our design strategy creates new opportunities for the development of high-performance bio-inspired materials.

        "text": "We explore the signatures of Majorana fermions in a nanowire based topological superconductor-quantum dot-topological superconductor hybrid device by charge transport measurements. At zero magnetic field, well-defined Coulomb diamonds and the Kondo effect are observed. Under the application of a finite, sufficiently strong magnetic field, a zero-bias conductance peak structure is observed. It is found that the zero-bias conductance peak is present in many consecutive Coulomb diamonds, irrespective of the even-odd parity of the quasi-particle occupation number in the quantum dot. In addition, we find that the zero-bias conductance peak is in most cases accompanied by two differential conductance peaks, forming a triple-peak structure, and the separation between the two side peaks in bias voltage shows oscillations closely correlated to the background Coulomb conductance oscillations of the device. The observed zero-bias conductance peak and the associated triple-peak structure are in line with Majorana fermion physics in such a hybrid topological system.

(b) and (c) Corresponding differential conductance line-cut plots of the measurements at a series of values of Vbg. The plots shown in panel (b) are the differential conductance measurements at Vbg ranging from 5.15 V to 5.4 V, while the plots shown in panel (c) are that at Vbg ranging from 5.4 V to 5.835 V. For clarity, these line-cut plots are shifted in such a way that values of the differential conductance at Vsd = 0 μV in these line cuts are successively placed 0.005 e2/h higher than the values of their adjacent, lower gate-voltage line cuts, while their actual zero-bias conductance values are represented by their gray-scale colors. Here, in (b) and (c), the existence of a ZBCP structure in every Coulomb blockade diamond is more clearly displayed. An overall low differential conductance gap (with its two edges indicated by two arrows on top of each panel) in the low bias voltage region due to the presence of the proximity effect induced InSb superconducting energy gap and its weak dependence on Vbg can also be identified in (b) and (c). In addition, a few line cuts are highlighted by thicker lines in (b) and (c) in order to help the reader to see the characteristic features in the plots. Full size image View in article Figure 3: (a) Differential conductance as a function of the source-drain bias voltage Vsd and the perpendicularly applied magnetic field B measured for the device at Vbg = 5.29 V, i.e., along the dashed line B in figure 1g. (b) The same as (a) but measured for the device at Vbg = 5.48 V, i.e., along the dashed line C in figure 1g. (c) Line-cut plots of the differential conductance measurements in the bias voltage and magnetic field region indicated by the white dashed rectangle in (a). (d) Line-cut plots of differential conductance measurements in the bias voltage and magnetic field region indicated by the white dashed rectangle in (b). For clarity, these line-cuts are shifted in the same way as in figures 2b and 2c, i.e., in such a way that values of the differential conductance at Vsd = 0 μV in these line cuts are placed successively 0.005 e2/h higher than the values of their adjacent, lower magnetic field line cuts, while their actual zero-bias conductance values are represented by their gray-scale colors. The ZBCP in panels (a) and (c) is seen to emerge at B ~ 0.6 T and disappear at B ~ 1.8 T, while the ZBCP in panels (b) and (d) is seen to emerge at B ~ 0.75 T and disappear B ~ 2.1 T. Panels (c) and (d) also show an overall low differential conductance gap in the low bias voltage region due to the presence of the proximity effect induced InSb superconducting energy gap and its evolution with increasing magnetic field. A few line cuts are highlighted by thicker lines in (b) and (c) in order to help the reader to identify the characteristic features in the plots.

Blue circles are the experimental data, red dashed lines are the Gaussian fits to the ZBCPs, blue dashed lines are the Gaussian fits to the side peaks, and black solid lines are the overall fitting results to the experimental data obtained by the sum of the Gaussian fits to the ZBCP and to the side peaks. (d) Separation (red circles) of the two side peaks Vsp1, as defined in panel (a), extracted from figures 2b and 2c as a function of Vbg. The solid line in the panel shows the differential conductance dIsd/dVsd measured for the device at Vsd = 100 μV. Here, it is seen that the Vsp1 oscillations and the differential conductance oscillations are closely correlated. (e) Value of Vsp1 (red circles) extracted from figure 3c as a function of B plotted together with the differential conductance (solid line) measured for the device at Vsd = 100 μV. (f)\u2013(h) Differential conductance as a function of Vsd measured at B = 1.2 T for the device at Vbg = 5.765 V, 5.815 V and 5.835 V, respectively. Here the ZBCP is seen to split into two peaks. Again, blue circles are the experimental data and blue dashed lines are the Gaussian fits to the side peaks. But red dashed lines are the Gaussian fits to the split peaks from the ZBCP. Black solid lines are the overall fitting results to the experimental data obtained by the sum of the Gaussian fits to the peaks split from the ZBCP and to the side peaks. (i) Splitting of the ZBCP Vsp2 (red circles), as defined in panel (f), extracted from figures 2b and 2c as a function of Vbg and the differential conductance (solid line) measured for the device at Vsd = 100 μV.

Here we demonstrate the coupling of microfluidics with small angle neutron scattering (SANS). Microdevices with high neutron transmission (up to 98%), low scattering background ( ), broad solvent compatibility and high pressure tolerance (≈3\u201315 bar) are rapidly prototyped via frontal photo polymerisation. Scattering from single microchannels of widths down to 60 μm, with beam footprint of 500 μm diameter, was successfully obtained in the scattering vector range 0.01\u20130.3 Å−1, corresponding to real space dimensions of . We demonstrate our approach by investigating the molecular re-orientation and alignment underpinning the flow response of two model complex fluids, namely cetyl trimethylammonium chloride/pentanol/D2O and sodium lauryl sulfate/octanol/brine lamellar systems.

Lack of sufficient structural detail has impeded understanding of RyR gating and regulation. Here we report the closed-state structure of the 2.3-megadalton complex of the rabbit skeletal muscle type 1 RyR (RyR1), solved by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy at an overall resolution of 4.8 Å. We fitted a polyalanine-level model to all 3,757 ordered residues in each protomer, defining the transmembrane pore in unprecedented detail and placing all cytosolic domains as tertiary folds. The cytosolic assembly is built on an extended α-solenoid scaffold connecting key regulatory domains to the pore. The RyR1 pore architecture places it in the six-transmembrane ion channel superfamily. A unique domain inserted between the second and third transmembrane helices interacts intimately with paired EF-hands originating from the α-solenoid scaffold, suggesting a mechanism for channel gating by Ca2+.

        "text": "There have been many interests in exploring multiferroic materials with superior ferroelectric and magnetic properties for the purpose of developing multifunctional devices. Fabrication of thin films plays an important role in achieving this purpose, since the multiferroicity can be tuned via strain, dimensionality, and size effect, without varying the chemical composition. Here, we report exotic multiferroic behaviors, including high-TC (~75 K) ferroelectric state, a large spontaneous polarization (~4900 μC/m2) and relatively strong ferromagnetism emerging at ~105 K, in orthorhombic GdMnO3/SrTiO3 (001) thin films with self-assembled nano-scale twin-like domains. We propose a possible ab-plane spiral-spin-order phase to be responsible for the large spontaneous polarization in the films, which can only be stabilized by relatively high magnetic field H > 6 T in the bulk crystals. It is suggested that the nano-scale twin-like domain structure is essential for the high temperature ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism of the thin films.

        "text": "Controlling the angular momentum of spins with very short external perturbations is a key issue in modern magnetism. For example it allows manipulating the magnetization for recording purposes or for inducing high frequency spin torque oscillations. Towards that purpose it is essential to modify and control the angular momentum of the magnetization which precesses around the resultant effective magnetic field. That can be achieved with very short external magnetic field pulses or using intrinsically coupled magnetic structures, resulting in a transfer of spin torque. Here we show that using picosecond acoustic pulses is a versatile and efficient way of controlling the spin angular momentum in ferromagnets. Two or three acoustic pulses, generated by femtosecond laser pulses, allow suppressing or enhancing the magnetic precession at any arbitrary time by precisely controlling the delays and amplitudes of the optical pulses. A formal analogy with a two dimensional pendulum allows us explaining the complex trajectory of the magnetic vector perturbed by the acoustic pulses.

        "text": "Mechanical metamaterials are artificial structures with unusual properties, such as negative Poisson ratio, bistability or tunable vibrational properties, that originate in the geometry of their unit cell1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Often at the heart of such unusual behaviour is a soft mode: a motion that does not significantly stretch or compress the links between constituent elements. When activated by motors or external fields, soft modes become the building blocks of robots and smart materials. Here, we demonstrate the existence of topological soft modes that can be positioned at desired locations in a metamaterial while being robust against a wide range of structural deformations or changes in material parameters6, 7, 8, 9, 10. These protected modes, localized at dislocations in deformed kagome and square lattices, are the mechanical analogue of topological states bound to defects in electronic systems11, 12, 13, 14. We create physical realizations of the topological modes in prototypes of kagome lattices built out of rigid triangular plates. We show mathematically that they originate from the interplay between two Berry phases: the Burgers vector of the dislocation and the topological polarization of the lattice. Our work paves the way towards engineering topologically protected nanomechanical structures for molecular robotics or information storage and read-out. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Dislocations in polarized isostatic lattices. a, Hexagonal lattice with primitive vectors {a1, a2}. The lattice includes an elementary dislocation, consisting of a five-coordinated point (green) connected to a seven-coordinated point (orange) in an otherwise six-coordinated lattice (blue points). The Burgers vector b = −a2 is the deficit in a circuit (black dashed line) that would have been closed in a defect-free lattice. Rotating this vector by π/2 gives the corresponding dipole moment vector d, which connects the five-coordinated point to the seven-coordinated point. Decorating each unit cell with a three-atom basis (yellow points and magenta bonds) produces a dislocated deformed kagome lattice which contains only four-coordinated points. Three copies of the three-atom basis are shown; solid bonds connect points within the same unit cell, whereas dashed bonds connect points belonging to different cells. b, Deformed kagome lattice obtained by decorating the triangular lattice in a, thus incorporating a dislocation with the same dipole moment d. The five- and seven-coordinated points in the underlying triangular lattice translate into plaquettes bordered by five (green) and seven (orange) bonds, respectively, whereas all other points in the triangular lattice translate to plaquettes bordered by six bonds (blue) in the decorated lattice. The topological polarization PT = a1, calculated in ref. 6, is also shown. c, Square lattice with primitive vectors {a1, a2} (black arrows) which incorporates a dislocation, consisting of a three-coordinated plaquette (bordered by green bonds) adjacent to a five-coordinated plaquette (bordered by orange and green bonds), with Burgers vector b = −(a1 + a2). The associated dipole moment d connects the three- and five-coordinated plaquettes. d, Decorating each point in c with the four-point unit cell (yellow points and magenta bonds) gives a distorted square lattice which incorporates a dislocation of the same dipole moment, and has a non-zero topological polarization PT = a1 − a2. Figure 2: Mechanical modes localized at defects. a, Visualization in a deformed kagome lattice of a numerically obtained low-energy soft mode (red arrows, showing the direction, with lengths and thicknesses scaled by the relative amplitude of allowed displacements) and an approximate state of self-stress (thickened bonds, showing bond forces in magenta (+) and blue (−) that cancel each other) associated with a pair of dislocations with equal and opposite dipole moments dL and dR (dashed arrows). The dislocations are in the interior of a lattice with periodic boundary conditions that is perfectly isostatic. Only a small region of the lattice is shown. Each dislocation consists of a five-coordinated plaquette (enclosed by green triangles) adjacent to a seven-coordinated plaquette (enclosed by green and orange triangles). b, Section of a deformed square lattice of a numerically obtained low-energy soft mode and a state of self-stress associated with a pair of dislocations with equal and opposite dipole moments dL and dR. The visualization method is similar to that in a. The dislocations are in the interior of a lattice with periodic boundary conditions that is perfectly isostatic. Each dislocation consists of a three-coordinated plaquette (enclosed by cyan plaquettes) near a five-coordinated plaquette (enclosed by cyan and yellow plaquettes). All other plaquettes are four-sided. c, Plastic prototype of a deformed kagome network, built as described in the text. The interior contains two dislocations which reproduce the configuration from the computer model shown in a. Scale bar, 5 cm. Inset: superposition of three configurations that span the range of the free motion associated with the left dislocation.

Inset: soft mode amplitude as a function of distance from the left dislocation, along two directions (indicated by red and green circles in the main panel which enclose the lattice points sampled in the red and green curves, respectively). b, Same as in a for the soft mode associated with the left dislocation shown in Fig. 2b.

        "text": "In polymer\u2013colloid mixtures1, 2, non-adsorbing polymers dispersed with much larger colloids provide a universal yet specific entropic attraction between the colloids3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Such so-called depletion interaction2, 3 arises from an osmotic-pressure imbalance caused by the polymers and is considered to be independent of temperature. Here we show that, for the most commonly used polymer\u2013colloid depletion systems5, 6, the polymer undergoes a crossover from non-adsorbing to adsorbing9 and that, consequently, the effective colloidal interactions depend on temperature. We also find that a combination of the enthalpic (polymer bridging10, 11, 12) and entropic (polymer exclusion2, 3, 4) interactions, both attractive, leads to a re-entrant regime where the colloids are dispersed and form solids both on heating and on cooling. We provide a simple model to explain the observed transitions and to fill the theoretical gap at the polymer-adsorption crossover2, 9. Our findings open possibilities for colloidal self-assembly5, 13, the formation of colloidal crystals14, 15 and glasses16, and the behaviour of temperature-controlled viscoelastic materials.

        "text": "Plasmonic nanostructures can significantly advance broadband visible-light absorption, with absorber thicknesses in the sub-wavelength regime, much thinner than conventional broadband coatings. Such absorbers have inherently very small heat capacity, hence a very rapid response time, and high light power-to-temperature sensitivity. Additionally, their surface emissivity can be spectrally tuned to suppress infrared thermal radiation. These capabilities make plasmonic absorbers promising candidates for fast light-to-heat applications, such as radiation sensors. Here we investigate the light-to-heat conversion properties of a metal-insulator-metal broadband plasmonic absorber, fabricated as a free-standing membrane. Using a fast IR camera, we show that the transient response of the absorber has a characteristic time below 13 ms, nearly one order of magnitude lower than a similar membrane coated with a commercial black spray. Concurrently, despite the small thickness, due to the large absorption capability, the achieved absorbed light power-to-temperature sensitivity is maintained at the level of a standard black spray. Finally, we show that while black spray has emissivity similar to a black body, the plasmonic absorber features a very low infra-red emissivity of almost 0.16, demonstrating its capability as selective coating for applications with operating temperatures up to 400°C, above which the nano-structure starts to deform.

Here, we describe copper nanoclusters grown by synchrotron radiolysis in concert with wet chemistry. The local structure of copper aggregates grown by reducing Cu(II) pentanedionate using synchrotron x-ray beam was studied in situ by x-ray absorption spectroscopy. A detailed analysis of the XANES and EXAFS spectra, compared with DFT calculations and full-potential non-muffin-tin multiple scattering calculations, identified the nanocluster as Cu13 with icosahedral symmetry. The novel \u201ccharged\u201d nanoclusters tightly bound to electron-donating amido molecules, which formed as a result of photo-induced deprotonation of ligand amines, were stabilized by irradiation.

        "text": "Dynamic processes, such as solid-state chemical reactions and phase changes, are ubiquitous in materials science, and developing a capability to observe the mechanisms of such processes on the atomic scale can offer new insights across a wide range of materials systems. Aberration correction in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has enabled atomic resolution imaging at significantly reduced beam energies and electron doses. It has also made possible the quantitative determination of the composition and occupancy of atomic columns using the atomic number (Z)-contrast annular dark-field (ADF) imaging available in STEM. Here we combine these benefits to record the motions and quantitative changes in the occupancy of individual atomic columns during a solid-state chemical reaction in manganese oxides. These oxides are of great interest for energy-storage applications such as for electrode materials in pseudocapacitors. We employ rapid scanning in STEM to both drive and directly observe the atomic scale dynamics behind the transformation of Mn3O4 into MnO. The results demonstrate we now have the experimental capability to understand the complex atomic mechanisms involved in phase changes and solid state chemical reactions.

The intrinsic transport properties of MoS2 emerge in the high density regime where conduction occurs via extended states. Here, we investigate the transport properties of mechanically exfoliated mono-, bi-, and trilayer MoS2 sheets over a wide range of carrier densities realized by a combination of ion gel top gate and SiO2 back gate, which allows us to achieve high charge carrier (>1013 cm−2) densities. We discuss the gating properties of the devices as a function of layer thickness and demonstrate resistivities as low as 1 kΩ for monolayer and 420 Ω for bilayer devices at 10 K. We show that from the capacitive coupling of the two gates, quantum capacitance can be roughly estimated to be on the order of 1 μF/cm2 for all devices studied. The temperature dependence of the carrier mobility in the high density regime indicates that short-range scatterers limit charge transport at low temperatures.

        "text": "Materials fail by the nucleation and propagation of a crack, the critical condition of which is quantitatively described by fracture mechanics that uses an intensity of singular stress field characteristically formed near the crack-tip. However, the continuum assumption basing fracture mechanics obscures the prediction of failure of materials at the nanoscale due to discreteness of atoms. Here, we demonstrate the ultimate dimensional limit of fracture mechanics at the nanoscale, where only a small number of atoms are included in a singular field of continuum stress formed near a crack tip. Surprisingly, a singular stress field of only several nanometers still governs fracture as successfully as that at the macroscale, whereas both the stress intensity factor and the energy release rate fail to describe fracture below a critically confined singular field of 2\u20133 nm, i.e., breakdown of fracture mechanics within the framework of the continuum theory. We further propose an energy-based theory that explicitly accounts for the discrete nature of atoms, and demonstrate that our theory not only successfully describes fracture even below the critical size but also seamlessly connects the atomic to macroscales. It thus provides a more universal fracture criterion, and novel atomistic insights into fracture.

In order to obtain excellent CDI performance, a rationally designed structure of electrode materials has been an urgent need for CDI application. In this work, a novel graphene sponge (GS) was proposed as CDI electrode for the first time. The GS was fabricated via directly freeze-drying graphene oxide solution followed by annealing in nitrogen atmosphere. The morphology, structure and electrochemical performance of GS were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The electrosorption performance of GS in NaCl solution was studied and compared with pristine graphene (PG). The results show that due to the unique 3D interconnected porous structure, large accessible surface area and low charge transfer resistance, GS electrode exhibits an ultrahigh electrosorption capacity of 14.9 mg g−1 when the initial NaCl concentration is ~500 mg L−1, which is about 3.2 times of that of PG (4.64 mg g−1), and to our knowledge, it should be the highest value reported for graphene electrodes in similar experimental conditions by now.

It was reported that fusion fuel gains exceeding unity on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) were achieved, but so far great deal of scientific and engineering challenges have to be overcome for realizing fusion power generation. There is a bottleneck for color-separation gratings in NIF and other similar inertial confinement fusion (ICF) lasers. Here we show a series of high performance phosphate-based glasses that can transmit the third harmonic frequency (3ω) laser light with high efficiency meanwhile filter the fundamental (1ω) and the second harmonic frequency (2ω) laser lights through direct absorption, and especially they exhibit excellent damage threshold induced by nanosecond pulse laser compared with that of the fused silica used in NIF. Yellowish-orange fluorescence emits during the laser-material interaction process, and it can be tailored through regulating the glass structure. Study on its structural origin suggests that the fluorescence emission is a key factor that conduces to the high laser-induced damage resistance of these glasses.

        "text": "Polymer solar cells are an exciting class of next-generation photovoltaics, because they hold promise for the realization of mechanically flexible, lightweight, large-area devices that can be fabricated by room-temperature solution processing1, 2. High power conversion efficiencies of ∼10% have already been reported in tandem polymer solar cells3. Here, we report that similar efficiencies are achievable in single-junction devices by reducing the tail state density below the conduction band of the electron acceptor in a high-performance photoactive layer made from a newly developed semiconducting polymer with a deepened valence energy level. Control over band tailing is realized through changes in the composition of the active layer and the structure order of the blend, both of which are known to be important factors in cell operation4, 5, 6. The approach yields cells with high power conversion efficiencies (∼9.94% certified) and enhanced photovoltage.

Black solid lines represent the best fitting results with a slope of 1.07, and the black dashed line corresponds to a slope of 1.43. Within the margins of experimental error, the dependence of VOC on I is essentially identical for all devices with a PC71BM content of more than 20%, following dVOC = (1.10 ± 0.10)(q/kT)d ln I, suggesting that bimolecular recombination is the dominant loss mechanism. A PC71BM content (10 wt%) that is too low will lead to a deviation.

        "text": "Core-shell nanoparticles (CSNPs) with diverse chemical compositions have been attracting greater attention in recent years. However, it has been a challenge to develop CSNPs with different crystal structures due to the lattice mismatch of the nanocrystals. Here we report a rational design of core-shell heterostructure consisting of NaYF4:Yb,Tm upconversion nanoparticle (UCN) as the core and ZnO semiconductor as the shell for potential application in photodynamic therapy (PDT). The core-shell architecture (confirmed by TEM and STEM) enables for improving the loading efficiency of photosensitizer (ZnO) as the semiconductor is directly coated on the UCN core. Importantly, UCN acts as a transducer to sensitize ZnO and trigger the generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce cancer cell death. We also present a firefly luciferase (FLuc) reporter gene based molecular biosensor (ARE-FLuc) to measure the antioxidant signaling response activated in cells during the release of ROS in response to the exposure of CSNPs under 980 nm NIR light. The breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and 4T1) exposed to CSNPs showed significant release of ROS as measured by aminophenyl fluorescein (APF) and ARE-FLuc luciferase assays, and ~45% cancer cell death as measured by MTT assay, when illuminated with 980 nm NIR light.

        "text": "We directly observed molecular-thick aqueous salt-solution pancakes on a hydrophobic graphite surface under ambient conditions employing atomic force microscopy. This observation indicates the unexpected molecular-scale hydrophilicity of the salt solution on graphite surfaces, which is different from the macroscopic wetting property of a droplet standing on the graphite surface. Interestingly, the pancakes spontaneously displayed strong positively charged behavior. Theoretical studies showed that the formation of such positively charged pancakes is attributed to cation\u2013π interactions between Na+ ions in the aqueous solution and aromatic rings on the graphite surface, promoting the adsorption of water molecules together with cations onto the graphite surface; i.e., Na+ ions as a medium adsorbed to the graphite surface through cation\u2013π interactions on one side while at the same time bonding to water molecules through hydration interaction on the other side at a molecular scale. These findings suggest that actual interactions regarding carbon-based graphitic surfaces including those of graphene, carbon nanotubes, and biochar may be significantly different from existing theory and they provide new insight into the control of surface wettability, interactions and related physical, chemical and biological processes.

        "text": "The Time-Reversed Ultrasound-Encoded (TRUE) light technique enables noninvasive focusing deep inside scattering media. However, the time-reversal procedure usually has a low signal-to-noise ratio because the intensity of ultrasound-encoded light is intrinsically low. Consequently, the contrast and resolution of TRUE focus is far from ideal, especially in the backscattering geometry, which is more practical in many biomedical applications. To improve the light intensity and resolution of TRUE focus, we developed an iterative TRUE (iTRUE) light focusing technique that employs the TRUE focus itself as a signal source (rather than diffused light) for subsequent TRUE procedures. Importantly, this iTRUE technique enables light focusing in backscattering mode. Here, we demonstrate the concept by focusing light in between scattering layers in a backscattering configuration and show that the light intensity at the focus is progressively enhanced by a factor of ~20. By scanning across a fluorescent bead between these two scattering layers, the focusing resolution in the ultrasound axial and lateral directions was improved ~2-fold and ~3-fold, respectively. We further explored the application of iTRUE in biological samples by focusing light between 1 mm thick chicken tissue and cartilage, and light intensity enhancements of the same order were also observed.

(a) Schematic experimental setup consisting of a DOPC system and an ultrasound modulation module. The probe beam reflected off the SLM is scattered by the sample and modulated by the ultrasound. The phase map of the ultrasound modulated light is measured by the camera and the conjugated phase map is displayed on the SLM, which modulates the probe beam again. (b)\u2013(e) Schematic demonstration of signal enhancement with iTRUE. (b) Without ultrasound modulation, the probe beam diffuses inside the scattering sample when the SLM is initially uncontrolled. (c) With ultrasound modulation, a small fraction of the probe beam is shifted in frequency and backscattered to the DOPC system. (d) The phase-conjugated copy of the measured ultrasound-modulated light is sent back to the sample. Although SNR of the measured wavefront is low, owing to the small amount of light being modulated in c, the playback light is still able to create a focus at the focus of the ultrasound. This playback light focus is modulated simultaneously by the ultrasound, and a more accurate wavefront can be measured for the next step. (e) A stronger light focus can thus be obtained. By repeating the playback and recording process, the light intensity focused at the focus of the ultrasound can be progressively increased.

        "text": "Quasi two-dimensional metasurfaces composed of subwavelength nanoresonator arrays can dramatically alter the properties of light in an ultra-thin planar geometry, enabling new optical functions such as anomalous reflection and refraction, polarization filtering, and wavefront modulation. However, previous metasurface-based nanostructures suffer from low efficiency, narrow bandwidth and/or limited field-of-view due to their operation near the plasmonic resonance. Here we demonstrate plasmonic metasurface-based nanostructures for high-efficiency, angle-insensitive polarization transformation over a broad octave-spanning bandwidth. The structures are realized by optimizing the anisotropic response of an array of strongly coupled nanorod resonators to tailor the interference of light at the subwavelength scale. Nanofabricated reflective half-wave and quarter-wave plates designed using this approach have measured polarization conversion ratios and reflection magnitudes greater than 92% over a broad wavelength range from 640 to 1290 nm and a wide field-of-view up to ±40°.

        "text": "Recently, triplet harvesting via a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) process has been established as a realistic route for obtaining ultimate internal electroluminescence (EL) quantum efficiency in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the possibility that the rather long transient lifetime of the triplet excited states would reduce operational stability due to an increased chance for unwarranted chemical reactions has been a concern. Herein, we demonstrate dual enhancement of EL efficiency and operational stability in OLEDs by employing a TADF molecule as an assistant dopant and a fluorescent molecule as an end emitter. The proper combination of assistant dopant and emitter molecules realized a \u201cone-way\u201d rapid Förster energy transfer of singlet excitons from TADF molecules to fluorescent emitters, reducing the number of cycles of intersystem crossing (ISC) and reverse ISC in the TADF molecules and resulting in a significant enhancement of operational stability compared to OLEDs with a TADF molecule as the end emitter. In addition, we found that the presence of this rapid energy transfer significantly suppresses singlet-triplet annihilation. Using this finely-tuned rapid triplet-exciton upconversion scheme, OLED performance and lifetime was greatly improved.

It was proposed that group I elements like Cs can be oxidized further under high pressure. Here we perform a comprehensive study for the CsF-F system at pressures up to 100 GPa, and find extremely versatile chemistry. A series of CsFn (n ≥ 1) compounds are predicted to be stable already at ambient pressure. Under pressure, 5p electrons of Cs atoms become active, with growing tendency to form Cs (III) and (V) valence states at fluorine-rich conditions. Although Cs (II) and (IV) are not energetically favoured, the interplay between two mechanisms (polyfluoride anions and polyvalent Cs cations) allows CsF2 and CsF4 compounds to be stable under pressure. The estimated defluorination temperatures of CsFn (n = 2,3,5) compounds at atmospheric pressure (218°C, 150°C, -15°C, respectively), are attractive for fluorine storage applications.

        "text": "Free carriers, polarons (P), in conjugated polymers play a key role in the performance of optoelectronic devices. Here, we present solid evidence that P can be predominantly generated from polaron pairs (PP) in a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) film under zero electric field. P formation from PP strongly depends on temperature. The temperature dependence of P starts to change around 300 K. P3HT exhibits a thermal molecular motion named the α1 relaxation process, in which the twisting motion of thiophene rings is released, in this temperature region. Thus, it can be claimed that the twisting motion of P3HT thiophene rings is one of the determining factors of the photodynamics of P in P3HT films. This finding holds true for poly(thiophene)s with different alkyl lengths and should be considered in the design and construction of highly-functionalized organic devices based on poly(thiophene)s.

        "text": "Band structure of transition metal oxides plays a critical role in many applications such as photo-catalysis, photovoltaics, and electroluminescent devices. In this work we report findings that the band structure of MoO3 can be significantly altered by a distortion in the octahedral coordination structure. We discovered that, in addition to epitaxial type of structural strain, chemical force such as hydrogen inclusion can also cause extended lattice distortion. The lattice distortion in hydrogenated MoO3 led to a significant reduction of the energy gap, overshadowing the Moss-Burstein effect of band filling. Charge doping simulations revealed that filling of conduction band drives the lattice distortion. This suggests that any charge transfer or n-type electron doping could lead to lattice distortion and consequentially a reduction in energy gap.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information Double-slit experiments illustrate the quintessential proof for wave\u2013particle complementarity. If information is missing about which slit the particle has traversed, the particle, behaving as a wave, passes simultaneously through both slits. This wave-like behaviour and corresponding interference is absent if \u2018which-slit\u2019 information exists. The essence of Einstein\u2013Bohr's debate about wave\u2013particle duality was whether the momentum transfer between a particle and a recoiling slit could mark the path, thus destroying the interference. To measure the recoil of a slit, the slits should move independently. We showcase a materialization of this recoiling double-slit gedanken experiment by resonant X-ray photoemission from molecular oxygen for geometries near equilibrium (coupled slits) and in a dissociative state far away from equilibrium (decoupled slits). Interference is observed in the former case, while the electron momentum transfer quenches the interference in the latter case owing to Doppler labelling of the counter-propagating atomic slits, in full agreement with Bohr's complementarity. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Schematic of the Einstein\u2013Bohr recoiling double-slit experiment. a, Einstein\u2013Bohr recoiling double-slit with coupled slits inspired by the original drawings from refs 1 and 3. b, Molecular analogue of the coupled slits situation in a. The ejected Auger electron transfers momentum to the whole \u2018rigid\u2019 molecule without breaking the symmetry (region near equilibrium, R0). c, Einstein\u2013Bohr recoiling double-slit with independently moving slits. d, Molecular analogue of the independently moving slits situation in c. In the dissociation region ( ∞), where the chemical bond is very weak, the ejected Auger electron transfers momentum exclusively to either of the two independent oxygen atoms. The symmetry is broken through Doppler labelling because the energies of the configurations with co- and counter-propagating oxygen atoms with respect to the electron's momentum are now very different (see Section \u2018Role of recoil effect for the MB and AP\u2019). The recoil momenta and the propagation directions of the dissociating atoms and electron are shown schematically by yellow, green and dashed blue arrows, respectively. Figure 2: Electron energy/ion energy and ion energy/angle correlation maps for the dissociative σ* and bound Rydberg core-excited states. a, Dissociative σ* state: the (Eel, Eion) correlation between Auger electron kinetic energy Eel and ion kinetic energy Eion exhibits a slope approximately two times steeper for the atomic peak (AP) than for the molecular band (MB); dashed lines are drawn to guide the eye. For the molecular band this correlation follows the law ., because the Doppler shift is small compared with the large width of the molecular band (ΔEel ≈ 10 eV). b, Bound Rydberg state: the (Eel, Eion) correlation for the molecular band. c, Dissociative σ* state: the (Eion, θ) correlation, where θ is the angle between the momenta of the Auger electron and of the ion, reflects the Doppler effect. The observed slope for the atomic peak is two times larger than for the molecular band. This is due to the site-dependent momentum exchange for the atomic peak, while for the molecular band the momentum transferred to the whole molecule is shared equally by both sites. This results in a Doppler shift that is half that observed for the atomic peak: . d, Bound Rydberg state: the slope of the observed (Eion, θ) correlation for the molecular band is similar to that for the dissociative σ* state in c. Figure 3: Physical picture of the momentum exchange mechanism near the equilibrium geometry and in the dissociative region. a, Molecular band (MB): near the equilibrium geometry (R0), the momentum of the Auger electron, k, is transferred to the molecule as a whole, preserving its symmetry (see Section \u2018Interference and nonlocal momentum transfer\u2019). Here, E = Eion + Eneut is the sum of the kinetic energies of the O+ ion and of the O atom. Atomic peak (AP): with the chemical bond being practically broken in the dissociation region ( ∞), the Auger electron transfers momentum exclusively to either the left or right O atom. Because the energy of the neutral atom is always the same, the different kinetic energies of the left and right O+ ions will induce different energies of the O+O and OO+ configurations, and will therefore break the symmetry of the cation. During wave packet evolution, the separation between the two O atoms increases from 2.28 a.u. to ∼4.5 a.u. (ref. 24 and Supplementary Information, page 8). Note that the boundary between the molecular and atomic decay regions is known only approximately (Supplementary Information, page 5). Thick red, light blue and thin black arrows indicate the propagation directions of O+, O and the Auger electron, respectively. b, Symmetry is broken in the classical region where the Doppler shift is larger than the lifetime broadening 2|kucosθ| > Γ ≈ 0.07 eV. In contrast, in a narrow quantum region around 90° (2|kucosθ| > Γ, where 2ku ≈ 1 eV), one cannot distinguish the left and right ions and the symmetry is preserved.

Middle panels: corresponding theoretical simulations. Right panels: one-dimensional representation of the experimental data (Supplementary Information, page 3) together with numerical simulations (blue solid lines). Error bars take into account the statistical quality of the data after appropriate correction for random coincidences, as discussed in the Supplementary Extended Methods. a\u2013c, Molecular band related to the decay from the bound core-excited Rydberg state, . A relatively symmetric YDS interference pattern is observed. Simulations were performed using multiple scattering theory31 and the scattering amplitudes from ref. 43. d\u2013f, Molecular band related to decay from the dissociative core-excited σ* state, . A slightly asymmetric YDS interference pattern is observed and the asymmetry is particularly visible in the one-dimensional plot (f). This is a consequence of the angular asymmetry of the Franck\u2013Condon amplitude44 (Supplementary Information, page 13). g\u2013i, Atomic peak related to late Auger decay from the dissociative core-excited σ* state, . The observed linear energy dispersion is due to the Auger\u2013Doppler effect23, 28. The YDS interference pattern observed for the molecular bands is absent here, but a stronger angular asymmetry is present. This asymmetry is the signature of Auger electron scattering by the neutral O atom that is sensitive to the ionization site, which is known here due to the Doppler labelling of the atomic slit (Supplementary Information, page 8).

        "text": "Detection of the extremely weak signals in spectroscopy over an extremely wide frequency region is central to diverse sciences, including materials science, biology, astronomy and chemistry. Here we show a new type of atomic-scale spectroscopy, heterodyne scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (HSTS), which is based on the innovative application of the nonlinear heterodyne-mixing detection at the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) heterojunction of STM tip\u2013vacuum\u2013sample. The principle of HSTS is identical to that of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) space telescope in terms of using heterojunction for detecting extremely weak signals by converting from terahertz region to lower frequency regions. The MIM detector of ALMA, which is composed of niobium\u2013titanium\u2013nitride (NbTiN) tip-insulator-NbTiN, is very similar in shape and size to that of HSTS. We successfully detect a heterodyne beat signal f3 (= |f2 − f1|) and intermodulation distortion via tunnelling current by superimposing two different AC signals, f1 and f2, onto the DC tunnelling current at a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface. We then obtain spectra of the localized electronic states of HOPG by using f3. HSTS can be performed with a high resolution and over a wide energy range, including the terahertz range.

The FFT resolution was set as 19.53 Hz. The spectra at the f3 region are also shown with 5 (10, 20 or 50) times greater intensity in each spectrum.

(a), Conventional STS spectrum measured by the lock-in detection method (solid line) and HSTS spectra measured by FFT (circle and triangle plots for the f1 and f2 signals, respectively). The measurements were conducted at the same position near the defect of HOPG at 3.23 K (set-points in both conventional STS and HSTS: tunnelling current It = 100 pA and sample bias Vs = 150 mV). For HSTS, the intensities of f1 (3501.0 Hz) and f2 (3200.7 Hz) were measured by FFT after normalization by the intensity of input signals of f1 and f2 as functions of the sample bias (see Supplementary Information). The FFT resolution was set as 2.44 Hz. The conventional STS spectrum was measured using the lock-in detection technique with a modulation bias of 20 mV (peak-to-peak amplitude) at 3.5 kHz. (b), The intensity of the heterodyne beat signal f3 (300.3 Hz) measured by FFT was plotted as a function of the sample bias (red circles).

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information Thrombosis and biofouling of extracorporeal circuits and indwelling medical devices cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. We apply a bioinspired, omniphobic coating to tubing and catheters and show that it completely repels blood and suppresses biofilm formation. The coating is a covalently tethered, flexible molecular layer of perfluorocarbon, which holds a thin liquid film of medical-grade perfluorocarbon on the surface. This coating prevents fibrin attachment, reduces platelet adhesion and activation, suppresses biofilm formation and is stable under blood flow in vitro. Surface-coated medical-grade tubing and catheters, assembled into arteriovenous shunts and implanted in pigs, remain patent for at least 8 h without anticoagulation. This surface-coating technology could reduce the use of anticoagulants in patients and help to prevent thrombotic occlusion and biofouling of medical devices.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information A single nanopore structure that embeds all components of an electrochemical storage device could bring about the ultimate miniaturization in energy storage. Self-alignment of electrodes within each nanopore may enable closer and more controlled spacing between electrodes than in state-of-art batteries. Such an \u2018all-in-one\u2019 nanopore battery array would also present an alternative to interdigitated electrode structures that employ complex three-dimensional geometries with greater spatial heterogeneity. Here, we report a battery composed of an array of nanobatteries connected in parallel, each composed of an anode, a cathode and a liquid electrolyte confined within the nanopores of anodic aluminium oxide, as an all-in-one nanosize device. Each nanoelectrode includes an outer Ru nanotube current collector and an inner nanotube of V2O5 storage material, forming a symmetric full nanopore storage cell with anode and cathode separated by an electrolyte region. The V2O5 is prelithiated at one end to serve as the anode, with pristine V2O5 at the other end serving as the cathode, forming a battery that is asymmetrically cycled between 0.2 V and 1.8 V. The capacity retention of this full cell (relative to 1 C values) is 95% at 5 C and 46% at 150 C, with a 1,000-cycle life. From a fundamental point of view, our all-in-one nanopore battery array unveils an electrochemical regime in which ion insertion and surface charge mechanisms for energy storage become indistinguishable, and offers a testbed for studying ion transport limits in dense nanostructured electrode arrays.

        "text": "Extensive efforts have been devoted to develop innovative synthesis strategies for nanomaterials in order to exploit the true potential of nanotechnology. However, most approaches require high temperature or high pressure to favor crystallization. Here we highlight an unconventional approach for the confined-space synthesis of the single crystal TiO2 nanowires in the atmospheric vessel at low temperature by cleverly manipulating the unique physical properties of straight-chain saturated fatty acids. Our method also applys to icosane due to its straight-chain saturated hydrocarbon structure and similar physical properties to the saturated fatty acids. Interestingly, we also found that the unsaturated fatty acids can facilitate the crystal growth, but their bent chains lead to the formation of TiO2 particle aggregates. In addition, we demonstrate the growth of TiO2 nanowires on arbitrary substrates, which are of great importance for their wider applications. We thus anticipate our presented method to be a possible starting point for non-classical crystallization strategies and be easily adapted for the fabrication of all other inorganic materials.

        "text": "Polypyrrole (PPy)/cellulose (PPCL) composite papers were fabricated by vapor phase polymerization. Importantly, the vapor-phase deposition of PPy onto cellulose was assisted by employing different co-vapors namely methanol, ethanol, benzene, water, toluene and hexane, in addition to pyrrole. The resulting PPCL papers possessed high mechanical flexibility, large surface-to-volume ratio, and good redox properties. Their main properties were highly influenced by the nature of the co-vaporized solvent. The morphology and oxidation level of deposited PPy were tuned by employing co-vapors during the polymerization, which in turn led to change in the electrochemical properties of the PPCL papers. When methanol and ethanol were used as co-vapors, the conductivities of PPCL papers were found to have improved five times, which was likely due to the enhanced orientation of PPy chain by the polar co-vapors with high dipole moment. The specific capacitance of PPCL papers obtained using benzene, toluene, water and hexane co-vapors was higher than those of the others, which is attributed to the enlarged effective surface area of the electrode material. The results indicate that the judicious choice and combination of co-vapors in vapor-deposition polymerization (VDP) offers the possibility of tuning the morphological, electrical, and electrochemical properties of deposited conducting polymers.

        "text": "Efficient generation and detection of indistinguishable twin photons are at the core of quantum information and communications technology (Q-ICT). These photons are conventionally generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC), which is a probabilistic process, and hence occurs at a limited rate, which restricts wider applications of Q-ICT. To increase the rate, one had to excite SPDC by higher pump power, while it inevitably produced more unwanted multi-photon components, harmfully degrading quantum interference visibility. Here we solve this problem by using recently developed 10 GHz repetition-rate-tunable comb laser, combined with a group-velocity-matched nonlinear crystal, and superconducting nanowire single photon detectors. They operate at telecom wavelengths more efficiently with less noises than conventional schemes, those typically operate at visible and near infrared wavelengths generated by a 76 MHz Ti Sapphire laser and detected by Si detectors. We could show high interference visibilities, which are free from the pump-power induced degradation. Our laser, nonlinear crystal, and detectors constitute a powerful tool box, which will pave a way to implementing quantum photonics circuits with variety of good and low-cost telecom components, and will eventually realize scalable Q-ICT in optical infra-structures.

A comb laser with a 10\u20130.625 GHz tunable-repetition-rate at 1553 nm wavelength is amplified by a high-power erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA), and frequency doubled by a 10-mm-long type-0 periodically poled lithium niobate wave guide (PPLN-WG, by NTT Electronics, polling period = 18.2 μm). Then, after filtered by short-pass filters, the 776.5 nm laser light from second harmonic generation (SHG) pumps a 30-mm type-II periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate crystal (PPKTP, by Raicol, poling period = 46.1 μm, temperature = 47.8°C) for SPDC. The downconverted photons, the signal and idler, are filtered by long-pass filters, separated by a polarization beamsplitter (PBS), and coupled into single mode fibers (SMF) by couplers (SMFC). (a) The collected photons are directly detected by SNSPDs, which are connected to a time interval analyzer (TIA) for the measurement of Time of Arrival (ToA). (b) SMFs are connected to a fiber beamsplitter (FBS) by two fiber connectors (FC), for the test of Hong-Ou-Mandel dip. A half-wave plate and a quarter-wave plate are added to guarantee the signal and idler photons have the same polarization in FBS. For comparison, we also introduce a 76 MHz pump laser (Mira900, at 776.5 nm, around 2 ps). An iris is inserted for the 76 MHz laser to control the beam size, so as to make the coincidence counts comparable for both pump lasers. Full size image View in article Figure 2: The spectra.

        "text": "Light carrying an orbital angular momentum (OAM) displays an optical phase front rotating in space and time and a vanishing intensity, a so-called vortex, in the center. Beyond continuous-wave vortex beams, optical pulses with a finite OAM are important for many areas of science and technology, ranging from the selective manipulation and excitation of matter to telecommunications. Generation of vortex pulses with a duration of few optical cycles requires new methods for characterising their coherence properties in space and time. Here we report a novel approach for flexibly shaping and characterising few-cycle vortex pulses of tunable topological charge with two sequentially arranged spatial light modulators. The reconfigurable optical arrangement combines interferometry, wavefront sensing, time-of-flight and nonlinear correlation techniques in a very compact setup, providing complete spatio-temporal coherence maps at minimum pulse distortions. Sub-7 fs pulses carrying different optical angular momenta are generated in single and multichannel geometries and characterised in comparison to zero-order Laguerre-Gaussian beams. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the shortest pulse durations reported for direct vortex shaping and detection with spatial light modulators. This access to space-time coupling effects with sub-femtosecond time resolution opens new prospects for tailored twisted light transients of extremely short duration. Subject terms: Optical manipulation and tweezers\u2022 Ultrafast photonics At a glance Figures View all figures Figure 1: Experimental setup for temporal coherence mapping of few-cycle vortex pulses with two subsequently arranged spatial light modulators. Ultrashort pulses from a Ti:sapphire laser (6.5 fs, 800 nm, 80 MHz) are reflected from a first spatial light modulator (SLM1, generation part) to shape a pulsed vortex beam (Inset: schematic of a twisted pulse). This beam is coupled into a Michelson interferometer containing a beam splitter (BS) and producing phase-locked pulse pairs with variable delay (mirrors M1, M2). Wavefront and local temporal coherence are analysed by a nonlinear Shack-Hartmann sensor consisting of axicons programmed in a second spatial light modulator (SLM2, characterisation part), a 10-μm thick nonlinear crystal (BBO) for second harmonic generation, a filter to suppress the fundamental light and a matrix camera detector (EMCCD). By modifying this modular setup, two geometrical configurations with (a) single vortex beams, and (b) multiple vortex beams were studied. Dispersion is compensated by 4 double chirped mirrors (DCMs) and a pair of thin CaF2 wedges. For reasons of simplicity, only one DCM mirror is shown in the figure. Full size image View in article Figure 2: Time integrated SHG signal of few-cycle Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian beams. The examples show the adaptive shaping of vortex beams of different topological charges (m = 0 to 3) in the fundamental with low-dispersion LCoS-SMSs. The frequency conversion doubles the topological charge (mSHG = 0 to 6). Scratch-like substructures in the profiles are caused by inhomogeneities in the SHG crystal. Full size image View in article Figure 3: Wavefront twist of few-cycle vortex pulses measured in the Shack-Hartmann configuration. The sub-beams are generated by programming axicons in SLM2 (setup in Fig. 1). Orbital angular momenta are indicated by maps of transversal Poynting vector components for (a) fundamental and (b) SHG wavelengths (normalised, after analysing the intensity spot displacements of a reconfigurable nondiffracting S-H wavefront sensor). The respective topological charges are m = 1 and mSHG = 2. The different lengths of the vectors in (a) and (b) are directly proportional to these numbers. Full size image View in article Figure 4: Spatially resolved temporal coherence of few-cycle pulses without and with orbital angular monentum. Spatially resolved temporal coherence maps obtained by second-order autocorrelation of a Gaussian and a Laguerre-Gauss beam with topological charges of (a) mSHG = 0 and (b) mSHG = 2. The distributions were derived from central cuts through the spot arrays (data corresponding to Fig. 3b). The data sets allow for a reconstruction of complete 3D temporal coherence profiles. The conservation of temporal coherence information along the selected cut direction is indicated by homogeneous spatio-temporal distributions of the pulse duration in both cases. The detailed analysis shows some slight inhomogeneities over the beam cross section (cf. Figs. 6a, b). The curvature in time indicates the wavefront curvature of the field cycles in space. The theoretical time resolution is about 0.12 fs. Insets: cut profiles along the red bows and corresponding envelope (green solid curve). The centre-to-centre distance between neighbouring sub-beams of the orthogonal beam array was about 478 μm in this experiment.

The curved surface was interpolated from the centers of gravity of the measured local second order temporal autocorrelation functions within the line of highest field strength (from the 3D autocorrelation data set used in Fig. 3). It represents the spatial pulse front of a particular subcycle. (b), (c) Temporal coherence maps of few-cycle Gaussian (bottom, left) and Laguerre-Gaussian beams (bottom, right) were determined by autocorrelation measurements. The columns show distribution of the FWHM of the second order autocorrelation functions for temporal cuts along the propagation axes of all sub-beams (needle beams). The uncertainty of the FWHM of the local autocorrelation functions is less than ±400 attoseconds. Opposite angles of view were chosen for the two plots to better visualise the relevant features.

(a) The spatially resolved second order autocorrelation function of one of the nondiffracting sub-beams (\u201cneedle beams\u201d) of the Shack-Hartmann sensor under strong off-axis conditions (angle of incidence about 43°) reveals significant spatio-temporal coupling effects corrupting the pulse quality. The resulting pulse duration was by about 450 attoseconds longer compared to the corrected case (10 fs FWHM of the autocorrelation function, with dispersion compensation) shown in (b). Here, the programmed axicon shape was adapted to the off-axis geometry. For noise reduction and compensation of slight intensity fluctuations at certain time intervals, the experimental data was low-pass filtered.

The grey value map was transferred into a phase map of SLM1 for the generation of a 2 × 2 array of thin spiral phase plates (circular areas) with a period of 260 pixels (2.1 mm). To reduce the background signal in the plane of interest, a checkered pattern (2 × 2 pixels per square) was applied to the passive areas between the phase plates (inset). The dark and bright part corresponds to a higher and lower effective refractive index, respectively. Full size image View in article Figure 8: Multichannel vortex detection. (a) Shack-Hartmann plot.

High purity α-MnO2 rectangular nanowires were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method with microwave-assisted procedures. The microstructure analysis indicates that the nanowires grow in the [0 0 1] direction with the (2 1 0) plane as the surface. Mn3+ and Mn2+ ions are not found in the system by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The effective magnetic moment of the manganese ions fits in with the theoretical and experimental values of Mn4+ very well. The uncoupled spins in 3d3 orbitals of the Mn4+ ions in MnO6 octahedra on the rough surface are responsible for the net magnetic moment. Spin glass behavior is observed through magnetic measurements. Furthermore, the exchange bias effect is observed for the first time in pure α-MnO2 phase due to the coupling of the surface spin glass with the antiferromagnetic α-MnO2 matrix. These α-MnO2 nanowires, with a spin-glass-like behavior and with an exchange bias effect excited by the uncoupled surface spins, should therefore inspire further study concerning the origin, theory, and applicability of surface structure induced magnetism in nanostructures.

        "text": "We present a technique that uses an externally applied electric field to self-assemble monolayers of mixtures of particles into molecular-like hierarchical arrangements on fluid-liquid interfaces. The arrangements consist of composite particles (analogous to molecules) which are arranged in a pattern. The structure of a composite particle depends on factors such as the relative sizes of the particles and their polarizabilities, and the electric field intensity. If the particles sizes differ by a factor of two or more, the composite particle has a larger particle at its core and several smaller particles form a ring around it. The number of particles in the ring and the spacing between the composite particles depend on their polarizabilities and the electric field intensity. Approximately same sized particles form chains (analogous to polymeric molecules) in which positively and negatively polarized particles alternate.

The distance between the composite particles was 7.4a which was approximately 12% larger than the experimental distance in (b) for the same electric field intensity.

Glass particles were arranged on a triangular lattice and copolymer particles were embedded in this lattice. The latter attracted nearby glass particles to form composite particles. The lattice spacing increased with increasing electric field intensity, but the number of particles in the ring of a composite particle remained constant only for a range of intensity.

Nonvolatile electric-field control of magnetization is extremely important for information storage applications, but has been rarely realized in single-phase multiferroic materials. Here we demonstrate the prominent direct and converse magnetoelectric effects in the Y-type hexaferrite BaSrCoZnFe11AlO22 single crystal. The electric polarization due to conical magnetic structure can be totally reversed by a small magnetic field, giving rise to large magnetoelectric coefficients of 6000 and 4000 ps/m at 100 and 200 K, respectively. The ab-plane magnetization can be controlled by electric fields with a large hysteresis, leading to nonvolatile change of magnetization. In addition, the reversal of magnetization by electric fields is also realized at 200 K.

        "text": "Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) is a powerful tool to study the electronic spin and symmetry features at both surfaces and interfaces to ultrathin top layers. However, the very low mean free path of the photoelectrons usually prevents a direct access to the properties of buried interfaces. The latter are of particular interest since they crucially influence the performance of spintronic devices like magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Here, we introduce spin-resolved extremely low energy photoemission spectroscopy (ELEPS) to provide a powerful way for overcoming this limitation. We apply ELEPS to the interface formed between the half-metallic Heusler compound Co2MnSi and the insulator MgO, prepared as in state-of-the-art Co2MnSi/MgO-based MTJs. The high accordance between the spintronic fingerprint of the free Co2MnSi surface and the Co2MnSi/MgO interface buried below up to 4 nm MgO provides clear evidence for the high interface sensitivity of ELEPS to buried interfaces. Although the absolute values of the interface spin polarization are well below 100%, the now accessible spin- and symmetry-resolved wave functions are in line with the predicted existence of non-collinear spin moments at the Co2MnSi/MgO interface, one of the mechanisms evoked to explain the controversially discussed performance loss of Heusler-based MTJs at room temperature.

Left: The sample, constituted of a Co2MnSi thin film covered with MgO, is illuminated with pulsed laser light with photon energy hν = 5.9 eV. MgO is almost transparent to the laser, while the laser penetration depth (blue shaded area) in Co2MnSi is much larger than the inelastic mean free path of the electrons excited by the laser (orange shaded area). Moreover, the inelastic mean free path of the photoelectrons in MgO is virtually infinite (orange area with black pattern). As a consequence, photoelectrons originate mainly from the Co2MnSi/MgO interface and can travel without inelastic scattering in the MgO layer. The long inelastic mean free path of the photoelectrons in MgO is due to the fact that their excess energy is at maximum 2.1 eV above the conduction band minimum, which drastically reduces the phase space available for inelastic scattering. Right: Energy level alignment at the Co2MnSi/MgO system. The position of the valence band (VB) onset is extracted from the UPS measurements in Fig. 2 (a), while the position of the conduction band (CB) is inferred from the value of 7.8 eV of the MgO band gap taken from Refs. 10, 35.

The As comparison, pristine Bi2WO6 nanoparticles have poor specific capacitance of 574 F/g at a charge and discharge currents of 2 A/g with weak cycle life. Though analyzing the Cyclic voltammetry curves, it is found that there are two oxidation reaction occurring in the materials: oxidation of Bi (III) to Bi (IV) and Bi (III) to Bi (V). The oxidation of Bi (III) to Bi (IV) is reversible while Bi (III) to Bi (V) will cause nonreversible destroy on structure. In this nano-Bi2WO6/reduced graphene oxide composite, graphene with well conductivity will enhance the electrically conducting as charge transfer channel, so that electrons will be transfer much faster in oxidation and most Bi (III) is oxidized to be Bi (IV) which ensure larger specific capacitance and long cycle life.

        "text": "We describe a novel method (FLICS, FLow Image Correlation Spectroscopy) to extract flow speeds in complex vessel networks from a single raster-scanned optical xy-image, acquired in vivo by confocal or two-photon excitation microscopy. Fluorescent flowing objects produce diagonal lines in the raster-scanned image superimposed to static morphological details. The flow velocity is obtained by computing the Cross Correlation Function (CCF) of the intensity fluctuations detected in pairs of columns of the image. The analytical expression of the CCF has been derived by applying scanning fluorescence correlation concepts to drifting optically resolved objects and the theoretical framework has been validated in systems of increasing complexity. The power of the technique is revealed by its application to the intricate murine hepatic microcirculatory system where blood flow speed has been mapped simultaneously in several capillaries from a single xy-image and followed in time at high spatial and temporal resolution.

        "text": "The dynamics of quantized magnetic vortices and their pinning by materials defects determine electromagnetic properties of superconductors, particularly their ability to carry non-dissipative currents. Despite recent advances in the understanding of the complex physics of vortex matter, the behavior of vortices driven by current through a multi-scale potential of the actual materials defects is still not well understood, mostly due to the scarcity of appropriate experimental tools capable of tracing vortex trajectories on nanometer scales. Using a novel scanning superconducting quantum interference microscope we report here an investigation of controlled dynamics of vortices in lead films with sub-Angstrom spatial resolution and unprecedented sensitivity. We measured, for the first time, the fundamental dependence of the elementary pinning force of multiple defects on the vortex displacement, revealing a far more complex behavior than has previously been recognized, including striking spring softening and broken-spring depinning, as well as spontaneous hysteretic switching between cellular vortex trajectories. Our results indicate the importance of thermal fluctuations even at 4.2 K and of the vital role of ripples in the pinning potential, giving new insights into the mechanisms of magnetic relaxation and electromagnetic response of superconductors.

        "text": "Over the past years, invisibility cloaks have been extensively discussed since transformation optics emerges. Generally, the electromagnetic parameters of invisibility cloaks are complicated tensors, yet difficult to realize. As a special method of transformation optics, conformal mapping helps us design invisibility cloak with isotropic materials of a refractive index distribution. However, for all proposed isotropic cloaks, the refractive index range is at such a breadth that challenges current experimental fabrication. In this work, we propose two new kinds of logarithm conformal mappings for invisible device designs. For one of the mappings, the refractive index distribution of conformal cloak varies from 0 to 9.839, which is more feasible for future implementation. Numerical simulations by using finite element method are performed to confirm the theoretical analysis.

Here a non-precious metal oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electocatalyst based on titanium nitride/titanium carbonitride hierarchical structures (TNTCNHS) is demonstrated as high activity as Pt/C. In alkaline condition, tuning interface/mass ratio of TiN/TiCN, we observed the onset potential of ~0.93 V vs. RHE and a limit diffusion current density of ~5.1 mA cm−2 (at a rotating speed of 1600 rpm) on TNTCNHS with a relative low catalyst loading of ~0.1 mg cm−2. The kinetic current, durability and tolerance to crossover effect studies reveal even more efficient than carbon-supported platinum. The architecture fabrication for such electrocatalyst is easy to realize in industrial-scale facilities, for the use of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique could support a huge area production (more than 10000 cm2 for one pot) to satisfy the enormous market requirements in the future.

        "text": "Developing rationally controlled bottom-up device fabrication processes is essential for the achievement of high performance optimal devices. We report a controlled, seedless and site-selective hydrothermal technique to fabricate high-performance nanostructured ZnO UV-detectors directly on-chip. We demonstrate that by controlling the nanowire growth process, via tuning the experimental parameters such as the concentration of reactants and the growth time, and by introducing a refresh of the growth solution, the device structure efficiency can be enhanced to significantly improve its performance. The on-chip fabricated bridging nanosyringe ultraviolet detector demonstrates improved sensitivity (~105), nanowatts detectability, and ultrafast response-time (90 ms) and recovery-time (210 ms). The improvement in response-time and recovery-time is attributed to the unique nanowire-nanowire junction barrier dominated resistance and the direct contact between ZnO and Au electrodes. Furthermore, the enhanced sensitivity and nanowatts detectability of the bridging nanosyringe device are due to the reduction in dimensionality and ultrahigh surface-to-volume ratio. This work paves the way toward low cost, large scale, low temperature, seedless and site-selective fabrication of high performance ZnO nanowire sensors on flexible and transparent substrates.

However, label-based approaches are limited by the risk of tag detachment over time, and label-free spectroscopic methods have slow imaging speeds, weak photoluminescence signals and strong backgrounds. Here, we present a label-free mass spectrometry imaging method to detect carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide and carbon nanodots in mice. The large molecular weights of nanoparticles are difficult to detect using conventional mass spectrometers, but our method overcomes this problem by using the intrinsic carbon cluster fingerprint signal of the nanomaterials. We mapped and quantified the sub-organ distribution of the nanomaterials in mice. Our results showed that most carbon nanotubes and nanodots were found in the outer parenchyma of the kidney, and all three materials were seen in the red pulp of the spleen. The highest concentrations of nanotubes in the spleen were found within the marginal zone.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information The anomalous transport of important materials such as high-temperature superconductors and other \u2018bad metals\u2019 is not well understood theoretically. In an incoherent metal, transport is controlled by the collective diffusion of energy and charge rather than by quasiparticle or momentum relaxation. Here, we explore the possibility of a universal bound D ≳ ℏνF2/(kBT) on the underlying diffusion constants in an incoherent metal. Such a bound is loosely motivated by results from holographic duality, the uncertainty principle and measurements of diffusion in strongly interacting non-metallic systems. Metals close to saturating this bound are shown to have a linear-in-temperature resistivity with an underlying dissipative timescale matching that recently deduced from experimental data on a wide range of metals. This bound may therefore be responsible for the ubiquitous appearance of high-temperature regimes in metals with T-linear resistivity. To establish this calls for direct measurements of diffusive processes and of charge susceptibilities in incoherent metals. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Quasiparticle bounds versus incoherent bounds. Schematic illustration of the role of the MIR bound and the proposed diffusivity bound in the resistivity versus temperature plane. Figure 2: Lorenz ratio as a function of temperature.

Direct visualization of such supramolecular interactions within host\u2013guest systems is extremely challenging, but crucial to understanding their function. We report a comprehensive study that combines neutron scattering, synchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction, and computational modelling to define the detailed binding at a molecular level of \u200bacetylene, \u200bethylene and \u200bethane within the porous host NOTT-300. This study reveals simultaneous and cooperative hydrogen-bonding, π···π stacking interactions and intermolecular dipole interactions in the binding of \u200bacetylene and \u200bethylene to give up to 12 individual weak supramolecular interactions aligned within the host to form an optimal geometry for the selective binding of hydrocarbons. We also report the cooperative binding of a mixture of \u200bacetylene and \u200bethylene within the porous host, together with the corresponding breakthrough experiments and analysis of adsorption isotherms of gas mixtures.

The values of Qst for \u200bC2H2 uptake lie in the range 30\u201332 kJ mol−1 and do not vary much with increasing \u200bC2H2 loading. In contrast, values of Qst for \u200bC2H4 uptake lie in the range 16\u201328 kJ mol−1 and increase with increasing \u200bC2H4 loading, which indicates the presence of a strong C2H4\u2013C2H4 interaction. Overall, ΔS decreases with increasing surface coverage over the whole loading range for both \u200bC2H2 and \u200bC2H4. The Qst of the \u200bC2H6 adsorption is subject to uncertainties because of the low isotherm uptake. a.u., arbitrary units.

A difference plot for DFT-calculated INS spectra of bare and the \u200bC2H2-loaded NOTT-300 is shown in d, and confirms good agreement with the experimental difference INS spectra. Owing to the strong rotational recoil motion of adsorbed \u200bC2H4 and \u200bC2H6 molecules, and to the lack of resolved energy-transfer peaks, the corresponding difference plots for solid-state DFT calculations are not shown in e and f. In the DFT calculation of NOTT-300·C2H4, two models with different orientations of the adsorbed \u200bC2H4 molecules were found. NOTT-300·C2H4G and NOTT-300·C2H4E in b represent the \u2018ground-state\u2019 and \u2018excited-state\u2019 structural models, respectively. Peaks I, III and IV in d are assigned to translational, asymmetric and symmetric C\u2013H vibrational motions of the adsorbed \u200bC2H2 molecules, respectively. Peaks II and V in d are assigned to the bending/wagging motions of the \u2013OH groups and aromatic C\u2013H groups on two \u200bbenzene rings, respectively.

The carbon atoms of the second site of \u200bC2H2 are highlighted in blue. Sites I and II represent two preferred binding sites within the pore: molecules at site I interact with the Al\u2013OH groups and those at site II bind primarily with molecules at site I via dipole interactions. The energy barrier for 1D rotational motion between NOTT-300·C2H4G and NOTT-300·C2H4E was estimated to be 0.93 kJ mol−1. The bond distances (Å) obtained from DFT calculations, synchrotron X-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction experiments are labelled as D, S and N, respectively. Throughout this report, the uncertainties for the bond distance obtained from synchrotron X-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction experiments are below 0.01 and 0.02 Å, respectively. To simplify the positional disorder of the guest molecules caused by thermal motion, optimized models from the calculations are shown here for clarity, and disordered models are shown in the Supplementary Information. Owing to the uncertainty of the hydrogen atom location, the π···HO hydrogen bonds are described as the distance between the O centre and the centroid of the C2 bond of the hydrocarbon molecules.

Yet, creating protein-based assemblies with specific geometries and chemical properties remains challenging. Highly porous materials represent particularly interesting targets for designed assembly. Here, we utilize a strategy of fusing two natural protein oligomers using a continuous alpha-helical linker to design a novel protein that self assembles into a 750 kDa, 225 Å diameter, cube-shaped cage with large openings into a 130 Å diameter inner cavity. A crystal structure of the cage showed atomic-level agreement with the designed model, while electron microscopy, native mass spectrometry and small angle X-ray scattering revealed alternative assembly forms in solution. These studies show that accurate design of large porous assemblies with specific shapes is feasible, while further specificity improvements will probably require limiting flexibility to select against alternative forms. These results provide a foundation for the design of advanced materials with applications in bionanotechnology, nanomedicine and material sciences. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Models of the engineered fusion protein and its assembled cage structure. a, The designed fusion protein, with trimeric \u200bKDPGal aldolase (green), the four-residue helical linker (blue) and the dimeric domain of \u200bFkpA protein (orange) shown with lines for the three-fold (cyan) and two-fold (magenta) symmetry axes. b, Model of the intended 24-subunit cage with octahedral symmetry in a bounding box (left).

Figure 2: Crystal structure of the designed cubic cage ATC-HL3. a, Four complete ATC-HL3 cages, coloured differently, are packed within a unit cell (shown in blue lines). b, The cube-shaped cage observed in the crystal matches the design with high accuracy. The crystal structure is shown in green ribbon and the intended design is shown in cyan ribbon. The two show near-perfect overlap. c, The packing alignment of cages in the crystal produces a highly porous protein lattice. A 3 × 3 block of unit cells is shown. The two independent protein chains in the asymmetric unit are coloured differently (purple or green). Figure 3: Native MS of the ATC-HL3 protein cage. a, The native mass spectrum (top) indicated three major assembly forms composed from 12, 18 and 24 subunits. The sizes of these three major assembly species were confirmed by MS/MS analysis (below) in which the masses were examined after stripping one subunit from each assembly form to give (n \u2013 1) subunits. A trimeric species was also evident in the native mass spectrum (top). b, Hypothetical models are shown of the three major assembly forms observed: a tetrahedron (top), a triangular prism (middle) and the cube (bottom). The cube form shown is the intended computation design, while the two smaller forms were constructed by rigid body positioning of dimers and trimers allowed by minor bending at the linkers between protein domains. Trimers occupying different vertices are coloured differently.

For comparison to what would be expected for electron micrographs of the designed protein assembly, calculated projections (middle) are shown of models of the 24-subunit cube assembly (the intended design) and an alternative 12-subunit tetrahedral assembly (both calculated using a 4 nm low-pass image filter).

The Guinier region is shown in the inset. Its near-linearity indicating the absence of other aggregated forms of the protein. A residual error plot (bottom), expressed as a ratio of the observed:calculated scattering intensity (with an ideal value of 1) is shown at the bottom. The close agreement between the calculated and observed profiles supports the modelling of the assembly in solution as a mixture of the 12-mer, 18-mer and 24-mer assembly forms. b, Microcrystal peaks observed on the SAXS profile after temperature annealing of a low salt (50 mM \u200bammonium sulfate) condition.

        "text": "The interplay between the quasi 1-dimensional CuO-chains and the 2-dimensional CuO2 planes of YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO) has been in focus for a long time. Although the CuO-chains are known to be important as charge reservoirs that enable superconductivity for a range of oxygen doping levels in YBCO, the understanding of the dynamics of its temperature-driven metal-superconductor transition (MST) remains a challenge. We present a combined study using x-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) revealing how a reconstruction of the apical O(4)-derived interplanar orbitals during the MST of optimally doped YBCO leads to substantial hole-transfer from the chains into the planes, i.e. self-doping. Our ionic model calculations show that localized divalent charge-transfer configurations are expected to be abundant in the chains of YBCO. While these indeed appear in the RIXS spectra from YBCO in the normal, metallic, state, they are largely suppressed in the superconducting state and, instead, signatures of Cu trivalent charge-transfer configurations in the planes become enhanced. In the quest for understanding the fundamental mechanism for high-Tc-superconductivity (HTSC) in perovskite cuprate materials, the observation of such an interplanar self-doping process in YBCO opens a unique novel channel for studying the dynamics of HTSC.

(B) Schematic illustration of the charge-transfer between chains and planes, taking place when YBCO is cooled through the MST. In the superconducting phase the 3d8L+1 configuration at Cu(1)-sites in the chains is suppressed, while at Cu(2)-sites the 3d9L−1 configuration is increased. The net effect is a self doping of the superconducting planes in the MST. (C) The relevant orbitals for the self doping mechanism are the (partially empty) 3d3z2−r2 and 3dy2−z2 orbitals at the Cu(1) and Cu(2,3)-sites and the connecting apical oxygen O 2pz orbitals.

        "text": "Control synthesis of high quality large-area graphene on transition metals (TMs) by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is the most fascinating approach for practical device applications. Interaction of carbon atoms and TMs is quite critical to obtain graphene with precise layer number, crystal size and structure. Here, we reveal a solid phase reaction process to achieve Cu assisted graphene growth in nanoscale by in-situ transmission electron microscope (TEM). Significant structural transformation of amorphous carbon nanofiber (CNF) coated with Cu is observed with an applied potential in a two probe system. The coated Cu particle recrystallize and agglomerate toward the cathode with applied potential due to joule heating and large thermal gradient. Consequently, the amorphous carbon start crystallizing and forming sp2 hybridized carbon to form graphene sheet from the tip of Cu surface. We observed structural deformation and breaking of the graphene nanoribbon with a higher applied potential, attributing to saturated current flow and induced Joule heating. The observed graphene formation in nanoscale by the in-situ TEM process can be significant to understand carbon atoms and Cu interaction.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 Accession codes\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information Nanobodies are single-domain antibodies derived from the variable regions of Camelidae atypical immunoglobulins. They show promise as high-affinity reagents for research, diagnostics and therapeutics owing to their high specificity, small size (~15 kDa) and straightforward bacterial expression. However, identification of repertoires with sufficiently high affinity has proven time consuming and difficult, hampering nanobody implementation. Our approach generates large repertoires of readily expressible recombinant nanobodies with high affinities and specificities against a given antigen. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through the production of large repertoires of nanobodies against two antigens, GFP and mCherry, with Kd values into the subnanomolar range. After mapping diverse epitopes on GFP, we were also able to design ultrahigh-affinity dimeric nanobodies with Kd values as low as ~30 pM. The approach presented here is well suited for the routine production of high-affinity capture reagents for various biomedical applications.

        "text": "In the present work electrically conductive, flexible, lightweight carbon sponge materials derived from open-pore structure melamine foams are studied and explored. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface properties - depending on the chosen treatment conditions - allow the separation and storage of liquid chemical compounds. Activation of the carbonaceous structures substantially increases the specific surface area from ~4 m2g−1 to ~345 m2g−1, while retaining the original three-dimensional, open-pore structure suitable for hosting, for example, Ni catalyst nanoparticles. In turn the structure is rendered suitable for hydrogenating acetone to 2-propanol and methyl isobutyl ketone as well for growing hierarchical carbon nanotube structures used as electric double-layer capacitor electrodes with specific capacitance of ~40 F/g. Mechanical stress-strain analysis indicates the materials are super-compressible (>70% volume reduction) and viscoelastic with excellent damping behavior (loss of 0.69 ± 0.07), while piezoresistive measurements show very high gauge factors (from ~20 to 50) over a large range of deformations. The cost-effective, robust and scalable synthesis - in conjunction with their fascinating multifunctional utility - makes the demonstrated carbon foams remarkable competitors with other three-dimensional carbon materials typically based on pyrolyzed biopolymers or on covalently bonded graphene and carbon nanotube frameworks.

The Mott metal\u2013insulator transition3, a phenomenon that is central to many investigations of strongly correlated electrons, is also supposed to be quantum critical, although this has so far not been demonstrated experimentally. Here, we report experimental evidence for the quantum-critical nature of the Mott instability, obtained by investigating the electron transport of three organic systems with different ground states under continuously controlled pressure. The resistivity obeys the material-independent quantum-critical scaling relation bifurcating into a Fermi liquid or Mott insulator, irrespective of the ground states.

More than 10-fold enhancement of SERS is observed from the double-shelled nanoboxes than Ag nanocubes.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information Given their high theoretical specific energy, lithium\u2013oxygen batteries have received enormous attention as possible alternatives to current state-of-the-art rechargeable Li\u2013ion batteries. However, the maximum discharge capacity in non-aqueous lithium\u2013oxygen batteries is limited to a small fraction of its theoretical value due to the build-up of insulating \u200blithium peroxide (\u200bLi2O2), the battery\u2019s primary discharge product. The discharge capacity can be increased if \u200bLi2O2 forms as large toroidal particles rather than as a thin conformal layer. Here, we show that trace amounts of electrolyte additives, such as \u200bH2O, enhance the formation of \u200bLi2O2 toroids and result in significant improvements in capacity. Our experimental observations and a growth model show that the solvating properties of the additives prompt a solution-based mechanism that is responsible for the growth of \u200bLi2O2 toroids. We present a general formalism describing an additive\u2019s tendency to trigger the solution process, providing a rational design route for electrolytes that afford larger lithium\u2013oxygen battery capacities. At a glance Figures Figure 1: \u200bLi2O2 discharge product morphology control. a\u2013f, SEM images of a Vulcan XC72 carbon cathode without any discharge (a) and of similar cathodes discharged to a capacity of 1 mAh at a rate of 50 µA using nominally anhydrous (LiTFSI in \u200bDME as the electrolyte (b) and with \u200bwater contents of 500 ppm (c), 1,000 ppm (d), 2,000 ppm (e) and 4,000 ppm (f) in the electrolyte. The size of the \u200bLi2O2 toroids increases with the amount of \u200bwater in the electrolyte. The thin platelets observed in d and f probably increase in size and number of layers to form toroids. All scale bars, 1 µm. Figure 2: Discharge capacity increase with increasing \u200bwater content in the electrolyte. a, Experimental gravimetric discharge capacities for batteries with XC72 carbon cathodes and 1 M \u200bLiTFSI in \u200bDME with varying \u200bwater content in the battery electrolyte. The experimental discharge capacities were obtained from galvanostatic discharges to a reductive potential of 2.3 V (versus \u200bLi/Li+) at a discharge rate of 250 µA. Error bars represent uncentainty in the gravimetric capacity calculation and are computed from the standard deviation of \u200bcarbon loading in the cathodes. b, Theoretically predicted discharge capacities from the developed electrochemical model. A cathode surface area of ~200 cm2 was assumed for the capacity calculation. The model predicts an approximately fivefold enhancement due to the addition of \u200bwater through triggering of the solution mechanism. Dotted lines are guides to the eye. Figure 3: Ex situ XRD measurements on discharged cathodes. a, θ −2θ X-ray diffractograms near the \u200bLi2O2 (100) and (101) resonance peaks on P50 \u200bcarbon cathodes discharged at a rate of 250 µA in cells using 1 M \u200bLiTFSI in \u200bDME with varying \u200bwater contents (shown in the Legend) as electrolytes. The diffractograms show a strong narrowing of the (100) and (101) peaks with increased \u200bwater content in the electrolyte, which is consistent with the increasing \u200bLi2O2 crystallite size evident from the SEM images in Fig. 1. b, Similar diffractograms collected on cathodes discharged at different discharge rates (shown in the legend) using the nominally anhydrous 1 M \u200bLiTFSI in \u200bDME electrolyte. No changes in peak width were observed, even with a nearly two orders of magnitude change in the discharge current. This suggests that the \u200bLi2O2 remains crystalline and the changes in crystallite size, if any, are below the instrumental resolution in all samples discharged under anhydrous conditions, irrespective of the discharge rate. All cathodes were discharged to a discharge capacity of 2 mAh and all the curves are normalized to the \u200bcarbon cathode's (002) XRD peak (not shown). Figure 4: The two pathways for \u200bLi2O2 formation. a,b, Discharge LSVs performed at 0.05 mV s−1 with a Vulcan XC72 carbon cathode and \u200blithium anode using 1 M \u200bLiTFSI based electrolyte solutions in nominally anhydrous \u200bDME (a) and \u200bDME with 4,000 ppm \u200bwater (b). The anhydrous \u200bDME sample shows a single sharp peak in the LSV at ~2.5 V, whereas the LSV curve for the cell with 4,000 ppm \u200bwater exhibits a distinct second peak at ~2.3 V. We attribute the first peak to surface electrochemical growth of \u200bLi2O2 and the second peak to the solution-mediated growth of \u200bLi2O2, where \u200bO2− acts as a redox mediator. c, Theoretically predicted discharge LSV curves for the two independent mechanisms using the developed electrochemical model. The peak currents and the relative potential differences between the two peaks from theory are in good agreement with experiment. The differences in the absolute potentials from theory and experiment could be due to the cell impedance, which is not subtracted from the experimental LSV curves. Figure 5: Proposed mechanism for the growth of \u200bLi2O2 toroids in the presence of \u200bwater. a, The deposition of \u200bLi2O2 in a Li\u2013O2 cell is shown schematically to proceed via a surface electrochemical growth process that occurs on a nucleated film of \u200bLi2O2 through the sequential transfer of solvated Li+ (Li+(sol)) and an electron (e−) to the intermediate species LiO2*, and eventually forming \u200bLi2O2. The electron must therefore tunnel through the nucleated \u200bLi2O2 film as indicated, and this process is limited by the electronic conductivity of \u200bLi2O2. The presence of a solvent (\u200bwater in our experiments) that solvates LiO2* to Li+(sol) and solvated \u200bO2− (\u200bO2−(sol)) triggers a solution pathway leading to the growth of toroids, as shown schematically. \u200bO2−(sol) adsorbs as LiO2* on the growing toroidal particle, ultimately disproportionating to form \u200bLi2O2. Thus, \u200bO2−(sol) acts as a redox shuttle and leads to the formation of large particles, thereby circumventing the conductivity limitations in the surface electrochemical growth. b,c, \u200bLi2O2 toroidal particle size predicted by the particle growth model for an electrolyte containing 1,000 ppm of \u200bwater (b) and 4,000 ppm of \u200bwater (c). Larger-sized discharge products are observed at higher \u200bwater contents, consistent with the experimental observations. Figure 6: Quantitative basis for solvent selection for high-capacity Li\u2013O2 batteries. The free energy of dissolution for LiO2* into Li+(sol) and \u200bO2−(sol) in different solvents as a function of the Gutman acceptor and donor numbers (AN and DN). The free energy plot is normalized relative to that of pure \u200bDME. \u200bDimethyl formamide (\u200bDMF), \u200bdimethyl acetamide (\u200bDMAc) and \u200bdimethyl sulfoxide (\u200bDMSO) have high DNs and are thus capable of stabilizing Li+. Water and \u200bmethanol, on the other hand, have high ANs and thus stabilize \u200bO2−. We predict that solvents that fall in the top-right quadrant of this plot will favour solution-mediated deposition of \u200bLi2O2, which will be essential for high-capacity Li\u2013O2 batteries.

        "text": "Exceptional properties of graphene have triggered intensive research on other 2D materials. Surface plasmon is another subject being actively explored for many applications. Herein we report a new class of core-shell nanostructure in which the shell is made of a 2D material for effective plasmonic propagation. We have designed a much enhanced chemical sensor made of plasmonic Agx@(2D-WO3) that combines above advantages. Specifically, the sensor response increases from 38 for Agx-WO3 mixture to 217 for the Agx@(2D-WO3) core-shell structure; response and recovery time are shortened considerably to 2 and 5 seconds; and optimum sensor working temperature is lowered from 370°C to 340°C. Light irradiation is found to increase the Agx@(2D-WO3) sensor response, particularly at blue wavelength where it resonates with the absorption of Ag nanoparticles. Raman scattering shows significantly enhanced intensity for both the 2D-WO3 shell and surface adsorbates. Both the resonance sensor enhancement and the Raman suggest that the improved sensor performance is due to nanoplasmonic mechanism. It is demonstrated that (1) 2D material can be used as the shell component of a core-shell nanostructure, and (2) surface plasmon can effectively boost sensor performance.

        "text": "Filamentous actin (F-actin) is the major protein of muscle thin filaments, and actin microfilaments are the main component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. Mutations in different actin isoforms lead to early-onset autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss1, familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections2, and multiple variations of myopathies3. In striated muscle fibres, the binding of myosin motors to actin filaments is mainly regulated by tropomyosin and troponin4, 5. Tropomyosin also binds to F-actin in smooth muscle and in non-muscle cells and stabilizes and regulates the filaments there in the absence of troponin6. Although crystal structures for monomeric actin (G-actin) are available7, a high-resolution structure of F-actin is still missing, hampering our understanding of how disease-causing mutations affect the function of thin muscle filaments and microfilaments. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of F-actin at a resolution of 3.7 Å in complex with tropomyosin at a resolution of 6.5 Å, determined by electron cryomicroscopy. The structure reveals that the D-loop is ordered and acts as a central region for hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions that stabilize the F-actin filament. We clearly identify map density corresponding to ADP and Mg2+ and explain the possible effect of prominent disease-causing mutants. A comparison of F-actin with G-actin reveals the conformational changes during filament formation and identifies the D-loop as their key mediator. We also confirm that negatively charged tropomyosin interacts with a positively charged groove on F-actin. Comparison of the position of tropomyosin in F-actin\u2013tropomyosin with its position in our previously determined F-actin\u2013tropomyosin\u2013myosin structure8 reveals a myosin-induced transition of tropomyosin. Our results allow us to understand the role of individual mutations in the genesis of actin- and tropomyosin-related diseases and will serve as a strong foundation for the targeted development of drugs.

The D-loop wraps around Y169 of the neighbouring subunit and other residues snugly fit into the groove formed by regions adjacent to the D-loop (c, d), resembling a lock-and-key interaction. In addition, a prominent hydrophobic patch in the D-loop interacts with a hydrophobic groove on the neighbouring F-actin subunit (e, f).

Thus, this destabilization of the intrastrand contact is connected to anomalous actin filament assembly and nemaline myopathies. Extended Data Fig. 5: Inter- and intrastrand F-actin interactions. a\u2013e, The interface at the plug involves three residues (R39, E270, D286) that form salt bridges and mediate not only one interstrand contact but also one intrastrand contact (see also Fig. 2a). In addition, the orientation of residues 264\u2013269 result in a negatively charged patch that electrostatically interacts with positively charged residues on the opposing actin. a, b, Front and back view of the interface at the plug, respectively. c\u2013e, Surface representations (front views in c and d, back view in e) depicting the Coulomb potential (ranging from −10 kcal mol−1 (red) to +10 kcal mol−1 (blue) at pH 7.5), indicating that the interaction of the upper region of the plug with adjacent inter- or intrastrand molecules is mediated by electrostatic interactions. f, Another interstrand contact is formed by residues 110\u2013115 of SD1 and residues 191\u2013199 of SD4 of the adjacent actin. However, no prominent electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions could be identified at this interface. Extended Data Fig. 6: Nucleotide binding site and intramolecular interactions. a, Table of identified intramolecular interactions that result in a stabilization of the nucleotide binding cleft, coordination of ADP and a divalent cation. Mutation data are from refs 3, 15, 23, 53, 54, 56, 57 and 60, 61, 62, 63, 64. b, Coordination of ADP and Ca2+ in the nucleotide binding cleft in G-actin (PDB accession code 3EL2; ref. 59). c\u2013e, Back views of the nucleotide binding cleft of F-actin (cyan) with bound ADP\u2013Mg2+ or ADP\u2013Ca2+ (c), ATP\u2013Ca2+ (d, relative position taken from PDB accession code 3EL2; ref. 59) and conformational changes between the G-actin-ATP and F-actin-ADP state (e). Glutamine 137 is moved closer to ADP, coordinating not only the cation (as in G-actin) but also the nucleotide β-phosphate (c). The presence of ATP instead of ADP in the nucleotide-binding site would be sterically unfavourable, suggesting that a different intermediate conformation exists for F-actin-ATP (d). The shorter distance of glutamine 137 to the γ-phosphate probably induces ATP hydrolysis and then afterwards the cation takes the position of the γ-phosphate in the ADP-state (e). For comparison the position of glutamine 137 in G-actin is shown in yellow and the transition from G-actin to F-actin is depicted by arrows. f, Mutation of glutamine 137 to histidine results in hampered coordination of the ion and the nucleotide and is connected to nemaline myopathies23. Extended Data Fig. 7: Model of barbed-end and pointed-end binding and G- to F-actin transition based on a comparison of start point (G-actin) and end point (F-actin). a, b, Binding of new G-actin (yellow, PDB accession code 3EL2; ref. 59) at the barbed end of F-actin (green) is initiated by the intrastrand binding of SD4 of G-actin to SD3 of F-actin (a, side view) and the interstrand binding of SD4 and SD1 (b, front view), respectively. G-actin is overlaid with a subunit of the structure found in F-actin (cyan). The main interstrand contacts are already present at the start of the transition and thereby guide the binding G-actin to its correct position, determining the symmetry of the filament. c, After initial binding the D-loop is trapped in the hydrophobic cleft of SD3 of F-actin and pulls on SD2. F-actin is depicted in surface representation (green). d, Finally, the SD2 and concomitantly SD1 are rotated and the final F-actin conformation is stabilized by various intramolecular interactions (see Figs 2c\u2013f and 3c\u2013f, Extended Data Fig. 6a). e, Owing to the relatively large distance from the SD1 and SD2 subdomains of the newly bound G-actin to the subunit of the opposite strand, the only influence of the opposite strand on the binding of G-actin is at the docking position of the D-loop. The transition of R39 illustrates well the docking of the D-loop. The residue is depicted in both states (G-actin and F-actin). f\u2013h, Binding of new G-actin (yellow, PDB accession code 3EL2; ref. 59) at the pointed end of F-actin (green) is initiated by initial intrastrand binding (g) of SD3 of G-actin to SD4 of F-actin at the pointed end and interstrand binding of SD4 to SD3 (h), respectively. Again, the main interstrand contacts are available before the transition of G-actin (yellow) to F-actin (SD1 and SD2 in cyan, SD3 and SD4 in red). i, During binding to F-actin the transition from G-actin to F-actin is initiated by an induced fit of the F-actin D-loop to the hydrophobic cleft of the newly bound G-actin. This leads to a pulling down of the central β-sheet of SD3 of G-actin. j, The β-sheet is thereby straightened and pushes up two adjacent helices of SD1. k, The slight dislocation of these helices is transmitted to other regions of SD1 and thereby emphasized. This leads to a global rotation of SD1, which results in a considerable rotation of SD2 by an angle of 20° and a closure of the nucleotide binding cleft (Fig. 3; see Supplementary Video 3). Extended Data Fig. 8: Tropomyosin binding and comparison of reconstructions regarding the tropomyosin position on F-actin. a, Table showing putative residues of F-actin involved in tropomyosin binding and known mutations. Mutation data are from refs 15 and 65. b\u2013e, Reconstructions of F-actin decorated with tropomyosin calculated from: the cryo-EM data set filtered to 15 Å (b), from a negatively stained data set (c), from a negatively stained data set after cross-linking with glutardialdehyde (d), and from negatively stained bare F-actin (e). f, By calculating a difference map between tropomyosin\u2013bare F-actin (blue) and glutardialdehyde\u2013bare F-actin (green), differences in the tropomyosin position on bare F-actin (grey) are visualized. g, Overlay of difference maps showing that the position of tropomyosin in the cryo-EM reconstruction (yellow) corresponds to the tropomyosin position of the negatively stained data set with the cross-linked complex (green). h, Surface of F-actin and tropomyosin (pseudo-repeats 2\u20136) with the electrostatic Coulomb potentials at pH 7.5 and pH 4, ranging from −10 kcal mol−1 (red) to +10 kcal mol−1 (blue) (see also Fig. 4b). Tropomyosin was rotated by 180° and shifted to the right to allow a better view of the F-actin\u2013tropomyosin interface. Difference maps of the glutardialdehyde\u2013bare F-actin and the tropomyosin\u2013bare F-actin map are shown on the F-actin surface at pH 7.5 (left) and pH 4.0 (middle), respectively.

Most of the myosin binding sites on F-actin are not occupied by tropomyosin and only loop 4 and the cardiomyopathy loop are sterically hindered from binding to the F-actin filament (b). Actin-induced closure of the 50-kDa cleft of myosin (c) results in a strong binding of myosin and tropomyosin moves to its M-state position (blue) (d). e\u2013g, F-actin\u2013tropomyosin\u2013myosin complex in the rigor state (PDB accession code 4A7H; ref. 8). Myosin is shown in red. h\u2013l, There are two possible ways for the transition of tropomyosin from the A-state to the M-state. Tropomyosin either rolls (i, j) or slides (k, l) from one to the other position. Rolling would involve an azimuthal rotation of ~16° with respect to the F-actin axis (inset of j) and a left-handed rotation of ~70° (indicated by solid arrows) or a right-handed rotation of ~110° (indicated by dotted arrows) with respect to its own axis (i, j). Sliding would imply not only an azimuthal shift of ~12 Å (indicated by white arrows in k), but also a tremendous shift of a half-tropomyosin repeat (that is, ~35 Å) along the F-actin filament (k, l). The radius to the filament axis would be preserved in both situations. The inset of l depicts the vectors for a shifting transition of tropomyosin: an azimuthal and longitudinal shift of 12 Å and 35 Å, resulting in an overall shift of 37 Å.

        "text": "We report the strong experimental evidence of the existence of topological surface states with large electric field tunability and mobility in β-Ag2Te. Pronounced 2D Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations have been observed in β-Ag2Te nanoplates. A Berry phase is determined to be near π using the Landau level fan diagram for a relatively wide nanoplate while the largest electric field ambipolar effect in topological insulator so far (~2500%) is observed in a narrow nanoplate. The π Berry phase and the evolution of quantum oscillations with gate voltage (Vg) in the nanoplates strongly indicate the presence of topological surface states in β-Ag2Te. Moreover, the mobility of the narrow Ag2Te nanoplate is about several thousand cm2s−1V−1.

        "text": "The nanoscale imaging of charge flow in proteins is crucial to understanding several life processes, including respiration, metabolism and photosynthesis1, 2, 3. However, existing imaging methods are only effective under non-physiological conditions or are limited to photosynthetic proteins1. Here, we show that electrostatic force microscopy can be used to directly visualize charge propagation along pili of Geobacter sulfurreducens with nanometre resolution and under ambient conditions. Charges injected at a single point into individual, untreated pili, which are still attached to cells, propagated over the entire filament. The mobile charge density in the pili, as well as the temperature and pH dependence of the charge density, were similar to those of carbon nanotubes4 and other organic conductors5, 6, 7. These findings, coupled with a lack of charge propagation in mutated pili that were missing key aromatic amino acids8, suggest that the pili of G. sulfurreducens function as molecular wires with transport via delocalized charges, rather than the hopping mechanism that is typical of biological electron transport2, 3, 9. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Strategy for direct visualization of charge propagation along native bacterial proteins with ambient EFM. a, TEM image of cells expressing pili and flagella filaments.

        "text": "By merging bottom-up and top-down strategies we tailor graphene's electronic properties within nanometer accuracy, which opens up the possibility to design optical and plasmonic circuitries at will. In a first step, graphene electronic properties are macroscopically modified exploiting the periodic potential generated by the self assembly of metal cluster superlattices on a graphene/Ir(111) surface. We then demonstrate that individual metal clusters can be selectively removed by a STM tip with perfect reproducibility and that the structures so created are stable even at room temperature. This enables one to nanopattern circuits down to the 2.5 nm only limited by the periodicity of the Moiré-pattern, i.e., by the distance between neighbouring clusters, and different electronic and optical properties should prevail in the covered and uncovered regions.

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses confirmed that Co3O4 nanocrystals were homogeneously distributed on both sides of graphene nanosheets. The obtained composite shows enhanced catalytic activities in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes. The onset potential towards the oxygen evolution reaction is 0.406 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 1 M KOH solution, and 0.858 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in neutral phosphate buffer solution (PBS), respectively. The current density of 10 mA/cm2 has been achieved at the overpotential of 313 mV in 1 M KOH and 498 mV in PBS. The graphene-Co3O4 composite also exhibited an excellent stability in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes. In particular, no obvious current density decay was observed after 10 hours testing in alkaline solution and the morphology of the material was well maintained, which could be ascribed to the synergistic effect of combining Co3O4 and graphene.

        "text": "Cooper pairs in the superconductor are a natural source of spin entanglement. The existing proposals of the Cooper pair splitter can only realize a low efficiency of entanglement production, and its size is constrained by the superconducting coherence length. Here we show that a long-range Cooper pair splitter can be implemented in a normal metal-superconductor-normal metal (NSN) junction by driving a supercurrent in the S. The supercurrent results in a band gap modification of the S, which significantly enhances the crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) of the NSN junction and simultaneously quenches its elastic cotunneling. Therefore, a high entanglement production rate close to its saturation value can be achieved by the inverse CAR. Interestingly, in addition to the conventional entangled electron states between opposite energy levels, novel entangled states with equal energy can also be induced in our proposal.

        "text": "The anisotropic Rabi model, which was proposed recently, differs from the original Rabi model: the rotating and counter-rotating terms are governed by two different coupling constants. This feature allows us to vary the counter-rotating interaction independently and explore the effects of it on some quantum properties. In this paper, we eliminate the counter-rotating terms approximately and obtain the analytical energy spectrums and wavefunctions. These analytical results agree well with the numerical calculations in a wide range of the parameters including the ultrastrong coupling regime. In the weak counter-rotating coupling limit we find out that the counter-rotating terms can be considered as the shifts to the parameters of the Jaynes-Cummings model. This modification shows the validness of the rotating-wave approximation on the assumption of near-resonance and relatively weak coupling. Moreover, the analytical expressions of several physics quantities are also derived, and the results show the break-down of the U(1)-symmetry and the deviation from the Jaynes-Cummings model.

Phonon optics experiments with coherent terahertz and sub-terahertz phonons promise a revolution in various technical applications related to high-frequency acoustics, imaging, and heat transport. Previously, phonon optics used passive methods for manipulations with propagating phonon beams that did not enable their external control. Here we fabricate a phononic chip, which includes a generator of coherent monochromatic phonons with frequency 378 GHz, a sensitive coherent phonon detector, and an active layer: a doped semiconductor superlattice, with electrical contacts, inserted into the phonon propagation path. In the experiments, we demonstrate the modulation of the coherent phonon flux by an external electrical bias applied to the active layer.

Similar with MoS2, few-layer WS2 has remarkable physical properties. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that WS2 nanosheets exhibit ultrafast nonlinear saturable absorption property and high optical damage threshold. Soliton mode-locking operations are achieved separately in an erbium-doped fiber laser using two types of WS2-based saturable absorbers, one of which is fabricated by depositing WS2 nanosheets on a D-shaped fiber, while the other is synthesized by mixing WS2 solution with polyvinyl alcohol, and then evaporating them on a substrate. At the maximum pump power of 600 mW, two saturable absorbers can work stably at mode-locking state without damage, indicating that few-layer WS2 is a promising high-power flexible saturable absorber for ultrafast optics.

While in general the metallic LaNiO3 film can effectively screen this polarity mismatch, we establish that in the ultra-thin limit, films are insulating in nature and require additional chemical and structural reconstruction to compensate for such mismatch. A combination of in-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction recorded during the growth, X-ray diffraction, and synchrotron based resonant X-ray spectroscopy reveal the formation of a chemical phase La2Ni2O5 (Ni2+) for a few unit-cell thick films. First-principles layer-resolved calculations of the potential energy across the nominal LaNiO3/SrTiO3 interface confirm that the oxygen vacancies can efficiently reduce the electric field at the interface.

Here, we report a novel paradigm for controlled nucleation and growth of scrolled and folded shapes in finite-length nanoribbons. All-atom computations on graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and experiments on macroscale magnetic thin films reveal that decreasing the end distance of torsionally constrained ribbons below their contour length leads to formation of these shapes. The energy partitioning between twisted and bent shapes is modified in favor of these densely packed soft conformations due to the non-local van der Waals interactions in these 2D crystals; they subvert the formation of supercoils that are seen in their natural counterparts such as DNA and filamentous proteins. The conformational phase diagram is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information Electromagnetically induced transparency provides a powerful mechanism for controlling light propagation in a dielectric medium, and for producing slow and fast light. Electromagnetically induced transparency traditionally arises from destructive interference induced by a non-radiative coherence in an atomic system. Stimulated Brillouin scattering of light from propagating hypersonic acoustic waves has also been used successfully for the generation of slow and fast light. However, Electromagnetically induced transparency-type processes based on stimulated Brillouin scattering were considered infeasible because of the short coherence lifetime of hypersonic phonons. Here, we report a new Brillouin scattering induced transparency phenomenon generated by acousto-optic interaction of light with long-lived propagating phonons in a silica resonator. We demonstrate that Brillouin scattering induced transparency is uniquely non-reciprocal owing to the propagating acoustic wave and accompanying momentum conservation requirement. We also show that Brillouin scattering induced transparency enables ultralow-power ultralow-footprint slow-light generation with delay-bandwidth product comparable to state-of-the-art stimulated Brillouin scattering systems. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Theoretical description of BSIT. a, Brillouin phase matching requires two optical modes of a system that are separated by the acoustic parameters in ω\u2013k space. b, In a BSIT experiment, control and probe lasers are coupled to phase-matched optical whispering gallery modes of a resonator by means of a tapered optical fibre. A forward-SBS opto-acoustic interaction takes place within the resonator. c, The control laser pumps the lower frequency optical mode to allow anti-Stokes scattering while the resonator suppresses Stokes scattering25. Bottom: a probe laser scans through the optical resonances, visible as a drop in waveguide transmission35. Top: from traditional SBS theory4 anti-Stokes absorption is predicted for a probe signal at ωp = ωc + ΩB, which should intuitively increase the probe loss. However, when (ΩB, qB) represent a long-lived phonon mode, a transparency is observed owing to interference between probe excitation pathways. The κi represent the respective dissipation rates of the two optical modes. Figure 2: Experimental set-up for BSIT. We use a fibre-coupled external cavity diode laser (ECDL) to generate both control and probe signals through an electro-optic modulator (EOM), with the probe frequency separation set by a network analyser. A fibre taper is used to couple the light in and out of the microsphere resonator. The spectrum analyser monitors spontaneous scattering while the network analyser measures the probe transmission. PD, photodetector. FPC, fibre polarization controller. Figure 3: Observation of BSIT and slow light. a, Brillouin scattering analogue of EIT\u2019s three-level lambda system. Setting probe photon population np and phonon population nm, we can describe the states as |1 = |np, nm, |e = |np + 1, nm, and |2 = |np, nm + 1. b, We map resonator optical modes with a swept frequency laser. c, When we pump the (ω2, k2) mode with a strong laser source, a Stokes SBS laser is generated24. When the Stokes scattered and pump light are interfered on a photodetector, a beat note corresponding to their frequency difference, ΩB, is measured. The lack of harmonics of ΩB indicates that this is not a radiation pressure induced optomechanical oscillation. d, Transparency is observed for a probe on (ω2, k2) when a strong pump is placed at (ω1, k1). The solid blue line is the probe laser amplitude response. The red dashed curve is a fit to the (ω2, k2) optical mode. e, Probe phase response indicates slow-light response within the transparency. f, Additional probe group delay Δt = dϕ/dω to be compared to the transmission time without BSIT. 1 mW of laser power is used to generate a time delay of 110 μs. Figure 4: Observation of Brillouin scattering induced opacity and fast light. a, The control laser pumps the (ω2, k2) optical mode while the probe measures the lower frequency mode, (ω1, k1). b, We map the optical modes with a swept frequency laser. c, When a laser pumps (ω2, k2) above threshold (as in Fig. 3), forward-SBS lasing results. d, In the configuration shown in a, the probe experiences an opacity at ΩB offset from the control laser. The solid blue line is the amplitude response of the probe laser. The red dashed curve is a fit to the (ω1, k1) optical mode. e, A negative slope in the probe phase corresponds to a fast-light response within the opacity region. f, Probe time advancement compared to the transmission time without Brillouin scattering induced opacity. Time advancement of 35 μs is demonstrated using a control laser power of 380 μW. Figure 5: Demonstration of non-reciprocity in BSIT. a, Transparency is induced in the anti-Stokes optical mode for a forward-propagating probe signal in a Brillouin coupled system. b, There is no transparency observed when the optical probe signal is switched to the backward direction. The background noise and asymmetries are created as a result of Fabry\u2013Perot resonances in the differing forward and backward fibre propagation pathways, and the transfer functions of the two different electro-optic modulators used for the experiment.

        "text": "Biocompatible surfaces hold key to a variety of biomedical problems that are directly related to the competition between host-tissue cell integration and bacterial colonisation. A saving solution to this is seen in the ability of cells to uniquely respond to physical cues on such surfaces thus prompting the search for cell-instructive nanoscale patterns. Here we introduce a generic rationale engineered into biocompatible, titanium, substrates to differentiate cell responses. The rationale is inspired by cicada wing surfaces that display bactericidal nanopillar patterns. The surfaces engineered in this study are titania (TiO2) nanowire arrays that are selectively bactericidal against motile bacteria, while capable of guiding mammalian cell proliferation according to the type of the array.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information A fundamental and unconventional characteristic of superconductivity in iron-based materials is that it occurs in the vicinity of two other instabilities. In addition to a tendency towards magnetic order, these Fe-based systems have a propensity for nematic ordering: a lowering of the rotational symmetry while time-reversal invariance is preserved. Setting the stage for superconductivity, it is heavily debated whether the nematic symmetry breaking is driven by lattice, orbital or spin degrees of freedom. Here, we report a very clear splitting of NMR resonance lines in \u200bFeSe at Tnem = 91 K, far above the superconducting Tc of 9.3 K. The splitting occurs for magnetic fields perpendicular to the Fe planes and has the temperature dependence of a Landau-type order parameter. Spin\u2013lattice relaxation rates are not affected at Tnem, which unequivocally establishes orbital degrees of freedom as driving the nematic order. We demonstrate that superconductivity competes with the emerging nematicity. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Schematic crystallographic structure of \u200bFeSe. a,b, Fe\u2013Se layers stacked along the c direction (a) and the in-plane Fe atoms forming an almost square lattice with Se atoms centred alternatively above and below Fe4 plaquettes (b). Figure 2: 77Se NMR spectra for the \u200bFeSe single crystal. a, Measured at a field of 9 T applied parallel to either the crystallographic a axis or c axis, as a function of temperature. The 77Se line splits into two lines (l1 and l2) at Tnem = 91 K for H ∥ a, whereas the line l3 forH ∥ c remains narrow at all temperatures. To avoid an overlap, the spectra for H ∥ c are offset by −10 kHz. b, For an in-plane magnetic field where H ∥ [110]. The absence of the line splitting for this field orientation is direct proof for a breaking of the local four-fold rotational symmetry. The broadening of the line is attributed to the strain induced by glueing this crystal inside the NMR coil. Figure 3: Emergence of orbital-driven nematic state in \u200bFeSe. a, Temperature dependence of the 77Se NMR Knight shift for fields ∥a and ∥c. Whereas at Tnem, ∥a splits into lines l1 and l2, both ∥c and ∥aav, the average position of lines l1 and l2, show a smooth T-dependence. b, Temperature dependence of the l1\u2013l2 line splitting below Tnem in terms of the difference in Knight shift Δ ∥a. Insets: (upper right) below Tnem the splitting Δ ∥a is proportional to , as is expected for an order parameter at a second-order phase transition; (lower left) the comparison of two 77Se spectra at 10 K (> Tc) and 4.5 K (< Tc) reveals that the splitting between the l1 and l2 lines clearly decreases in the superconducting state. The intensities of two spectra were normalized for comparison. c, Temperature dependence of the spin\u2013lattice relaxation rate divided by T, (T1T)−1. The error bars reflect the uncertainty in the fitting procedure. At around Tnem the spin-relaxation rate barely changes, indicating the absence of a magnetic instability. Approaching Tc enhances(T1T)−1, signalling that AFM spin fluctuations develop. Below Tc, as is conventional in the superconducting state, (T1T)−1 strongly drops. The inset shows an enlargement of the low-temperature regime. Figure 4: Top view of the FOO in \u200bFeSe with the two different domains that are present in a twinned crystal.

        "text": "During liquid evaporation, the equations for the vapor concentration in the atmosphere and for the temperature in the liquid are coupled and must be solved in an iterative manner. In the present paper, a combined field approach which unifies the coupled fields into one single hybrid field and thus makes the iteration unnecessary is proposed. By using this approach, the influences of the evaporative cooling on the evaporation of pinned sessile droplets are investigated, and its predictions are found in good agreement with the previous theoretical and experimental results. A dimensionless number Ec which can evaluate the strength of the evaporative cooling is then introduced, and the results show that both the evaporation flux along the droplet surface and the total evaporation rate of the droplet decrease as the evaporative cooling number Ec increases. For drying droplets, there exists a critical value EcCrit below which the evaporative cooling effect can be neglected and above which the significance of the effect increases dramatically. The present work may also have more general applications to coupled field problems in which all the fields have the same governing equation.

        "text": "We design a novel long-range hybrid wedge plasmonic (LRHWP) waveguide composed of two identical dielectric nanowires symmetrically placed on two opposed wedges of a diamond shaped metal wire. With strong coupling between the dielectric nanowire mode and long-range surface plasmon polariton (SPP) mode, both deep subwavelength mode confinement and low propagation loss are achieved. On one hand, when compared to the previous long-range hybrid SPP waveguide, LRHWP waveguide can achieve smaller mode size with similar propagation length; on the other hand, when compared to the previous hybrid wedge SPP waveguide, LRHWP waveguide can provide an order of magnitude longer propagation length with similar level of mode confinement. The designed LRHWP waveguide also features an overall advantage of one-order improvement of Figure of Merit. We further evaluate in detail the impacts of possible practical fabrication imperfections on the mode properties. The obtained results of mode properties show that the proposed LRHWP waveguide with an optimized wedge tip angle of 140 degree is fairly tolerant to practical fabrication errors in geometry parameters such as misalignment in the horizontal direction, asymmetry in the vertical direction, variation of wedge tip angle, tilt or rotation of metal wire, and variation of wedge tip curvature radius.

        "text": "Finding the ground states of the Ising Hamiltonian1 maps to various combinatorial optimization problems in biology, medicine, wireless communications, artificial intelligence and social network. So far, no efficient classical and quantum algorithm is known for these problems and intensive research is focused on creating physical systems\u2014Ising machines\u2014capable of finding the absolute or approximate ground states of the Ising Hamiltonian2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Here, we report an Ising machine using a network of degenerate optical parametric oscillators (OPOs). Spins are represented with above-threshold binary phases of the OPOs and the Ising couplings are realized by mutual injections7. The network is implemented in a single OPO ring cavity with multiple trains of femtosecond pulses and configurable mutual couplings, and operates at room temperature. We programmed a small non-deterministic polynomial time-hard problem on a 4-OPO Ising machine and in 1,000 runs no computational error was detected. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Principle of operation of OPO Ising machine. a, Simplified illustration of vacuum squeezing in a degenerate OPO below threshold and the binary phase states above threshold shown in in-phase and quadrature-phase coordinates. b, Gradual pumping of the OPO network to find the ground states. The parametric gain is gradually increased from below threshold to reach the minimum loss of the ground state. Because the lowest loss of the network corresponds to the phase-state configuration representing the answer to the Ising problem, it is expected that only the ground state oscillates. c, Comparison of the search mechanism in the OPO network, classical simulated annealing and quantum annealing. Figure 2: Experimental set-up. a, A 4-OPO system is pumped by a femtosecond fibre laser at 1,045 nm, three delay lines provide couplings between the OPOs, and an unequal-arm Michelson interferometer measures the relative phase states of adjacent OPOs. A chopper (CP) restarts the OPO system periodically with a clock rate of ∼1 kHz and a rise time (10\u201390% power) of ∼180 µs. Output couplers (OCs) and input couplers (ICs) provide ∼4% of power reflection (varying between 2 and 6%). The nonlinear crystal is periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN). b, Illustration of the output pulse train and the time slots assigned to OPO1 to OPO4. The repetition period of the pump and the OPO output (TR) is 4 ns and the cavity roundtrip time (Tcavity) is 16 ns. c, Illustration of couplings provided by different delay lines. Each delay line provides four couplings, that is, two-body interactions, among the temporally separated OPOs. Delay 1 couples OPOn to OPOn+1 (J12, J23, J34, J41), delay 2 couples OPOn to OPOn+2 (J13, J24, J31, J42), and delay 3 couples OPOn to OPOn+3 (J14, J21, J32, J43). Figure 3: Slow detector results. a, All delay lines are blocked. The output is randomly at one of the three discrete intensity levels 0, Im/2 or Im. The zero intensity level is slightly above the noise floor mainly because the arms of the interferometer have different lengths and so the interfering beams are not completely overlapping. b, Only delay 1 is present and its phase is scanned slowly. Around zero, where the coupling is in phase, the output locks to Im, verifying that all OPOs are in the same phase states. Around 180°, where the coupling is out of phase, the output locks at 0, verifying that adjacent OPOs have opposite phase states. The three-state output around 90° shows the inefficiency of coupling at those phases. Regenerative behaviour due to the phase-sensitive amplification of the OPO is observed, for example, for the coupling phases between −30 and 30° and between 150 and 210°. c, All the delays are present and their phases are locked to 180° to represent the MAX-CUT problem, where the output toggles between 0 and Im/2. a.u., arbitrary units. Figure 4: Fast detector results. a, Samples of the pulse patterns at the output of the interferometer. Each time the system is pumped above threshold, depending on the network configuration, one of these patterns is detected with a fast detector at the output of the interferometer. a.u., arbitrary units. b, Histogram of the phase states when all couplings are blocked (that is, the OPOs are independent), for 1,000 runs. c, Histogram of the phase states when all delays are on and their phases are locked to π for 1,000 runs. The OPO network represents the MAX-CUT problem for a four-vertex graph, and it only oscillates in the phase states corresponding to the answers to this problem.

Further, the EL from QD-LEDs at sub-bandgap drive voltages is achieved, which is in contrast to the general device in which the turn-on voltage is generally equal to or greater than its bandgap voltage (the bandgap energy divided by the electron charge). This sub-bandgap EL is attributed to the Auger-assisted energy up-conversion hole-injection process at the QDs/organic interface. The high energy holes induced by Auger-assisted processes can be injected into the QDs at sub-bandgap applied voltages. These results are of important significance to deeply understand the EL mechanism in QD-LEDs and to further improve device performance.

        "text": "The transition between paramagnetism and ferromagnetism is the paradigm for a continuous phase transition at finite temperature. When such a transition is tuned to zero temperature in clean materials, the growth of low-energy zero-point fluctuations potentially drives an array of phenomena, including the formation of novel states such as non-conventional superconductivity. Experimentally, the growth of the fluctuations, however, is curtailed and the transition becomes discontinuous as its temperature is reduced. This is understood to arise from non-analytic corrections to the free energy that always occur1. In a recent theory2, 3, changes of the excitation spectrum are self-consistently considered alongside the ground state. This analysis reveals that a transition to a new state may be an alternative outcome. As the excitation spectrum (the \u2018disorder\u2019) is pivotal to promoting the new \u2018order\u2019 this mechanism is referred to as \u2018order by disorder\u2019. Here, we report the discovery of modulated order in PrPtAl, consistent with complex spirals, at the boundary between paramagnetism and ferromagnetism, giving the first clear experimental realization of such a state.

Figure 2: The magnetic structure of the SDW2 state consistent with the reported diffraction studies. The upper image shows the SDW2 state over a length of approximately 1/2 the modulation period. Only the Pr atoms are shown (spheres). These form chains running along the c-axis with different a-coordinate, zigzagging in the bc-plane. The moments are shown as arrows. There is an additional intra-cell canting that tilts the moments out of the plane of the shaded discs in the c-direction (in the opposite sense in the two chains), which for clarity is not shown. The lower two images show the same structure viewed from the a and b crystal directions.

        "text": "Gas separation membranes are one of the lowest energy technologies available for the separation of carbon dioxide from flue gas. Key to handling the immense scale of this separation is maximised membrane permeability at sufficient selectivity for CO2 over N2. For the first time it is revealed that metals can be post-synthetically exchanged in MOFs to drastically enhance gas transport performance in membranes. Ti-exchanged UiO-66 MOFs have been found to triple the gas permeability without a loss in selectivity due to several effects that include increased affinity for CO2 and stronger interactions between the polymer matrix and the Ti-MOFs. As a result, it is also shown that MOFs optimized in previous works for batch-wise adsorption applications can be applied to membranes, which have lower demands on material quantities. These membranes exhibit exceptional CO2 permeability enhancement of as much as 153% when compared to the non-exchanged UiO-66 mixed-matrix controls, which places them well above the Robeson upper bound at just a 5 wt.% loading. The fact that maximum permeability enhancement occurs at such low loadings, significantly less than the optimum for other MMMs, is a major advantage in large-scale application due to the more attainable quantities of MOF needed.

The structural characterization revealed that the ZnO\u2013CuO HNCs were composed of the ZnO and CuO mixed NWs trunk (~200 nm), whose outer surface was attached with small CuO nanoparticles (NPs). Moreover, a good synergetic effect between CuO and ZnO was confirmed. The nonenzymatic biosensing properties of as prepared 3D porous electrodes based on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) were studied and the results indicated that the sensing properties of 3D porous ZnO\u2013CuO HNCs electrodes were significantly improved and depended strongly on the thickness of the HNCs. At an applied potential of + 0.7 V, the optimum ZnO\u2013CuO HNCs electrode presented a high sensitivity of 3066.4 μAmM−1cm−2, the linear range up to 1.6 mM, and low practical detection limit of 0.21 μM. It also showed outstanding long term stability, good reproducibility, excellent selectivity and accurate measurement in real serum sample.

        "text": "Piezoelectricity allows precise and robust conversion between electricity and mechanical force, and arises from the broken inversion symmetry in the atomic structure1, 2, 3. Reducing the dimensionality of bulk materials has been suggested to enhance piezoelectricity4. However, when the thickness of a material approaches a single molecular layer, the large surface energy can cause piezoelectric structures to be thermodynamically unstable5. Transition-metal dichalcogenides can retain their atomic structures down to the single-layer limit without lattice reconstruction, even under ambient conditions6. Recent calculations have predicted the existence of piezoelectricity in these two-dimensional crystals due to their broken inversion symmetry7. Here, we report experimental evidence of piezoelectricity in a free-standing single layer of molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) and a measured piezoelectric coefficient of e11 = 2.9 × 10\u201310 C m−1. The measurement of the intrinsic piezoelectricity in such free-standing crystals is free from substrate effects such as doping and parasitic charges. We observed a finite and zero piezoelectric response in MoS2 in odd and even number of layers, respectively, in sharp contrast to bulk piezoelectric materials. This oscillation is due to the breaking and recovery of the inversion symmetry of the two-dimensional crystal. Through the angular dependence of electromechanical coupling, we determined the two-dimensional crystal orientation. The piezoelectricity discovered in this single molecular membrane promises new applications in low-power logic switches for computing and ultrasensitive biological sensors scaled down to a single atomic unit cell8, 9. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Probing the piezoelectric property of free-standing monolayer MoS2. a, A single layer of MoS2 consists of S\u2013Mo\u2013S stacking with a total thickness of 0.6 nm, with the Mo atom centred in the trigonal prism (bottom left). Viewing from the top (bottom right), each unit cell (denoted by the yellow shadow) consists of two S atoms occupying the same site in the hexagonal lattice, with the Mo atom residing in the opposite site, therefore breaking inversion symmetry in the x\u2013y plane but preserving mirror symmetry in the z direction (Supplementary Fig. 1). b, With an external electric field pointing from the S site to the Mo site, the Mo\u20132S dipole is stretched and the unit cell is elongated, creating compressive stress in the x direction and tensile stress in the y direction. c, To measure the in-plane piezoelectric stress, the MoS2 film was suspended on two HSQ posts, clamped underneath by two Au electrodes. The film was indented with a scanning AFM probe. The induced stress changed the load on the cantilever, which was observed by the deflection of a laser beam. Figure 2: Design and characterization of the piezoelectric monolayer MoS2 device. a, To maximize piezoelectric coupling, electrodes (outlined with yellow dashed lines) were defined parallel to the zigzag edges (white dashed lines, verified by SHG measurements) of the exfoliated monolayer flakes, identified by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The false colours of green and red denote the intensity of reflection and photoluminescence, respectively. Scale bar, 5 µm. b, The device was inspected by SEM to confirm that free-standing MoS2 monolayers were clamped between the Au electrodes and HSQ posts, patterned via one-step EBL. The clearance between film and substrate was large enough (>450 nm) to reduce the van der Waals force from the substrate during indentation. Scale bar, 1 µm. Figure 3: Measuring the piezoelectric coefficient through nano-indentation and electromechanical actuation. a, The mechanical properties of MoS2 membranes without an electric field are characterized by the load\u2013indentation dependence (black scatter). The vertical load exhibits a cubic dependence on indentation depth described by linear elastic membrane theory ( equation (2)). The Young's modulus (Y2D = 1.2 × 102 N m−1) of monolayer MoS2 retrieved from a polynomial fitting curve (red) was in good agreement with previous studies. The load curve also provides an effective spring constant of the film as a function of depth. b, Piezoelectrically induced load (ΔFp) on the tip at fixed driving voltage (V = 1 V) measured as a function of depth of indentation (black scatter). The slope of the fitting curve (red) is the scalar piezoelectric stress (Δσp = 0.12 mN m−1) according to equation (3). ΔFp was derived from the stiffness of the tip/film assembly multiplied by the change of tip deflection Δz directly measured with a lock-in amplifier. c, Piezoelectric stress measured at various driving voltage (black scatter) at a fixed depth of indentation shows a linear dependence. The error bars (standard uncertainty) are estimated from the noise level. The piezoelectric coefficient of monolayer e11 = 2.9 × 10−10 C m−1 was calculated from the slope of the fitting curve (red). Figure 4: Angular dependence of the piezoelectric response in monolayer MoS2. a, The rotation of the crystal with respect to the electric field and mechanical boundary was achieved by patterning the electrodes at different angles θ. b, Optical image of multiple electrode pairs integrated on a long stripe of MoS2 (dashed outline) rotated by 10° at each section. The relative rotation between the first and last device is 60°, so the piezoelectric effect should reverse sign as the alignment of the electric field to the Mo\u20132S dipole changes from parallel to antiparallel. Scale bar, 10 µm. c, Measured piezoelectric coupling strength (square data points) followed the cos 3θ dependence (the red fitting curve) predicted from the crystalline three-fold symmetry. The sign change was observed from the phase readout of the piezoelectric signal through a lock-in amplifier. This distinguished our low-frequency electric method from SHG (which typically only gives amplitude information), enabling the crystalline orientation (as shown in the inset of b) to be uniquely determined without resorting to atomic images. d, Measured piezoelectric coefficient in one-, two- and three-layer MoS2 membranes, showing that only odd numbers of layers exhibit a significant coupling strength due to their broken inversion symmetry. Error bars (standard uncertainty) in c and d were estimated from the noise level of the force measurement and variations in the device geometry.

        "text": "Thermal radiative emission from a hot surface to a cold surface plays an important role in many applications, including energy conversion, thermal management, lithography, data storage and thermal microscopy1, 2. Recent studies3, 4, 5 on bulk materials have confirmed long-standing theoretical predictions indicating that when the gap between the surfaces is reduced to tens of nanometres, well below the peak wavelength of the blackbody emission spectrum, the radiative heat flux increases by orders of magnitude. However, despite recent attempts6, whether such enhancements can be obtained in nanoscale dielectric films thinner than the penetration depth of thermal radiation, as suggested by theory, remains experimentally unknown. Here, using an experimental platform that comprises a heat-flow calorimeter with a resolution of about 100 pW (ref. 7), we experimentally demonstrate a dramatic increase in near-field radiative heat transfer, comparable to that obtained between bulk materials, even for very thin dielectric films (50\u2013100 nm) when the spatial separation between the hot and cold surfaces is comparable to the film thickness. We explain these results by analysing the spectral characteristics and mode shapes of surface phonon polaritons, which dominate near-field radiative heat transport in polar dielectric thin films. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Experimental set-up and devices. a, Schematic of the experimental set-up. The emitter consists of a suspended silicon platform, with an attached silica sphere and an integrated electrical heater\u2013thermometer. The receiver is a stiff silicon nitride platform coated with gold and a silica film of suitably chosen thickness. A laser (reflected off the receiver, see also e) and a position-sensitive detector (PSD) enable optical detection of emitter\u2013receiver contact formation with nanometre resolution. A sinusoidal electrical current (If,in = If,out), at f = 1 Hz, is supplied to the emitter's resistor, resulting in Joule heating with amplitude Qjoule,2f and frequency 2 Hz. This is partly conducted through the beams (Qcon,2f) and partly radiated to the emitter (Qrad,2f). The emitter's temperature oscillations are quantified by measuring the third harmonic of the voltage (V3f) across the resistor. The receiver's temperature oscillations are measured by supplying a dc current (Idc,in = Idc,out) through the receiver's resistor and by monitoring the voltage output at 2f (V2f) across it. Ta is the ambient temperature. b, Schematic cross-section of the planar receiver region and the spherical silica emitter. The gold layer is ∼100 nm thick, and the thickness t of the SiO2 film varies from 50 nm to 3 µm for different receiver devices. c, Scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the suspended platform and optical image (inset) of the spherical emitter. d, SEM images of the receiver show ribbed beams and suspended regions. e, Optical image of the emitter and receiver during alignment. In this image the devices were laterally displaced to enable simultaneous visualization. Figure 2: Gap-dependent near-field thermal conductance of thin films. a, Simultaneous recording of displacement, Δz, of the emitter towards the receiver (top), optical contact signal (middle) and temperature increase in the receiver (bottom). During the final approach, piezo displacement steps of ∼2.5 nm were used. b, Contribution of far-field radiation to the radiative thermal conductance across the gap for a representative film (100 nm). The solid red line describes the predicted far-field radiation, which increases weakly (−1) with decreasing gap size due to the associated change in view factor. As expected, the measured data (multiple runs, green symbols) agree well with the far-field prediction for gaps from 1 to 10 µm. c, Near-field thermal conductance as a function of film thicknesses. Data for each film thickness represent an average of ∼10 different data sets. See Supplementary Fig. 7 for information about the standard deviation of the data. Figure 3: Computed heat transfer coefficients. a, Computed total heat transfer coefficient as a function of gap size for the multilayer system shown in the inset. This structure comprises a thick, semi-infinite silica surface separated by a vacuum gap of size d from a silica thin film coating on a semi-infinite Au surface. Different curves correspond to different thicknesses of the silica coating. b, Calculated near-field conductance as a function of gap size for the sphere and coated layer system shown in the inset. The sphere has a diameter of 53 µm and the SiO2\u2013Au structure is assumed to be infinite in the transverse directions. Different curves correspond to different values of coating thickness. These results were obtained using the data in a, within the Derjaguin approximation (see Methods and Supplementary Information) and by subtracting the far-field contribution to make a direct comparison with the experiments. In all calculations the temperature was assumed to be 300 K. Figure 4: Role of surface phonon polaritons in near-field radiative heat transfer. a, Spectral heat transfer coefficient for TE and TM modes as a function of radiation energy for the multilayer system in Fig. 3a with coating thicknesses of t = 100 nm (solid lines) and t = 3 µm (dashed lines) at a gap of 20 nm. The heat transfer is dominated by TM modes and their contribution is almost identical for both thicknesses. Z represents the distance from the centre of the gap. b, Corresponding transmission probability for TM modes, τp(ω, k), as a function of radiation energy and magnitude of the parallel wavevector for t = 100 nm and d = 20 nm. The white dashed line corresponds to the analytical dispersion relation of the cavity surface phonon polaritons, and the pink solid line next to the y-axis represents the light line, that is, ω = kc. The maxima of the transmission appear largely to the right of the light line and therefore correspond to evanescent waves. c, Normalized electric field intensity of a representative cavity surface phonon polariton (CSPhP) mode (ħω = 61.2 meV) for a gap of 20 nm and thicknesses of t = 3 µm (upper panel) and t = 100 nm (lower panel), normalized to peak intensity. Grey regions correspond to SiO2 and the yellow region represents Au. d, As in c, but for a gap of 100 nm.

        "text": "The application of conventional solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) to lithium-oxygen (Li\u2013O2) batteries has suffered from a limited active reaction zone due to thick SPE and subsequent lack of O2 gas diffusion route in the positive electrode. Here we present a new design for a three-dimensional (3-D) SPE structure, incorporating a carbon nanotube (CNT) electrode, adapted for a gas-based energy storage system. The void spaces in the porous CNT/SPE film allow an increased depth of diffusion of O2 gas, providing an enlarged active reaction zone where Li+ ions, O2 gas, and electrons can interact. Furthermore, the thin SPE layer along the CNT, forming the core/shell nanostructure, aids in the smooth electron transfer when O2 gas approaches the CNT surface. Therefore, the 3-D CNT/SPE electrode structure enhances the capacity in the SPE-based Li\u2013O2 cell. However, intrinsic instability of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) of the SPE matrix to superoxide (O2·−) and high voltage gives rise to severe side reactions, convincing us of the need for development of a more stable electrolyte for use in this CNT/SPE design.

        "text": "Superconductivity is a quantum phenomenon arising, in its simplest form, from the pairing of fermions with opposite spin into a state with zero net momentum. Whether superconductivity can occur in fermionic systems with an unequal number of two species distinguished by spin or flavour presents an important open question in condensed-matter physics or quantum chromodynamics1. In condensed matter the imbalance between spin-up and spin-down electrons that form the Cooper pairs is induced by the magnetic field. Such an imbalanced system can lead to exotic superconductivity in which pairs acquire finite momentum2, 3. This momentum leads to a spatially inhomogeneous state consisting of periodically alternating \u2018normal\u2019 and \u2018superconducting\u2019 regions. Here, we establish that the hallmark of this state is the appearance of spatially localized and spin-polarized quasiparticles forming the so-called Andreev bound states (ABS). These are detected through our nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. At a glance Figures Figure 1: (H,T) phase diagram of κ-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu(NCS)2. Curves and colour shaded areas sketch the phase diagram based on magnetic torque measurements12 for fields parallel to the conducting planes. Circles denote Tc, the transition temperature from the normal to the SC state, determined from our NMR data, as explained in the text, whereas squares mark the peak in the NMR rate. Diamonds denote the onset H above which (T1T)−1 exceeds the value extrapolated from the low-field SC state (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Information) below HP ≈ 20.7 T (ref. 15). Arrows indicate the field (H) and temperature (T) scans covered by NMR relaxation rate measurements. Figure 2: NMR relaxation rate in the normal and superconducting states. Temperature dependence of 13C NMR (T1T)−1 at fields of 15, 22 and 27 T, applied in the conducting planes (symbols). Solid line denotes the quadratic temperature dependence characteristic for superconductors with a gap having a line of nodes, such as for a d-wave symmetry. The dashed lines are guides to the eye. The parts of the phase diagram explored are shown by horizontal arrows in Fig. 1. Error bars reflect the scattering of measured (T1T)−1 values and the standard error of the mean in fitting the recovery curve. Inset: 13C NMR spectra at 22 T field applied parallel to the conducting planes in the superconducting (T = 1.4 K), FFLO (T = 2.6 K), and normal state (T = 10.9 K). Multiple peaks evident in the normal-state spectrum arise from the eight distinct crystallographic sites of 13C (Methods). Figure 3: Enhancement of the NMR relaxation rate in the FFLO state. Magnetic field dependence of 13C NMR (T1T)−1 at various temperatures. The parts of the phase diagram explored are shown by vertical arrows in Fig. 1. Error bars reflect the scattering of measured (T1T)−1 values and the standard error of the mean in fitting the recovery curve. Figure 4: Field dependence of the electronic spin polarization and NMR relaxation rate at low temperatures. Square root of the second moment, measuring electronic spin polarization, of the 13C NMR spectra (filled symbols, left scale) as a function of magnetic field applied in the conducting planes at different temperatures. Typical error bars are on the order of a few per cent and not shown for clarity. The corresponding field dependence of (T1T)−1 (open symbols, right scale) is shown for comparison. Vertical dashed lines identify a possible transition from the FFLO to the homogeneous SC state. Vertical solid lines denote a transition from the normal to the FFLO state. Other lines are guides to the eye.

In the vicinity of the transition from the SC to FFLO state the nodes in the order parameter form the domain walls14, as illustrated by the blue solid line. With increasing magnetic field the period of the order parameter decreases, as shown by red lines. Yellow circles denote nodal regions. Top panel: Sketch of the local DOS (ABS formed by quasiparticle resonances) at nodes of the order parameter normalized to its normal-state value. Sharp DOS peaks (blue) are expected in magnetic fields where nodes in the order parameter form the domain walls14. As the applied field increases, ABS are broadened and further shifted from zero energy, as depicted by red lines. The vertical arrows denote the spin orientation. The energy difference between spin-up and-down states is proportional to the applied magnetic field. d, Calculated temperature dependence (in arbitrary units (a.u.)) of the (T1T)−1 arising from the Andreev bound states formed at the nodes of the order parameter as sketched in part c. The result is only qualitatively correct, as states are phenomenologically modelled by Gaussians shifted away from the Fermi level by an amount proportional to the applied field14 and the temperature dependence of the gap is neglected.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information Circularly-polarized extreme ultraviolet and X-ray radiation is useful for analysing the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of materials. To date, such radiation has only been available at large-scale X-ray facilities such as synchrotrons. Here, we demonstrate the first bright, phase-matched, extreme ultraviolet circularly-polarized high harmonics source. The harmonics are emitted when bi-chromatic counter-rotating circularly-polarized laser pulses field-ionize a gas in a hollow-core waveguide. We use this new light source for magnetic circular dichroism measurements at the M-shell absorption edges of Co. We show that phase-matching of circularly-polarized harmonics is unique and robust, producing a photon flux comparable to linearly polarized high harmonic sources. This work represents a critical advance towards the development of table-top systems for element-specific imaging and spectroscopy of multiple elements simultaneously in magnetic and other chiral media with very high spatial and temporal resolution. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Pump symmetry and phase-matching condition for circularly-polarized HHG. a, The combined electric field of a left-circularly-polarized 790 nm driving laser beam (red) and a counter-rotating second-harmonic field (blue) is a threefold rosette shape (purple). The system has a discrete rotation dynamical symmetry of the light field, where a delay of acts as a rotation. This dynamical symmetry gives rise to circularly-polarized harmonics where harmonic orders q = 3m \u2013 1 rotate right and q = 3m + 1 rotate left. b, Calculated coherence length versus HHG order under phase-matching conditions that optimize the 28th harmonic. Phase-matching of circularly-polarized HHG is helicity-selective, so HHG orders q = 3m + 1 (left-circular polarization, LCP) have a longer coherence length (better phase-matching) than q = 3m \u2013 1 (right-circular polarization, RCP). Reabsorption of high harmonics in the gas medium reduces the contrast arising from this effect, as detailed in Supplementary Section 1. Figure 2: Experimental apparatus. Circularly-polarized harmonics are generated by focusing fundamental and second-harmonic pump beams (with opposing helicities) into a gas-filled hollow waveguide. The polarization states of the two drivers can be adjusted independently, thereby controlling the helicity of the generated harmonics. The magnetic state of a sample can then be measured with elemental specificity via XMCD by using harmonics that overlap with an appropriate core-level absorption edge, for example, the M-edge of Co. Right inset: helicity selectiveness for phase-matching of circularly-polarized HHG, where left-rotating harmonics (q = 3m + 1) and right-rotating harmonics (q = 3m \u2013 1) cannot be phase-matched simultaneously. In other words, if the q = 3m + 1 harmonics are phase-matched with the pump lasers, then the q = 3m \u2013 1 harmonics are mismatched by Δk. Left inset: typical experimental spectrum recorded on the CCD. Figure 3: Generation of bright circularly-polarized harmonics. a, HHG spectrum from Ar. b, HHG from N2 at 70 torr (black) and Ne at 650 torr (red).

Each notch mark on left axes indicates 10 kPa. Colour coding in c is a logarithm of the photoelectron counts per second on the CCD.

The experimental MO coefficient derived from the 3m + 1 harmonics accurately retrieves literature MO values (dashed line) without fitting any parameters. The reduced intensities and XMCD asymmetry of the 3m \u2013 1 harmonics suggests that these harmonics have lower ellipticity.

        "text": "Proton transfer through hydrogen bonds plays a fundamental role in many physical, chemical and biological processes1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Proton dynamics is susceptible to quantum tunnelling, which typically involves many hydrogen bonds simultaneously, leading to correlated many-body tunnelling6, 7, 8, 9. In contrast to the well-studied incoherent single-particle tunnelling, our understanding of many-body tunnelling is still in its infancy. Here we report the real-space observation of concerted proton tunnelling in a cyclic water tetramer using a cryogenic scanning tunnelling microscope. This is achieved by monitoring the reversible interconversion of the hydrogen-bonding chirality of the water tetramer with a chlorine-terminated scanning tunnelling microscope tip. We found that the presence of the Cl anion at the tip apex may either enhance or suppress the concerted tunnelling process, depending on the details of the coupling symmetry between the Cl ion and the protons. Our work opens up the possibility of controlling the quantum states of protons with atomic-scale precision. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Chirality switching of a H2O tetramer. a, Schematic showing manipulation of the chirality of the tetramer by a Cl-terminated tip. Left: the tetramer stays in the clockwise state (CS) when the tip is far away from the tetramer (gap set with V = 5 mV and I = 5 pA). Middle: reducing the tip height by 230 pm leads to chirality switching. Right: lifting the tip back to the initial height leaves the tetramer in the anticlockwise state (AS). b, Tunnelling current trace recorded during the chirality manipulation shown in a. Two current levels can be clearly distinguished in the range 300\u2013400 pA, where the low and high current levels correspond to CS and AS, respectively. Left and right insets: Adsorption configuration (upper) and STM images (lower) of CS and AS tetramers, respectively. Parameters for the STM images: V = 20 mV and I = 150 pA.

In a and b the statistical error is smaller than the data markers; the average of the switching rates for different bias and temperature is denoted by horizontal dashed lines, showing the negligible dependence on those factors. c, Dependence of the switching rate on tip height. Sample bias: 5 mV. The switching rates are sensitive to the tip height, exhibiting an initial rise (region I) followed by a rapid drop (region II) with decreasing tip height. The error bar represents the standard error. The tip height is referenced to the gap set with V = 5 mV and I = 5 pA.

Insets show snapshots along the transition path. b, Plots of the effective barrier height and full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) as a function of tip height. The tip height is defined as the distance between the Cl atom on the tip and the centroid of four oxygen atoms of the water tetramer. The horizontal black and red dashed lines denote the barrier height and width without the tip, respectively. c, Atomic model of the Cl\u2013tip/tetramer/NaCl-bilayer system.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information The fractional quantum Hall effect and superconductivity, remarkable phenomena in their own right, can harbour even more exotic physics at their interface. In particular, coupling quantum Hall edges with a superconductor can create emergent excitations known as non-Abelian anyons that trap widely coveted Majorana fermion zero-modes and generalizations thereof. We uncover non-local transport signatures of these zero-modes that not only provide striking experimental signatures of the anyons, but moreover allow one to construct novel circuit elements, including superconducting current and voltage mirrors, fractional charge transistors and flux-based capacitors. Underlying this unusual transport is a phenomenon that we term \u2018perfect Andreev conversion\u2019\u2014whereby quasiparticles propagating chirally at the edge reverse their electric charge as a result of hybridization with the zero-modes. Our findings suggest numerous experimental directions in the study of quantum-Hall\u2013superconductor systems hybrids and highlight a fundamentally new application of non-Abelian anyons. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Zero-modes in 1D \u2018wires\u2019. a, Majorana zero-modes γj bind to domain walls separating topological and trivial segments of a 1D superconducting wire. b, \u2018Parafermion\u2019 zero-modes αj, which represent generalized Majorana modes, localize between segments of a trench in a ν = 2/3 quantum Hall state gapped by tunnelling and Cooper pairing. In both cases the zero-modes encode a degeneracy among states with different charge Q (mod 2e) on the central region, as labelled in the figure. Figure 2: Andreev reflection and conversion. a, Electrons injected from a normal lead towards a 1D topological superconductor (SC) perfectly Andreev reflect into holes as a result of coupling with a Majorana zero-mode at the junction. b, The zero-mode in a pairing-gapped trench of a quantum Hall (QH) fluid similarly mediates \u2018perfect Andreev conversion\u2019, transforming incoming quasiparticles from the edge into outgoing quasiholes. Note that the voltage on the upper edge is reversed, doubling the transverse voltage drop relative to the applied voltage V. In either case, the superconductor absorbs the excess charge. Figure 3: Even/odd effect. a, Quantum Hall fluid with four pairing-gapped trenches generated by equipotential superconductors. If each superconductor induces perfect Andreev conversion, the same current I must flow through all four superconductors, with relative orientation indicated by the large arrows. b, If an odd number of equipotential superconductors enter the quantum Hall fluid, the system can no longer carry direct current, as the charge added to the superconductors due to Andreev conversion time-averages to zero. Figure 4: Mirror and swap. a,b, Current/voltage mirror (a) and current/voltage swap (b) circuit elements generated from perfect Andreev conversion. Figure 5: Flux capacitor. A voltage V applied to the normal electrode on the left generates current in the superconducting loop on the right. The induced flux is proportional to V\u2014hence the circuit acts as a \u2018flux capacitor\u2019. Unlike a standard inductor, current need not flow through the battery.

        "text": "The extraordinary strength, stiffness1 and lightness of graphene have generated great expectations of its application in flexible electronics and as a mechanical reinforcement agent. However, the presence of lattice defects, unavoidable in sheets obtained by scalable routes, might degrade its mechanical properties2, 3. Here we report a systematic study on the elastic modulus and strength of graphene with a controlled density of defects. Counter-intuitively, the in-plane Young\u2019s modulus increases with increasing defect density up to almost twice the initial value for a vacancy content of ~0.2%. For a higher density of vacancies, the elastic modulus decreases with defect inclusions. The initial increase in Young\u2019s modulus is explained in terms of a dependence of the elastic coefficients on the momentum of flexural modes predicted for two-dimensional membranes4, 5. In contrast, the fracture strength decreases with defect density according to standard fracture continuum models. These quantitative structure\u2013property relationships, measured in atmospheric conditions, are of fundamental and technological relevance and provide guidance for applications in which graphene mechanics represents a disruptive improvement. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Set-up and sample geometry. a, Device geometry and scheme of the nanoindentation set-up, which uses an AFM tip for mechanical testing of the suspended graphene layer. b, Irradiation set-up, where the defects induced by the incoming argon ions (red) were monitored in situ by measuring the ionic current density. The current, I, is measured with an ammeter. c, Optical microscopy image of a mono-(1), bi-(2) and multi-layer (N) graphene contacted by a gold electrode deposited on an array of wells. Scale bar, 15 μm. d, AFM image (top view) of a graphene sheet covering several circular wells. The graph corresponds to the topographic profile along the green line in the image. Figure 2: Characterization of pristine and defective graphene. a, STM image acquired in air at room temperature of a defect created on a graphite sample irradiated under the same conditions as described in the main text. The image is in excellent agreement with those reported previously for single atomic vacancies17. The electronic perturbation near the defects, observed as a threefold periodicity surrounding the defect, identifies it unambiguously as a point defect. b, Raman spectra of the same membrane before (blue) and after (red) irradiation. The post-irradiation curve is shifted vertically for clarity. The defect density was estimated from the intensity relation between the D and G peaks. c, F(δ) obtained in the same drumhead before (blue) and after (red) irradiation. d, Histogram of E2D obtained from several indentations in the same drumhead before (blue) and after (red) irradiation. To facilitate a comparison with three-dimensional materials, on the upper axis we divide the results by the interatomic layer spacing in graphite (0.34 nm). In b\u2013d irradiation yields 4 × 1012 defects cm−2. Figure 3: Mechanical characterization as a function of defect density. a, E2D as a function of defect concentration. Dark and light green circles correspond to two representative drumheads (drum 1 and drum 2) that were tracked after multiple irradiations. Grey squares represent measurements of up to 20 different drumheads contained in five different membranes. Blue and red circled stars correspond to the values of E2D obtained from the measurements depicted in Fig. 2. Error bars are not shown for the sake of clarity. Measurements with errors bars can be found in Supplementary Information 4.

We have recently reported that it directs lysosomal targeting of nascent neurotoxic \u200bamyloid-β (\u200bAβ) peptides by directly binding \u200bAβ. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the human \u200bsorLA domain responsible for \u200bAβ capture, Vps10p, in an unbound state and in complex with two ligands. Vps10p assumes a ten-bladed β-propeller fold with a large tunnel at the center. An internal ligand derived from the \u200bsorLA propeptide bound inside the tunnel to extend the β-sheet of one of the propeller blades. The structure of the \u200bsorLA Vps10p\u2013\u200bAβ complex revealed that the same site is used. Peptides are recognized by \u200bsorLA Vps10p in redundant modes without strict dependence on a particular amino acid sequence, thus suggesting a broad specificity toward peptides with a propensity for β-sheet formation.

        "text": "Dipolar Bosonic atoms confined in external potentials open up new avenues for quantum-state manipulation and will contribute to the design and exploration of novel functional materials. Here we investigate the ground-state and rotational properties of a rotating two-component dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate, which consists of both dipolar bosonic atoms with magnetic dipole moments aligned vertically to the condensate and one without dipole moments, confined in concentrically coupled annular traps. For the nonrotational case, it is found that the tunable dipolar interaction can be used to control the location of each component between the inner and outer rings, and to induce the desired ground-state phase. Under finite rotation, it is shown that there exists a critical value of rotational frequency for the nondipolar case, above which vortex state can form at the trap center, and the related vortex structures depend strongly on the rotational frequency. For the dipolar case, it is found that various ground-state phases and the related vortex structures, such as polygonal vortex clusters and vortex necklaces, can be obtained via a proper choice of the dipolar interaction and rotational frequency.

        "text": "Deformation normal to the surface is intrinsic in two-dimensional materials due to phononic thermal fluctuations at finite temperatures. Graphene's negative thermal expansion coefficient is generally explained by such an intrinsic property. Recently, friction measurements on graphene exfoliated on a silicon oxide surface revealed an anomalous anisotropy whose origin was believed to be the formation of ripple domains. Here, we uncover the atomistic origin of the observed friction domains using a cantilever torsion microscopy in conjunction with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We experimentally demonstrate that ripples on graphene are formed along the zigzag direction of the hexagonal lattice. The formation of zigzag directional ripple is consistent with our theoretical model that takes account of the atomic-scale bending stiffness of carbon-carbon bonds and the interaction of graphene with the substrate. The correlation between micrometer-scale ripple alignment and atomic-scale arrangement of exfoliated monolayer graphene is first discovered and suggests a practical tool for measuring lattice orientation of graphene.

Based on such a bound state, we have realized strong optical absorption in the monolayer graphene. Such a strong optical absorption exhibits many advantages. It is ultrasensitive to the wavelength because the Q factor of the absorption peak can be more than 2000. By taking suitable BICs, the selective absorption for S and P waves has not only been realized, but also all-angle absorption for the S and P waves at the same time has been demonstrated.

        "text": "Water confined within nanoscale geometries under external field has many interesting properties which is very important for its application in biological processes and engineering. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the effect of external fields on polarization and structure as well as phase transformations of water confined within carbon nanotubes. We find that dipoles of water molecules tend to align along external field in nanoscale cylindrical confinement. Such alignment directly leads to the longitudinal electrostriction and cross-sectional dilation of water in nanotube. It also influences the stability of ice structures. As the electrostatic field strengthens, the confined water undergoes phase transitions from a prism structure to a helical one to a single chain as the electrostatic field strengthens.

        "text": "Anthropogenic elemental mercury (Hg0) emission is a serious worldwide environmental problem due to the extreme toxicity of the heavy metal to humans, plants and wildlife. Development of an accurate and cheap microsensor based online monitoring system which can be integrated as part of Hg0 removal and control processes in industry is still a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate that forming Au nanospike structures directly onto the electrodes of a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) using a novel electrochemical route results in a self-regenerating, highly robust, stable, sensitive and selective Hg0 vapor sensor. The data from a 127 day continuous test performed in the presence of volatile organic compounds and high humidity levels, showed that the sensor with an electrodeposted sensitive layer had 260% higher response magnitude, 3.4 times lower detection limit (~22 μg/m3 or ~2.46 ppbv) and higher accuracy (98% Vs 35%) over a Au control based QCM (unmodified) when exposed to a Hg0 vapor concentration of 10.55 mg/m3 at 101°C. Statistical analysis of the long term data showed that the nano-engineered Hg0 sorption sites on the developed Au nanospikes sensitive layer play a critical role in the enhanced sensitivity and selectivity of the developed sensor towards Hg0 vapor.

        "text": "We present a MoS2 biosensor to electrically detect prostate specific antigen (PSA) in a highly sensitive and label-free manner. Unlike previous MoS2-FET-based biosensors, the device configuration of our biosensors does not require a dielectric layer such as HfO2 due to the hydrophobicity of MoS2. Such an oxide-free operation improves sensitivity and simplifies sensor design. For a quantitative and selective detection of PSA antigen, anti-PSA antibody was immobilized on the sensor surface. Then, introduction of PSA antigen, into the anti-PSA immobilized sensor surface resulted in a lable-free immunoassary format. Measured off-state current of the device showed a significant decrease as the applied PSA concentration was increased. The minimum detectable concentration of PSA is 1 pg/mL, which is several orders of magnitude below the clinical cut-off level of ~4 ng/mL. In addition, we also provide a systematic theoretical analysis of the sensor platform \u2013 including the charge state of protein at the specific pH level, and self-consistent channel transport. Taken together, the experimental demonstration and the theoretical framework provide a comprehensive description of the performance potential of dielectric-free MoS2-based biosensor technology.

The MoS2 nanosheet biosensor consists of a gate insulator of SiO2 (300 nm) and a drain-source metal contact of Ti/Au (15 nm/300 nm) (b) The water contact angle measurement to confirm hydrophobic characteristics of different substrates: the water contact angle of MoS2, Au, and SiO2 substrate are 75.75°, 75.72°, and 23.1°, respectively. The contact angle of MoS2 surface, which is more hydrophobic than Si-based substrates, is comparable to that of Au surface. This suggests that MoS2 nanosheet is an excellent candidate for functionalizing antibody and protein due to its hydrophobic surface.

(a) Transfer characteristics of MoS2 transistor biosensor functionalized by anti-PSA of 100 μg/mL under various PSA concentrations. The surface of MoS2 nanosheet is initially functionalized with anti-PSA antibody receptor.

(b) Change of the off-current versus various PSA concentrations for an anti-PSA modified n-type MoS2 transistor at the condition of Vgs = −40 V and Vds = 1 V.

        "text": "Magnetotactic bacteria biomineralize ordered chains of uniform, membrane-bound magnetite or greigite nanocrystals that exhibit nearly perfect crystal structures and species-specific morphologies. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a critical technique for providing information regarding the organization of cellular and magnetite structures in these microorganisms. However, conventional TEM can only be used to image air-dried or vitrified bacteria removed from their natural environment. Here we present a correlative scanning TEM (STEM) and fluorescence microscopy technique for imaging viable cells of Magnetospirillum magneticum strain AMB-1 in liquid using an in situ fluid cell TEM holder. Fluorescently labeled cells were immobilized on microchip window surfaces and visualized in a fluid cell with STEM, followed by correlative fluorescence imaging to verify their membrane integrity. Notably, the post-STEM fluorescence imaging indicated that the bacterial cell wall membrane did not sustain radiation damage during STEM imaging at low electron dose conditions. We investigated the effects of radiation damage and sample preparation on the bacteria viability and found that approximately 50% of the bacterial membranes remained intact after an hour in the fluid cell, decreasing to ~30% after two hours. These results represent a first step toward in vivo studies of magnetite biomineralization in magnetotactic bacteria.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information The ability to tune material properties using gating by electric fields is at the heart of modern electronic technology. It is also a driving force behind recent advances in two-dimensional systems, such as the observation of gate electric-field-induced superconductivity and metal\u2013insulator transitions. Here, we describe an ionic field-effect transistor (termed an iFET), in which gate-controlled Li ion intercalation modulates the material properties of layered crystals of 1T-TaS2. The strong charge doping induced by the tunable ion intercalation alters the energetics of various charge-ordered states in 1T-TaS2 and produces a series of phase transitions in thin-flake samples with reduced dimensionality. We find that the charge-density wave states in 1T-TaS2 collapse in the two-dimensional limit at critical thicknesses. Meanwhile, at low temperatures, the ionic gating induces multiple phase transitions from Mott-insulator to metal in 1T-TaS2 thin flakes, with five orders of magnitude modulation in resistance, and superconductivity emerges in a textured charge-density wave state induced by ionic gating. Our method of gate-controlled intercalation opens up possibilities in searching for novel states of matter in the extreme charge-carrier-concentration limit.

Curves are shifted horizontally for clarity, and the origin of each curve is marked by colour-matched triangles. b, Ratio r between lowest resistance Rmin during the gate sweep and initial resistance R0 in the samples as a function of sample thickness. Red line: Fit according to the model described in the text. Inset: Inhomogeneous doping in the out-of-plane direction assumed in the model, where tc is the modulation depth of the gate-controlled intercalation (tc = 14 nm is obtained from the fitting, as indicated by the arrow in the main figure). Horizontal error bars represent the uncertainty in sample thickness determination from AFM and optical measurements. The two vertical error bars are derived from the contact resistance of the two devices measured in a two-terminal geometry. c, Resistance of a sample during ten gate sweep cycles (only up-sweeps are shown). No appreciable change is observed after repeated gate sweeps. Figure 4: Electronic transport in 1T-TaS2 thin flakes under gate-controlled intercalation. a\u2013c, Temperature-dependent resistance at fixed gate voltages for three sample thicknesses: 14 nm, 8 nm and 3.5 nm. The inset in each panel displays the gate-induced NCCDW/ICCDW phase transition at 310 K, which serves as a colour-coded reference of Vg. Arrows in each plot indicate the direction of increasing Vg. Black dashed lines mark the value of R­Q defined in the main text. d, Resistance and volumetric carrier density (n3D) measured as a function of Vg at 10 K in the same 14-nm-thick sample shown in a. n3D is obtained from the line fit to the Hall resistance, which is much larger than the estimated charge density expected from EDL surface doping39 (red dashed line; the surface charge density has been converted to volumetric carrier density for easy comparison). Error bars represent the uncertainty of the line fit. Blue dashed line: Doping level corresponding to 1 electron per David-star. e, Zero-resistance superconducting state of a typical gated 1T-TaS2 flake subjected to a varying perpendicular magnetic field.

The diagrams are obtained from the data in Fig. 4a\u2013c. Boundaries of the CCDW, NCCDW and superconducting (SC) phases are marked by blue, red and black symbols, respectively. Only transition temperatures recorded during cooldown are shown for simplicity. The metal\u2013insulator transition temperature in c is defined as the temperature where the (initially metallic) sample starts to show insulating behaviour as the temperature is lowered. Horizontal and vertical error bars denote the widths of the phase transitions in Vg and temperature, respectively.

        "text": "The piezoelectric characteristics of nanowires, thin films and bulk crystals have been closely studied for potential applications in sensors, transducers, energy conversion and electronics1, 2, 3. With their high crystallinity and ability to withstand enormous strain4, 5, 6, two-dimensional materials are of great interest as high-performance piezoelectric materials. Monolayer MoS2 is predicted to be strongly piezoelectric, an effect that disappears in the bulk owing to the opposite orientations of adjacent atomic layers7, 8. Here we report the first experimental study of the piezoelectric properties of two-dimensional MoS2 and show that cyclic stretching and releasing of thin MoS2 flakes with an odd number of atomic layers produces oscillating piezoelectric voltage and current outputs, whereas no output is observed for flakes with an even number of layers. A single monolayer flake strained by 0.53% generates a peak output of 15 mV and 20 pA, corresponding to a power density of 2 mW m−2 and a 5.08% mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency. In agreement with theoretical predictions, the output increases with decreasing thickness and reverses sign when the strain direction is rotated by 90°. Transport measurements show a strong piezotronic effect in single-layer MoS2, but not in bilayer and bulk MoS2. The coupling between piezoelectricity and semiconducting properties in two-dimensional nanomaterials may enable the development of applications in powering nanodevices, adaptive bioprobes and tunable/stretchable electronics/optoelectronics.

        "text": "Predicting the equilibrium ordered structures at internal interfaces, especially in the case of nanometer-scale chemical heterogeneities, is an ongoing challenge in materials science. In this study, we established an ab-initio coarse-grained modeling technique for describing the phase-like behavior of a close-packed stacking-fault-type interface containing solute nanoclusters, which undergo a two-dimensional disorder-order transition, depending on the temperature and composition. Notably, this approach can predict the two-dimensional medium-range ordering in the nanocluster arrays realized in Mg-based alloys, in a manner consistent with scanning tunneling microscopy-based measurements. We predicted that the repulsively interacting solute-cluster system undergoes a continuous evolution into a highly ordered densely packed morphology while maintaining a high degree of six-fold orientational order, which is attributable mainly to an entropic effect. The uncovered interaction-dependent ordering properties may be useful for the design of nanostructured materials utilizing the self-organization of two-dimensional nanocluster arrays in the close-packed interfaces.

A spherical nanoparticle array was transferred using a soft nanolithography technique, which is a simple and effective pattern transfer method for nanostructures on the surface of thin adhesive polymers on a planar substrate, after placing the spherical nanoparticles on a patterned PDMS [poly(dimethysiloxane)] stamp produced from a patterned Si wafer. The resulting non-spherical nanoparticle array was driven from a spherical nanoparticle array shape-modified by ion beam irradiation. A well-arrayed layer of cone-like-shapes were produced using a head-on ion beam for different exposure times. Also, a variety of mushroom-like-shapes depending on the exposure angle were produced on a substrate with a well-arranged spherical nanoparticle array.

Here, we demonstrate a synthetic strategy that exploits two bioorthogonal photochemistries to achieve reversible immobilization of bioactive full-length proteins with good spatial and temporal control within synthetic, cell-laden biomimetic scaffolds. A photodeprotection\u2013oxime-ligation sequence permits user-defined quantities of proteins to be anchored within distinct subvolumes of a three-dimensional matrix, and an ortho-nitrobenzyl ester photoscission reaction facilitates subsequent protein removal. By using this approach to pattern the presentation of the extracellular matrix protein \u200bvitronectin, we accomplished reversible differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts in a spatially defined manner. Our protein-patterning approach should provide further avenues to probe and direct changes in cell physiology in response to dynamic biochemical signalling. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Hydrogel components and reactions used for photoreversible protein patterning. a, \u200bAzide- and alkyne-functionalized precursors react by means of step-growth polymerization to form enzymatically degradable, poly(ethylene glycol)-based 3D hydrogels decorated uniformly with NPPOC-photocaged alkoxyamines. b, Gelation occurs through strain-promoted azide\u2013alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC). c, Treatment of proteins with NHS-oNB-CHO imparts photopatternability through introduction of reactive aldehydes linked through photoscissile o-nitrobenzyl ester (oNB) moieties. d, NPPOC-caged alkoxyamines distributed uniformly throughout hydrogels (R1) undergo irreversible β-elimination on exposure to ultraviolet light (λ = 365 or 740 nm). The liberated alkoxyamines react with aldehyde-functionalized proteins (R2) to form oxime linkages. e, o-nitrobenzyl ester (oNB) moieties linking the protein of interest (R1) and the hydrogel (R2) undergo photocleavage on exposure to ultraviolet light (λ = 365 nm or 740 nm). f, Schematic of the photoreversible patterning strategy, in which NHS-oNB-CHO-functionalized proteins are first tethered to the gel through photomediated oxime ligation and subsequently removed on further light exposure. Figure 2: Patterning of proteins into SPAAC-based gels by means of photomediated oxime ligation. Photoliberated alkoxyamines react with aldehyde-functionalized proteins to form oxime linkages patterned throughout the gel. a, By controlling the degree of NPPOC uncaging (C0 = 100 μM) through variation in light intensity (5, 10, 20 mW cm−2, λ = 365 nm) and exposure time (0\u2013300 s), protein immobilization was varied within wide limits. Data points in a correspond to mean values of three independent experimental replicates. Error bars correspond to the standard deviation about the mean. b,c, Exponential protein gradients were generated predictably by exposing gel surfaces to linear gradients of light exposure, created by covering samples with an opaque photomask moving at different rates (0.6, 1.2, 2.4 mm min−1). d, Photolithography (λ = 365 nm) was used to immobilize proteins in discrete patterns throughout the gel thickness. e, Multiphoton laser-scanning lithography (λ = 740 nm) enabled 3D control over protein immobilization.

Immobilized proteins of interest are released from the hydrogel on o-nitrobenzyl ester (oNB) photocleavage. a, By regulating the degree of oNB photocleavage through variation in light intensity (5, 10, 20 mW cm−2, λ = 365 nm) and exposure time (0\u2013600 s), photorelease was controlled within wide limits. Data points in a correspond to mean values of three independent experimental replicates. Error bars correspond to the standard deviation about the mean. b,c, By subjecting uniformly functionalized hydrogels to linear gradients of light exposure (created by covering samples with an opaque photomask moving at rates of 0.3, 0.6, or 1.2 mm min−1), exponential protein gradients were generated in a predictable manner. d,e, Subsets of immobilized proteins were removed by patterned exposure to UV light (λ = 365 nm or 740 nm).

Scale bars, 500 μm (c), 100 μm (d) and 150 μm (e). Figure 4: Interconnected dual-protein patterns generated through protein photorelease and oxime ligation. a, Because the chemistries used for protein tethering and excision (that is, NPPOC uncaging and oNB photolysis) can be initiated with the same light sources, interconnected biochemical patterns can be generated by carrying out these processes simultaneously. If protein attachment by means of photomediated oxime ligation is performed without complete alkoxyamine deprotection, the surviving NPPOC moieties will be uncaged concurrently with release of the first protein on a second round of light exposure. This procedure results in the creation of anchoring sites for further protein immobilization in the regions of photorelease. If the first protein is fully removed from the volumes exposed in the second round, patterned proteins are immobilized within mutually exclusive subvolumes of the gel. b,c, Masked light (λ = 365 nm) was used to generate interspaced line patterns of two fluorescently labelled proteins at equal concentrations extending throughout the gel with minimal overlap. d,e, Dual-protein patterning was performed using pulsed laser light (λ = 740 nm) to create interlocked chains of a red protein in a sea of green. All studies were performed with pre-patterned protein BSA488-oNB-CHO (green, 50 μM) and secondary protein BSA594-oNB-CHO (red). Gels were imaged by fluorescence confocal microscopy. Scale bars, 200 μm (b) and 50 μm (d,e). Figure 5: Proteins remain bioactive on photoreversible patterning of gels. a, The self-quenched FAM-RGL↓GPAGRK(FAM)-NH2 peptide probe, whose fluorescence increases significantly on enzymatic cleavage, serves as a fluorogenic reporter of collagenase activity. b, Such enzymatic activity remains high for both gel-immobilized and photoreleased collagenase. Data is plotted as mean; error bars are standard error of mean; *** denotes p < 0.001. c,d, Patterned primary antibodies are visualized with a fluorescent secondary antibody, indicating that the gel-bound primary antibody remained functionally recognizable to the secondary antibody. e, Tethered Delta interacts with surface Notch receptor to trigger two proteolytic cleavages that release Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane. NICD undergoes nuclear translocation and converts the CSL transcriptional repressor to an activator. This activation promotes Notch-mediated signalling and, in the case of the used U2OS Notch reporter cell line, luciferase expression. f, U2OS reporter cells cultured on Delta-functionalized gels exhibit enhanced Notch signalling compared with unfunctionalized gels, with or without the addition of soluble Delta. Data is plotted as mean; error bars are standard error of mean; * denotes p < 0.05. Scale bar, 3 mm (d). Figure 6: Spatial and temporal control of hMSC differentiation by photoreversible patterning of \u200bvitronectin. a, hMSCs were labelled with CellTracker Red and encapsulated (3 × 106 cells ml−1) in enzymatically degradable SPAAC-based networks. On day 1, \u200bvitronectin (\u200bVTN, 100 μM) was patterned into hydrogels by means of photomediated oxime ligation to induce cell spreading. Culture was continued for three more days, after which \u200bVTN was photoreleased. Cells were maintained in culture until day 10. hMSC differentiation was assessed by immunocytochemical staining for \u200bosteocalcin (\u200bOC, green) and by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assays, on days 1, 4 and 10. b\u2013e, For uniformly functionalized gels, cells exhibited limited interaction with the hydrogel matrix before the introduction of \u200bVTN on day 1, after which cells stained positive for \u200bOC and exhibited increased ALP activity. After \u200bVTN photorelease on day 4, cells returned to a spherical unbound state and exhibited marked decreases in \u200bOC staining and ALP activity. f\u2013i, For hydrogels containing spatially patterned \u200bVTN, \u200bOC-positive staining was confined to \u200bVTN-functionalized portions of the material (indicated by dashed rectangles). On patterned removal of the adhesive protein, staining for \u200bOC was observed only in \u200bVTN islands. Images in b\u2013d and f\u2013h represent single z-slices from fluorescence confocal microscopy. ALP activity assays in e are normalized to the value on day 1.

        "text": "Recently, strong spin-orbit coupling with equal Rashba and Dresselhaus strength has been realized in neutral atomic Bose-Einstein condensates via a pair of Raman lasers. In this report, we investigate spin and field squeezing of the ground state in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. By mapping the spin-orbit coupled BEC to the well-known quantum Dicke model, the Dicke type quantum phase transition is presented with the order parameters quantified by the spin polarization and occupation number of harmonic trap mode. This Dicke type quantum phase transition may be captured by the spin and field squeezing arising from the spin-orbit coupling. We further consider the effect of a finite detuning on the ground state and show the spin polarization and the quasi-momentum exhibit a step jump at zero detuning. Meanwhile, we also find that the presence of the detuning enhances the occupation number of harmonic trap mode, while it suppresses the spin and the field squeezing.

        "text": "We propose a mechanism of ultrahigh-Q metallic nanocavity resonances that involves an efficient loss-compensation scheme favorable for room-temperature operation. We theoretically show that surface plasmon-polaritons excited on the entrance and exit interfaces of a metallic nanocavity array efficiently transfer external optical gain to the cavity modes by inducing resonantly-amplified intracavity feedback. Surprisingly, the modal gain in the nanocavity with the externally amplified feedback is inversely proportional to the cavity length as opposed to conventional optical cavity amplifiers requiring longer cavities for higher optical gain. Utilizing this effect, we numerically demonstrate room-temperature nanocavity resonance Q-factor exceeding 104 in a 25-nm-wide silver nanoslit array. The proposed mechanism provides a highly efficient plasmonic amplification process particularly for subwavelength plasmonic cavities which are essential components in active nanoplasmonic devices.

        "text": "Electrochemical conversion reactions of transition metal compounds create opportunities for large energy storage capabilities exceeding modern Li-ion batteries. However, for practical electrodes to be envisaged, a detailed understanding of their mechanisms is needed, especially vis-à-vis the voltage hysteresis observed between reduction and oxidation. Here, we present such insight at scales from local atomic arrangements to whole electrodes. NiO was chosen as a simple model system. The most important finding is that the voltage hysteresis has its origin in the differing chemical pathways during reduction and oxidation. This asymmetry is enabled by the presence of small metallic clusters and, thus, is likely to apply to other transition metal oxide systems. The presence of nanoparticles also influences the electrochemical activity of the electrolyte and its degradation products and can create differences in transport properties within an electrode, resulting in localized reactions around converted domains that lead to compositional inhomogeneities at the microscale.

        "text": "Allostery is an essential regulatory mechanism of biological function. Allosteric sites are also pharmacologically relevant as they are often targeted with higher selectivity than orthosteric sites. However, a comprehensive map of allosteric sites poses experimental challenges because allostery is driven not only by structural changes, but also by modulations in dynamics that typically remain elusive to classical structure determination methods. An avenue to overcome these challenges is provided by the NMR chemical shift covariance analysis (CHESCA), as chemical shifts are exquisitely sensitive to redistributions in dynamic conformational ensembles. Here, we propose a set of complementary CHESCA algorithms designed to reliably detect allosteric networks with minimal occurrences of false positives or negatives. The proposed CHESCA toolset was tested for two allosteric proteins (PKA and EPAC) and is expected to complement traditional comparative structural analyses in the comprehensive identification of functionally relevant allosteric sites, including those in otherwise elusive partially unstructured regions.

Initially, the chart starts with CHESCA-CL, since it provides an optimal balance between the minimization of false positives and false negatives. If residual false positives are detected through CHESPA, the application of the CHESCA-I approach is recommended to minimize those arising from the CCS compression. If false negatives are revealed through CHESPA, the implementation of the CHESCA-SL algorithm is also advised. It is sufficient to implement each type of CHESCA analysis only once. However, multiple types of CHESCA analyses (i.e. SL, CL, I) are often needed for a single chemical shift data set. Full size image View in article",

Herein, hexagonal-like Nb2O5 nanoplates are synthesized using a facile solvothermal method. UV photodetectors based on single Nb2O5 nanoplates are constructed and the optoelectronic properties have been probed. The photodetectors show remarkable sensitivity with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 9617%, and adequate wavelength selectivity with respect to UV-A light. In addition, the photodetectors exhibit robust stability and strong dependence of photocurrent on light intensity. Also, a low-cost drop-casting method is used to fabricate photodetectors based on Nb2O5 nanoplate film, which exhibit singular thermal stability. Moreover, the hexagonal-like Nb2O5 nanoplates show significantly better photocatalytic performances in decomposing Methylene-blue and Rhdamine B dyes than commercial Nb2O5.

        "text": "Cyclodextrins (CDs) can hardly self-assemble into well-defined structures. Here we report if they preassemble into channel type dimers assisted by dodecane, well-defined vesicles and bricks can be formed. Unlike the traditional self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules driven by hydrophobic effect, the self-assembly of the channel type dodecane@2β-CD supramolecular building block is predoninantly driven by hydrogen-bonds. More water molecules are found in the lyophilized vesicles than in the bricks, suggesting water molecules play an important role in the self-assembly of the channel-type dimers of β-CD. The amount of structural water in the self-assembly is closely related to the curvature of the final self-assembled structures.

        "text": "Glasses are rigid systems in which competing interactions prevent simultaneous minimization of local energies. This leads to frustration and highly degenerate ground states the nature and properties of which are still far from being thoroughly understood. We report an analytical approach based on the method of functional equations that allows us to construct the Rayleigh approximation to the ground state of a two-dimensional (2D) random Coulomb system with logarithmic interactions. We realize a model for 2D Coulomb glass as a cylindrical type II superconductor containing randomly located columnar defects (CD) which trap superconducting vortices induced by applied magnetic field. Our findings break ground for analytical studies of glassy systems, marking an important step towards understanding their properties.

        "text": "Traditionally, strain effect was mainly considered in the materials with periodic lattice structure, and was thought to be very weak in amorphous semiconductors. Here, we investigate the effects of strain in films of cobalt-doped amorphous carbon (Co-C) grown on 0.7PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3-0.3PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) substrates. The electric transport properties of the Co-C films were effectively modulated by the piezoelectric substrates. Moreover, we observed, for the first time, strain-induced photoconductivity in such an amorphous semiconductor. Without strain, no photoconductivity was observed. When subjected to strain, the Co-C films exhibited significant photoconductivity under illumination by a 532-nm monochromatic light. A strain-modified photoconductivity theory was developed to elucidate the possible mechanism of this remarkable phenomenon. The good agreement between the theoretical and experimental results indicates that strain-induced photoconductivity may derive from modulation of the band structure via the strain effect.

Nitrogen substitutions make the system display half-metallic properties, and the origin of room temperature ferromagnetism ascribes to the p-p coupling interaction between N 2p and the host 2p states. The charge density difference and Mülliken population analyses provide evidences of charge redistributions.

        "text": "Laser filamentation in gases is often carried out in the laboratory with focusing optics to better stabilize the filament, whereas real-world applications of filaments frequently involve collimated or near-collimated beams. It is well documented that geometrical focusing can alter the properties of laser filaments and, consequently, a transition between a collimated and a strongly focused filament is expected. Nevertheless, this transition point has not been identified. Here, we propose an analytical method to determine the transition, and show that it corresponds to an actual shift in the balance of physical mechanisms governing filamentation. In high-NA conditions, filamentation is primarily governed by geometrical focusing and plasma effects, while the Kerr nonlinearity plays a more significant role as NA decreases.

The Fe2O3 nanomembrane electrodes exhibit ultra-long cycling life at high current rates with satisfactory capacity (808 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 2 C and 530 mAh g−1 after 3000 cycles at 6 C) as well as repeatable high rate capability up to 50 C. The excellent performance benefits particularly from the unique structural advantages of the nanomembranes. The mechanical feature can buffer the strain of lithiation/delithiation to postpone the pulverization. The two-dimensional transport pathways in between the nanomembranes can promote the pseudo-capacitive type storage. The parallel-laid nanomembranes, which are coated by polymeric gel-like film and SEI layer with the electrolyte in between layers, electrochemically behave like numerous \u201cmini-capacitors\u201d to provide the pseudo-capacitance thus maintain the capacity at high rate.

        "text": "Practical applications of the high temperature thermoelectric materials developed so far are partially obstructed by the costly and complicated fabrication process. In this work, we put forward two additional important properties for thermoelectric materials, high crystal symmetry and congruent melting. We propose that the recently discovered thermoelectric material Cu2-xSe, with figure of merit, zT, over 1.5 at T of ~ 1000 K, should meet these requirements, based on our analysis of its crystal structure and the Cu-Se binary phase diagram. We found that its excellent thermoelectric performance is intrinsic, and less dependent on grain size, while highly dense samples can be easily fabricated by a melt-quenching approach. Our results reveal that the melt-quenched samples and single crystals exhibit almost the same superior thermoelectric performance, with zT as high as 1.7\u20131.8 at T of ~973 K. Our findings not only provide a cheap and fast fabrication method for highly dense Cu2-xSe bulks with superior thermoelectric performance, paving the way for possible commercialization of Cu2-xSe as an outstanding component in practical thermoelectric modules, but also provide guidance in searching for new classes of thermoelectric systems with high crystal symmetry or further improving the cost performance of other existing congruent-melting thermoelectric materials.

Here we compare the local texture of state-of-the-art Bi2212 and Bi2223 ((Bi,Pb)2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10), finding that round wire Bi2212 generates a dominant a-axis growth texture that also enforces a local biaxial texture (FWHM c-axes of its polycrystals to rotate azimuthally along and about the filament axis so as to generate macroscopically isotropic behavior. By contrast Bi2223 shows only a uniaxial (FWHM c-axis texture perpendicular to the tape plane without any in-plane texture. Consistent with these observations, a marked, field-increasing, field-decreasing Jc(H) hysteresis characteristic of weak-linked systems appears in Bi2223 but is absent in Bi2212 round wire. Growth-induced texture on cooling from the melt step of the Bi2212 Jc optimization process appears to be the key step in generating this highly desirable microstructure.

The triangles of Bi2212 and Bi2223 indicate Jc measured in increasing field, whereas the circles of Bi2212 and Bi2223 represent Jc in decreasing field. Note that Jc of Bi2212 round wire is approximately 3 times larger than that of the Bi2223 flat tape and is without any field hysteresis, which is quite evident in Bi2223 and is shown more clearly in the inset.

        "text": "Nuclear energy provides more than 10% of electrical power internationally, and the increasing engagement of nuclear energy is essential to meet the rapid worldwide increase in energy demand. A paramount challenge in the development of advanced nuclear reactors is the discovery of advanced structural materials that can endure extreme environments, such as severe neutron irradiation damage at high temperatures. It has been known for decades that high dose radiation can introduce significant void swelling accompanied by precipitation in austenitic stainless steel (SS). Here we report, however, that through nanoengineering, ultra-fine grained (UFG) 304L SS with an average grain size of ~100 nm, can withstand Fe ion irradiation at 500°C to 80 displacements-per-atom (dpa) with moderate grain coarsening. Compared to coarse grained (CG) counterparts, swelling resistance of UFG SS is improved by nearly an order of magnitude and swelling rate is reduced by a factor of 5. M23C6 precipitates, abundant in irradiated CG SS, are largely absent in UFG SS. This study provides a nanoengineering approach to design and discover radiation tolerant metallic materials for applications in extreme radiation environments.

Full size image View in article Figure 3: Statistic studies show that UFG 304L SS has significantly lower void swelling than CG 304L SS due to reduced void density and size. (a) Statistic analysis shows that void density along the projected radiation depth reached a maximum both near surface and at 700\u2013800 nm in irradiated CG specimen. In UFG specimens, the maximum void density occurred near surface region, and the overall void density in UFG SS was much less than that of CG counterpart throughout the entire irradiated specimens.

We observed a large lengthwise shrinkage of ~35% for phosphate glasses with an enhanced one-dimensional structure, as well as a distinct endotherm on reheating them up to temperatures between that of the glass transition temperature and the softening temperature.

        "text": "The thermodynamic properties of gases have been understood primarily through phase diagrams of bulk gases. However, observations of gases confined in a nanometer space have posed a challenge to the principles of classical thermodynamics. Here, we investigated interfacial structures comprising either O2 or N2 between water and a hydrophobic solid surface by using advanced atomic force microscopy techniques. Ordered epitaxial layers and cap-shaped nanostructures were observed. In addition, pancake-shaped disordered layers that had grown on top of the epitaxial base layers were observed in oxygen-supersaturated water. We propose that hydrophobic solid surfaces provide low-chemical-potential sites at which gas molecules dissolved in water can be adsorbed. The structures are further stabilized by interfacial water. Here we show that gas molecules can agglomerate into a condensed form when confined in a sufficiently small space under ambient conditions. The crystalline solid surface may even induce a solid-gas state when the gas-substrate interaction is significantly stronger than the gas-gas interaction. The ordering and thermodynamic properties of the confined gases are determined primarily according to interfacial interactions. Subject terms: Molecular self-assembly\u2022 Surfaces, interfaces and thin films\u2022 Imaging techniques At a glance Figures View all figures Figure 1: FM-AFM measurements of a HOPG-water interface after oxygen-supersaturated water was deposited. (a) Topographic image acquired at t = 300 min. A cap-shaped nanostructure marked with \u201c+\u201d serves as a marker for comparison with other images. (b) Higher-resolution height image of a region around the cap-shaped nanostructure marked with \u201c+\u201d acquired at t = 310 min. Because of the large height variation of various structures, the contrast of the row-like patterns in the base layers cannot be clearly shown. (c) Topographic image of a similar area acquired at t = 205 min. The region outlined by white lines was later covered by a thick disordered layer, as indicated by the white arrow in (a) and (b). In the ordered base layers, two sets of row-like structures existed; one set was oriented along a zigzag direction (indicated using pink arrows) of the HOPG substrate and the second was oriented along an arm-chair direction (indicated using blue arrows). The green arrow indicates areas with a disordered molecular layer. (d) Dissipation image acquired simultaneously with the image shown in (c). We note that primarily flat terraces and substrate step edges were observed when pre-degassed water was deposited on clean HOPG36, 37, 38. Domains of monolayer row-like patterns might appear, but the coverage was typically less than 10% of the interface after 8 hours of water deposition. Thus the 2D and 3D patterns shown here were produced by oxygen accumulating at the interface. Full size image View in article Figure 2: Height images of a HOPG-water interface acquired with PF mode after oxygen-supersaturated water was deposited. Peak forces of +100 pN (a), +250 pN (b), +650 pN (c), +1250 pN (d) were applied. The peak force was returned to100 pN in (e) and (f). In the region corresponding to the thick pancake-shaped layer, the tip penetrated through the disordered layer to image the underlying ordered base layers, which appeared approximately 0.5 nm lower than the surrounding ordered layers. Ordered structures, comprising two sets of three rotated row-like structures, were observed. One set with the rows oriented along the arm-chair directions is indicated using blue arrows and the second set, which was oriented along the zig-zag directions, is indicated with pink arrows. The outlined region in (f) indicates an area showing formation of new ordered structures. Full size image View in article Figure 3: Images of an HOPG-water interface acquired using the PF mode at approximately 4 hours after nitrogen-supersaturated water was deposited. (a), (c), (d), (e), and (f) are height images. The peak force used to acquire (a) and (b) was 150 pN. Peak forces of 750 pN (c), 1500 pN (d), and 2250 pN (e) were applied and, finally, the force was reduced to 150 pN (f). The apparent heights at the center of the cap-shaped structure in (a), (c), (d), (e) and (f) were 18.5 nm, 10.2 nm, 2.7 nm, 0.2\u20130.4 nm, and 12.6 nm, respectively. The left edge of the 3D nanostructure in (f) exhibited several changes after applying a peak force of 2250 pN. The real height of the cap-shaped nanostructure after the PF measurements was 20.3 nm, which was determined from the force curve measurements conducted at the center of the structure (see Supplementary Fig. S7). The domains of the row-like structure changed slowly with time. Furthermore, several domains exhibited damage at high peak forces (e.g., domains near the left edge of the cap-shaped structure). (b) is the corresponding adhesion map acquired along with (a). Both the cap-shaped nanostructure and the monolayer ordered structure appeared darker than the bare HOPG substrate. In (f), an increasing number of bright particles with heights ranging from 0.8 nm to 3 nm appeared after scanning with a high peak force.

For clarity, some structures may not be represented in the correct scale. Orange squares represent ordered structures; cap-shaped nanostructures and small nitrogen and oxygen clusters at the interface are shown in purple; 2D disordered layers are shown in yellow; and gas molecules dissolved in water are shown in red. Each red sphere represents an individual gas molecule and some molecules can aggregate into clusters in water.

        "text": "Combating illicit trafficking of Special Nuclear Material may require the ability to image through electromagnetic shields. This is the case when the trafficking involves cargo containers. Thus, suitable detection techniques are required to penetrate a ferromagnetic enclosure. The present study considers techniques that employ an electromagnetic based principle of detection. It is generally assumed that a ferromagnetic metallic enclosure will effectively act as a Faraday cage to electromagnetic radiation and therefore screen any form of interrogating electromagnetic radiation from penetrating, thus denying the detection of any eventual hidden material. In contrast, we demonstrate that it is actually possible to capture magnetic images of a conductive object through a set of metallic ferromagnetic enclosures. This validates electromagnetic interrogation techniques as a potential detection tool for National Nuclear Security applications.

Here, we report a new Li-Te secondary battery system with a redox potential of ~1.7 V (vs. Li+/Li) adapted on a Li metal anode and an advanced Te/C nanocomposite cathode. Using a simple concept of transforming TeO2 into nanocrystalline Te by mechanical reduction, we designed an advanced, mechanically reduced Te/C nanocomposite electrode material with high energy density (initial discharge/charge: 1088/740 mA h cm−3), excellent cyclability (ca. 705 mA h cm−3 over 100 cycles), and fast rate capability (ca. 550 mA h cm−3 at 5C rate). The mechanically reduced Te/C nanocomposite electrodes were found to be suitable for use as either the cathode in Li-Te secondary batteries or a high-potential anode in rechargeable Li-ion batteries. We firmly believe that the mechanically reduced Te/C nanocomposite constitutes a breakthrough for the realization and mass production of excellent energy storage systems.

        "text": "All-inorganic visibly-transparent energy-harvesting clear laminated glass windows are the most practical solution to boosting building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) energy outputs significantly while reducing cooling- and heating-related energy consumption in buildings. By incorporating luminophore materials into lamination interlayers and using spectrally-selective thin-film coatings in conjunction with CuInSe2 solar cells, most of the visible solar radiation can be transmitted through the glass window with minimum attenuation while ultraviolet (UV) radiation is down-converted and routed together with a significant part of infrared radiation to the edges for collection by solar cells. Experimental results demonstrate a 10 cm × 10 cm vertically-placed energy-harvesting clear glass panel of transparency exceeding 60%, invisible solar energy attenuation greater than 90% and electrical power output near 30 Wp/m2 mainly generated by infrared (IR) and UV radiations.

        "text": "The Ovonic Threshold Switch (OTS) based on an amorphous chalcogenide material has attracted much interest as a promising candidate for a high-performance thin-film switching device enabling 3D-stacking of memory devices. In this work, we studied on the electronic structure of amorphous Sb-doped Ge0.6Se0.4 (in atomic mole fraction) film and its characteristics as to OTS devices. From the optical absorption spectroscopy measurement, the band gap (Eg) was found to decrease with increasing Sb content. In addition, as Sb content increased, the activation energy (Ea) for electrical conduction was found to decrease down to about one third of Eg from a half. As to the device characteristics, we found that the threshold switching voltage (Vth) drastically decreased with the Sb content. These results, being accountable in terms of the changes in the bonding configuration of constituent atoms as well as in the electronic structure such as the energy gap and trap states, advance an effective method of compositional adjustment to modulate Vth of an OTS device for various applications.

As such, it is receiving additional focus to accelerate the commercialization process. To create a successful mass product, reliability issues must first be rigorously solved. In-depth understanding of the failure behavior of the ECM is essential for performance optimization. Here, we reveal the degradation of high resistance state behaves as the majority cases of the endurance failure of the HfO2 electrolyte based ECM cell. High resolution transmission electron microscopy was used to characterize the change in filament nature after repetitive switching cycles. The result showed that Cu accumulation inside the filament played a dominant role in switching failure, which was further supported by measuring the retention of cycle dependent high resistance state and low resistance state. The clarified physical picture of filament evolution provides a basic understanding of the mechanisms of endurance and retention failure, and the relationship between them. Based on these results, applicable approaches for performance optimization can be implicatively developed, ranging from material tailoring to structure engineering and algorithm design.

Under normal conditions, the protein exists as an autoinhibited monomer, but proapoptotic signals lead to its dimerization, activation and proteasomal degradation. This view of \u200bcIAP1 as a binary switch has been informed by static structural studies that cannot access the protein's dynamics. Here, we use NMR spectroscopy to study micro- and millisecond motions of specific domain interfaces in human \u200bcIAP1 and use time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering to observe the global conformational changes necessary for activation. Although motions within each interface of the 'closed' monomer are insufficient to activate \u200bcIAP1, they enable associations with catalytic partners and activation factors. We propose that these internal motions facilitate rapid peptide-induced opening and dimerization of \u200bcIAP1, which undergoes a dramatic spring-loaded structural transition.

(a) Ribbon diagram of monomeric \u200bcIAP1-B3R with residues with assigned resonances in the 1H-15N TROSY spectra of monomeric \u200bcIAP1-B3R depicted as spheres and residues displaying 15N R2 relaxation dispersion behavior in magenta. Zinc atoms are shown as light-gray spheres. (b) Relaxation data from residues in helix three of the UBA domain (UBA α3), fit to a single-exchange process with kex = 970 ± 100 s−1 and pB = 2.2 ± 0.1%, where kex is the exchange rate constant, pB is the equilibrium percent population of the excited state, VCPMG is the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill frequency and R2eff is the effective transverse relaxation rate constant. Fits representative at 900 MHz (red) and 800 MHz (blue) are shown for four residues. Dispersion profiles and fits for all residues in UBA α3 are shown in Supplementary Figure 4. (c) Structure showing UBA α3 packing against the BIR3-RING interface (in surface representation) and interacting with W329, a key residue involved in BIR3-RING interface stability and peptide binding. The hydrogen bond between the W329 side chain and the T419 carbonyl atom is shown as a dashed line. Figure 5: Standard SAXS data of closed, open and dimeric forms of \u200bcIAP1. (a) Standard SAXS scattering curves from \u200bcIAP1-B3R (closed monomer, blue), \u200bcIAP1-B3R-ΔC7 with 1 mM AVPW (open monomer, pink) and \u200bcIAP1-B3R with 1 mM AVPW (dimer, purple). Curves shown are averaged from ten 1-s exposures and are displayed without relative scaling. Data are representative of at least three observations collected at a range of concentrations. For the curves shown, all proteins are at concentrations of 1 mg/ml. I is scattering intensity, q is proportional to the scattering angle (q = 4 sin(θ)/λ, where 2θ is the angle between the incident X-ray beam and the detector, and λ is the X-ray wavelength in Å). (b) Standard SAXS scattering curves (as in a) from \u200bcIAP1-B3RL617E (closed monomer, blue) and \u200bcIAP1-B3RL617E with 1 mM AVPW (open monomer, pink). Data from \u200bcIAP1-B3R with 1 mM AVPW (dimer, purple) are shown for reference. (c) Ab initio models of three variants of \u200bcIAP1, shown in the presence and absence of AVPW. Each model represents the aligned, filtered average of ten independently calculated models (Online Methods). Models are colored according to conformational state: blue, closed monomer; pink, open monomer; purple, dimer. Figure 6: Monitoring peptide-induced conformational changes of \u200bcIAP1 by TR-SAXS. (a) Raw TR-SAXS scattering curves (green), shown at two different time points (after addition of 0.5 mM AVPW) and superimposed over static scattering curves of the three conformational states of \u200bcIAP1-B3R (blue, closed monomer; pink, open monomer; purple, dimer). Ab initio reconstructions for each standard state (as in Fig. 5c) are shown as insets. The relative populations of the closed, open and dimeric conformations of \u200bcIAP1-B3R were extracted from TR-SAXS data by deconvolution with the static scattering curves of each state as references (Online Methods). I is scattering intensity, and q is proportional to the scattering angle (q = 4 sin(θ)/λ, where 2θ is the angle between the incident X-ray beam and the detector, and λ is the X-ray wavelength in Å). (b,c) Deconvoluted populations of \u200bcIAP1-B3R (b) and the dimer-deficient mutant L617E (c), plotted as a function of time after mixture with AVPW. Data are shown as average ±s.d. (n = 5 technical replicates). Fits of the data are to single-exponential functions. (d) Observed rates (kobs) for \u200bcIAP1 construct transitions among the three main structural states; values are averages ±s.d. from 5 technical replicates for 0.5 mM AVPW or 3 technical replicates for 1 mM AVPW. Supplementary Fig. 1: Definition and assessment of \u200bcIAP1 constructs. (a) \u200bcIAP1 constructs used in this study are shown as primary structure schematics with domains colored as in the main text. Mutations and deletions are indicated with magenta lines. The mutations in the \u200bcIAP1-B3R construct reduce proteolysis and non-native disulfide formation1. (b) The binding of \u200bcIAP1-B3R (blue) and \u200bcIAP1-B3RMF-AA (gray) to monobiotinylated ubiquitin was tested using biolayer interferometry. Equilibrium response values are plotted against \u200bcIAP1 concentration. No detectable binding is observed by the \u200bcIAP1-B3RMF-AA construct. \u200bcIAP1-B3R binds ubiquitin with a KD of approximately 20 μM as determined by a single-site binding isotherm fit, in good agreement with past studies2. Recent reports have suggested that this mutation destabilizes \u200bcIAP13, which might contribute to the very slight decrease in E2 binding affinity we observe in the MF-AA variants. The use of \u200bcIAP1MF-AA in E2 binding studies removes the complicating effects of direct \u200bcIAP1-ubiquitin binding in the case of the E2-Ub conjugate. (c) The binding of \u200bcIAP1-B3R (blue) and \u200bcIAP1-B3R-ΔCARD (green) to E2SRCK was assessed using biolayer interferometry. Equilibrium response values were plotted as a function of E2 concentration, and the resulting curves were fit to a single-site binding isotherm. The affinities determined are approximately 27 μM (\u200bcIAP1-B3R) and 19 μM (\u200bcIAP1-B3R-ΔCARD), recapitulating the relative increase in affinity upon CARD deletion observed in the case of \u200bcIAP1-B3RMF-AA. Supplementary Fig. 2: \u200bUbcH5c does not induce dimerization of \u200bcIAP1. (a) \u200bcIAP1-B3R responds to \u200bSMAC mimetics by dimerizing, as detected by native gel electrophoresis. Lane 1 shows a native molecular weight marker (Native Mark, Invitrogen) with molecular weights indicated at left. Lane 2 shows monomeric \u200bcIAP1 (64 μM). Lane 3 shows dimerized \u200bcIAP1 in the presence of AVPW (1 mM). Binding of the bivalent \u200bSMAC mimetic BV6 (1 mM) induces stronger and more compact dimerization because it can engage two BIR3 domains simultaneously. Lanes 4-7 demonstrate that \u200bUbcH5c (64 μM) does not affect the dimerization state of \u200bcIAP1. Lanes 8-10 demonstrate that the gel mobility of \u200bUbcH5c is not affected by the \u200bSMAC mimetics. All samples contain 1% \u200bDMSO. (b) \u200bcIAP1-B3R (64 μM) was incubated with \u200bUbcH5c at 0 to 128 μM. No detectable dimer is formed. \u200bcIAP1 bound to BV6 is included as a dimerization control. Supplementary Fig. 3: \u200bMethionine methyl groups assigned by mutagenesis. 1H-13C HMQC spectra of each \u200bmethionine to \u200bleucine point mutant (blue) overlaid with the \u200bcIAP1-B3R spectrum (red). The M466L mutant is also shown with the contours drawn four times lower. The M266L, M391L, M392L, and M402L spectra display secondary chemical shift changes that may be due to structural perturbations as a result of the mutation. Supplementary Fig. 4: Dispersion profiles of UBA α3. The residues in UBA α3 were fit to a single exchange process with kex = 970 ± 100 s-1 and pB = 2.2 ± 0.1 %. Data and fits at 900 MHz are shown in red, 800 MHz data and fits are in blue. Error bars were determined by treating the spectral noise level as the uncertainty in peak heights. The two residues in UBA α3 that do not have detectable R2 dispersion, Q411 and L418, are severely overlapped in the 1H-15N spectra. As shown in Fig. 4a, R2 dispersion was also detected at additional residues in the UBA (A388, V389, M390, A399, F404, K425, D429 and I430) as well as at five additional residues outside the UBA domain (L359, T534, I548, V581 and I608); however, as the residues do not cluster into large, contiguous surfaces we did not fit the data to extract kinetic or equilibrium parameters describing the exchange processes. Supplementary Fig. 5: Characterization of the conformational states of \u200bcIAP1 variants. (a) Size-exclusion multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) traces of \u200bcIAP1 constructs with and without \u200bSMAC mimetics. Apo-proteins are shown in black, AVPW-bound protein in blue, and BV6 bound proteins (as a dimerization control) in red. The UV absorbance for each peak was normalized to 1. As expected, \u200bcIAP1-B3R (top) dimerizes in response to both AVPW and BV6, while \u200bcIAP1-B3R-ΔCARD (center) is constitutively open and dimerizes only in the presence of BV6. The L617E construct (bottom) blocks AVPW-induced dimerization without disrupting the closed conformation. (b) L617 is positioned in the RING dimerization interface. The structure of the \u200bcIAP2 RING dimer (PDB code: 3EB5, ref. 4) is shown in cartoon representation with the homologous residue to L617, L603, colored magenta and shown as spheres. Zinc ions are shown as light gray spheres. Supplementary Fig. 6: Standard SAXS models. Averaged, filtered SAXS models from 10 independent ab initio calculations are shown for \u200bcIAP1-B3R, \u200bcIAP1-B3R-∆C7 and \u200bcIAP1-B3RL617E with and without AVPW. Fits (dark blue lines) of the raw scattering data (red circles) to the best ab initio model from each set are shown. Chi values for those fits are also shown. Models were generated as described (see Methods) using GASBOR. Supplementary Fig. 7: Molecular models based on standard \u200bcIAP1 SAXS data. (a) The best of ten molecular models of \u200bcIAP1-B3R-ΔC7 is shown superposed with the averaged, filtered ab initio model. A normalized spatial discrepancy (NSD) for the aligment is indicated. The fit (dark blue line) of the molecular model to the experimental data (red circles) is shown below the model, and the Chi value describing the fit is indicated. I stands for scattering intensity and q is proportional to the scattering angle (q = 4 sin(θ)/λ, where 2θ = the angle between the incident X-ray beam and the detector, and λ = the X-ray wavelength in Ångstroms). (b) The same data as in (a) is shown for \u200bcIAP1-B3R-ΔC7 in the presence of 1 mM AVPW. (c, d) Constraints used in the generation of closed monomeric molecular models are shown. All constraints are based on mutational data1. (e) The best of ten molecular models of \u200bcIAP1-B3R is shown superposed with the averaged, filtered ab initio model, in two views. The NSD between the two models is indicated. (f) The fit of the best \u200bcIAP1-B3R molecular model to the experimental data is shown. All colors and variables are as in (a). (g) A subset of calculated molecular models for \u200bcIAP1-B3R is shown aligned by their BIR3 domains to demonstrate the heterogeneity of the position of the CARD. The protein likely exists as an ensemble of states not fully reflected by any single model. (h) The distributions of Rg values in the ensembles of molecular models generated by EOM for \u200bcIAP1-B3R (black), \u200bcIAP1-B3RL617E (orange), \u200bcIAP1-B3R-ΔC7 (violet) and \u200bcIAP1-B3RL617E + AVPW (green) are shown. The initial, unoptimized pools are displayed as dotted lines, and the optimized ensembles as solid lines. Note that the closed states (\u200bcIAP1-B3R and \u200bcIAP1-B3RL617E) adopt tighter and smaller distributions than the open states (\u200bcIAP1-B3R-ΔC7 and \u200bcIAP1-B3RL617E + AVPW), reflecting the more rigid conformation of the closed states. Supplementary Fig. 8: Controls for TR-SAXS measurements. (a,b) Time-resolved SAXS (TR-SAXS) experiments of \u200bcIAP1-B3R and \u200bcIAP1-B3RL617E mixed with buffer instead of AVPW. (c, d) TR-SAXS experiment of \u200bcIAP1-B3R-∆C7 mixed (c) with buffer and (d) with AVPW. (e) TR-SAXS analysis of \u200bcIAP1-B3RL617E with a higher concentration of AVPW (1 mM). The relative populations of the monomeric, open, and dimeric conformations of \u200bcIAP1 were extracted from the TR-SAXS data by deconvolution using the static scattering curves of each state as reference (See Methods). Each point represents and average from three experiments, plus or minus standard deviation. Data are fit to first order integrated rate equations. The closed monomer fraction is shown as blue squares, open fraction as hot pink circles, dimer fraction as purple diamonds.

        "text": "ATP, the universal energy currency of cells, is produced by F-type ATP synthases, which are ancient, membrane-bound nanomachines. F-type ATP synthases use the energy of a transmembrane electrochemical gradient to generate ATP by rotary catalysis. Protons moving across the membrane drive a rotor ring composed of 8\u201315 c-subunits1. A central stalk transmits the rotation of the c-ring to the catalytic F1 head, where a series of conformational changes results in ATP synthesis2. A key unresolved question in this fundamental process is how protons pass through the membrane to drive ATP production. Mitochondrial ATP synthases form V-shaped homodimers in cristae membranes3. Here we report the structure of a native and active mitochondrial ATP synthase dimer, determined by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy at 6.2 Å resolution. Our structure shows four long, horizontal membrane-intrinsic α-helices in the a-subunit, arranged in two hairpins at an angle of approximately 70° relative to the c-ring helices. It has been proposed that a strictly conserved membrane-embedded arginine in the a-subunit couples proton translocation to c-ring rotation4. A fit of the conserved carboxy-terminal a-subunit sequence places the conserved arginine next to a proton-binding c-subunit glutamate. The map shows a slanting solvent-accessible channel that extends from the mitochondrial matrix to the conserved arginine. Another hydrophilic cavity on the lumenal membrane surface defines a direct route for the protons to an essential histidine\u2013glutamate pair5. Our results provide unique new insights into the structure and function of rotary ATP synthases and explain how ATP production is coupled to proton translocation. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Electron cryomicroscopy map of the Polytomella F-type ATP synthase dimer. a, Side view. One half is fitted with atomic models of the F1 subcomplex (α-subunits, cyan; β-subunits, blue; γδε-subunits, grey; oligomycin-sensitivity-conferring protein, green; Protein Data Bank accession number 2WSS8) and the c-ring (yellow, c10-ring; Protein Data Bank accession number 3U2Y7). Density threshold levels are 1σ (mesh) or 7σ (solid surface). b, c, Cross-sections through the membrane domains as indicated in a, showing the c10 rotor ring surrounded by detergent (diffuse grey density in b) and six transmembrane helices per protomer. c, Horizontal a-subunit helices are visible as elongated white densities. d, e, Helix\u2013turn\u2013helix motif (blue) and Armadillo repeat-like density (pink) connecting the two protomers, viewed in the direction of the arrowheads in a. Scale bar, 100 Å. See also Supplementary Video 1. Figure 2: a-Subunit structure. a, Membrane-intrinsic helix hairpins of subunit a (blue) and c10-rotor ring (yellow) viewed from the dimer interface (see Supplementary Video 2). b, Matrix view of the c-ring (yellow; fitted atomic model, Protein Data Bank accession number 3U2Y7) and C-terminal hairpin of subunit a with fitted helices. Blue and red dotted circles indicate the approximate positions of interchangeable residue pairs aR239/aQ295 (ref. 17) (blue) and aE288/aH248 (ref. 5) (green). Red ribbon, prolines at helix ends. The dashed grey outline marks the aqueous matrix cavity. c, Orthogonal section through c-ring and the a-subunit four-helix bundle along the dashed line in b. In its proposed position, the strictly conserved aR239 (dark blue) interacts with proton-binding glutamates of the outer c-ring helices (red). Scale bar, 10 Å. Figure 3: Two aqueous half-channels. a, Left: side view of membrane domain in one protomer. Light blue, a-subunit helices; yellow, c-ring. The aqueous matrix cavity (boxed) is lined by amphipathic segments of the long hairpin helices and exposes the matrix ends of three c-subunits. Right: the aqueous matrix cavity narrows to a slit at the point where the a- and c-subunits interact (dark blue). b, Left: lumenal view of membrane region with aqueous cavity (boxed). Right: lumenal cavity with proposed position of interchangeable residue pair aE288/aH248 (green). Cross-sections along white lines in b, through the aqueous cavities on the matrix (c) and lumenal (d) side. Red arrows mark the proton paths into the lumenal (d) and out of the matrix (c) half-channels. Pink, detergent shell. Scale bar, 10 Å. See also Supplementary Video 3. Figure 4: Proton translocation through F-type ATP synthases. Protons (red) reach the conserved glutamate in the c-subunit via the aqueous lumenal half-channel (dashed grey circle). The proton competes with the strictly conserved aR239 (blue) for interaction with c-ring glutamates, which carry the proton around the c-ring. When the c-subunit approaches the hydrophilic half-channel on the matrix side (dashed grey outline), the glutamate becomes hydrated and adopts an open conformation, from which the proton can escape into the matrix. Solid grey circles indicate transmembrane helices. Extended Data Fig. 1: Oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity. ATPase assays27 performed with the Polytomella ATP synthase dimers used for electron cryomicroscopy data collection indicated high activity of 6\u20138 units per milligram protein, close to the reported activity for this complex27. ATPase activity was ~90% inhibited by oligomycin, indicating that the F1Fo complex is coupled. The vertical lines indicate addition of dodecyl maltoside detergent to initiate the reaction. Measurements were performed in triplicates for each purification. Extended Data Fig. 2: Projection images of the Polytomella F-type ATP synthase dimer. a, Typical electron cryo-micrograph of dimers in vitrified buffer recorded at 2.5 µm underfocus. b, Two-dimensional class averages and (c) corresponding projection images calculated from the final three-dimensional volume. d, Angular distribution of projection images used for three-dimensional reconstruction. ATP synthase dimers are oriented randomly in the thin layer of vitrified buffer. Scale bar in a, 50 nm. Extended Data Fig. 3: Local resolution estimates. a, The unfiltered electron cryomicroscopy map was analysed with the programme ResMap38 to assess local resolution. The catalytic F1 head (red to green) is less well-ordered than the peripheral stalk and the membrane-embedded a-subunit (green to blue), as indicated by the rainbow colour code on the left. The insets show cross-sections through the density at the levels indicated on the right. b, Fourier shell correlation curves calculated from two independently refined data sets after soft masking. The resolution was 7.0 Å for the whole complex (red), 7.4 Å for the F1/c-ring complex (blue mask and curve) and 6.2 Å for the peripheral stalk and a-subunit (yellow mask and curve). Extended Data Fig. 4: Resolution of unsymmetrized map. Side view (a) and top view (b) of the dimer map refined without imposing c2 symmetry (blue). c, The gold-standard Fourier shell correlation curve indicates a resolution of 8.0 Å for the unsymmetrized map, which shows all essential features of the Polytomella dimer, including c2 symmetry. Extended Data Fig. 5: Horizontal helices in the three-dimensional map and in two-dimensional projection. a, Section of the three-dimensional map showing a side view of the c10-ring on the left and the a-subunit on the right. b, A slice of the three-dimensional map volume indicated in a shows the horizontal helices clearly. c, In a two-dimensional map generated by projecting the three-dimensional map volume in a along the indicated direction (arrow), the long horizontal helices are in effect invisible, whereas the vertical c-ring helices stand out clearly. Scale bar, 10 Å. Extended Data Fig. 6: Sequence alignment of about 120 C-terminal subunit a residues. Sequences of bacterial (blue), mitochondrial (red) and chloroplast (green) F-type ATP synthases are compared. The interchangeable residue pairs aR239/aQ295 and aE288/aH248 are dark blue and green, respectively; sequences of helices fitted in Fig. 2b are light blue. The black arrowhead marks the strictly conserved arginine essential for coupled proton translocation. Red, prolines; magenta, solvent-exposed residues18, 43; green, residues that crosslink to the c-ring10, 11. Identical (⋆) or similar (\u2018.\u2019 or \u2018:\u2019) residues are indicated. Extended Data Fig. 7: Subunit a and c crosslinking distances. Pairs of a- and c-subunit residues crosslinked in E. coli using (a) zero-length crosslinkers10 and (b) bis-MTS reagents11. Tabulated distances were measured between beta carbons of residues in the modelled a-subunit helices and Saccharomyces c-ring helices fitted to the map. Zero-length crosslinks can be considerably shorter than crystallographic distances44, 45, most probably as a result of thermal motion during the long incubation times required for crosslinking10. Nevertheless, the inter-residue distances in our model agree with the E. coli crosslinking data within reasonable margins, allowing for species differences between bacterial and mitochondrial ATP synthases.

Video 4: Solvent-exposed residues in the matrix cavity Residues of the E. coli a subunit equivalent to Polytomellaa225, 226, 228, 229, 231, 232, 235, 303 and 306-30820,43, as well as c-ring residues equivalent to Polytomella c44-6621 have been shown to be solvent exposed by cysteine mutagenesis. In our model, residues a225-235 (red), a303-308 (orange) and c44-66 (green) line the aqueous matrix cavity observed in the EM map of the Polytomella ATP synthase dimer. Thus our model is in excellent agreement with published biochemical studies on the solvent accessibility of a-subunit residues. Blue, a-subunit; yellow, c-ring; pink mesh, detergent shell; dark blue, location of conserved arginine.

        "text": "Organic solar cells (OSCs) offer the possibility of harnessing the sun's ubiquitous energy in a low-cost, environmentally friendly and renewable manner. OSCs based on small molecule semiconductors (SMOSCs) \u2013 have made a substantial improvement in recent years and are now achieving power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) that match those achieved for polymer:fullerene OSCs. To date, all efficient SMOSCs have relied on the same fullerene acceptor, PCBM, in order to achieve high performance. The use of PCBM however, is unfavourable due to its low lying LUMO level, which limits the open-circuit voltage (VOC). Alternative fullerene derivatives with higher lying LUMOs are thus required to improve the VOC. The challenge, however, is to prevent the typical concomitant decrease in the short circuit current density (JSC) when using a higher LUMO fullerene. In this communication, we address the issue by applying methano indene fullerene, MIF, a bis-functionalised C60 fullerene that has a LUMO level 140 mV higher than PCBM, in solution processed SMOSCs with a well known small molecule donor, DPP(TBFu)2. MIF-based devices show an improved VOC of 140 mV over PC61BM and only a small decrease in the JSC, with the PCE increasing to 5.1% (vs. 4.5% for PC61BM).

Here, 3D porous PdNi@Pt core-shell nanostructures (CSNSs) are facilely synthesized by first preparing the Pd-Ni alloy networks (Pd-Ni ANWs) core via cyanogel-reduction method followed by a galvanic displacement reaction to generate the Pt-rich shell.

        "text": "Finding new ways to control and slow down the group velocity of light in media remains a major challenge in the field of optics. For the design of plasmonic slow light structures, graphene represents an attractive alternative to metals due to its strong field confinement, comparably low ohmic loss and versatile tunability. Here we propose a novel nanostructure consisting of a monolayer graphene on a silicon based graded grating structure. An external gate voltage is applied to graphene and silicon, which are separated by a spacer layer of silica. Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate that the structure exhibits an ultra-high slowdown factor above 450 for the propagation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) excited in graphene, which also enables the spatially resolved trapping of light. Slowdown and trapping occur in the mid-infrared wavelength region within a bandwidth of ~2.1 μm and on a length scale less than 1/6 of the operating wavelength. The slowdown factor can be precisely tuned simply by adjusting the external gate voltage, offering a dynamic pathway for the release of trapped SPPs at room temperature. The presented results will enable the development of highly tunable optoelectronic devices such as plasmonic switches and buffers.

        "text": "Holography - originally developed for correcting spherical aberration in transmission electron microscopes - is now used in a wide range of disciplines that involve the propagation of waves, including light optics, electron microscopy, acoustics and seismology. In electron microscopy, the two primary modes of holography are Gabor's original in-line setup and an off-axis approach that was developed subsequently. These two techniques are highly complementary, offering superior phase sensitivity at high and low spatial resolution, respectively. All previous investigations have focused on improving each method individually. Here, we show how the two approaches can be combined in a synergetic fashion to provide phase information with excellent sensitivity across all spatial frequencies, low noise and an efficient use of electron dose. The principle is also expected to be widely to applications of holography in light optics, X-ray optics, acoustics, ultra-sound, terahertz imaging, etc. Subject terms: Materials science\u2022 Transmission electron microscopy\u2022 Nanoscale materials At a glance Figures View all figures Figure 1: Schematic view of microscope setups: (a) off-axis and (b) in-line electron holography.(c) Shows how the in-line data can be acquired immediately after switching off the biprism, in a fully automated fashion by simply shifting the image.

        "text": "Hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (h-BNNS) have been proposed as an ideal substrate for graphene-based electronic devices, but the synthesis of large and homogeneous h-BNNS is still challenging. In this contribution, we report a facile synthesis of few-layer h-BNNS on melted copper via an atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition process. Comparative studies confirm the advantage of using melted copper over solid copper as a catalyst substrate. The former leads to the formation of single crystalline h-BNNS that is several microns in size and mostly in mono- and bi-layer forms, in contrast to the polycrystalline and mixed multiple layers (1\u201310) yielded by the latter. This difference is likely to be due to the significantly reduced and uniformly distributed nucleation sites on the smooth melted surface, in contrast to the large amounts of unevenly distributed nucleation sites that are associated with grain boundaries and other defects on the solid surface.

        "text": "Nanodiamond (ND) has emerged as a promising carbon nanomaterial for therapeutic applications. In previous studies, ND has been reported to have outstanding biocompatibility and high uptake rate in various cell types. ND containing nitrogen-vacancy centers exhibit fluorescence property is called fluorescent nanodiamond (FND), and has been applied for bio-labeling agent. However, the influence and application of FND on the nervous system remain elusive. In order to study the compatibility of FND on the nervous system, neurons treated with FNDs in vitro and in vivo were examined. FND did not induce cytotoxicity in primary neurons from either central (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS); neither did intracranial injection of FND affect animal behavior. The neuronal uptake of FNDs was confirmed using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. However, FND caused a concentration-dependent decrease in neurite length in both CNS and PNS neurons. Time-lapse live cell imaging showed that the reduction of neurite length was due to the spatial hindrance of FND on advancing axonal growth cone. These findings demonstrate that FNDs exhibit low neuronal toxicity but interfere with neuronal morphogenesis, and should be taken into consideration when applications involve actively growing neurites (e.g. nerve regeneration).

        "text": "Ferroelectric perovskite oxides possess large electrocaloric effect, but only at high temperature, which limits their potential as next generation solid state cooling devices. Here, we demonstrate from phase field simulations that a giant adiabatic temperature change exhibits near room temperature in the strained ferroelectric PbTiO3 nanotubes, which is several times in magnitude larger than that of PbTiO3 thin films. Such giant adiabatic temperature change is attributed to the extrinsic contribution of unusual domain transition, which involves a dedicated interplay among the electric field, strain, temperature and polarization. Careful selection of external strain allows one to harness the extrinsic contribution to obtain large adiabatic temperature change in ferroelectric nanotubes near room temperature. Our finding provides a novel insight into the electrocaloric response of ferroelectric nanostructures and leads to a new strategy to tailor and improve the electrocaloric properties of ferroelectric materials through domain engineering.

        "text": "The Boltzmann distribution of electrons poses a fundamental barrier to lowering energy dissipation in conventional electronics, often termed as Boltzmann Tyranny1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Negative capacitance in ferroelectric materials, which stems from the stored energy of a phase transition, could provide a solution, but a direct measurement of negative capacitance has so far been elusive1, 2, 3. Here, we report the observation of negative capacitance in a thin, epitaxial ferroelectric film. When a voltage pulse is applied, the voltage across the ferroelectric capacitor is found to be decreasing with time\u2014in exactly the opposite direction to which voltage for a regular capacitor should change. Analysis of this \u2018inductance\u2019-like behaviour from a capacitor presents an unprecedented insight into the intrinsic energy profile of the ferroelectric material and could pave the way for completely new applications.

        "text": "Repeatability of the responsiveness with time is one important concern for effective durable functions of stimuli-responsive materials. Although the increase in the yield and tensile strength of the hybrid composite materials by nanoparticle (NP) incorporation has been reported, exact NP effect on stimuli-responsiveness is rarely reported. In this study, a set of nanoscale actuating system is demonstrated by a thermo-sensitive process operated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) linked by gold nanoparticle (AuNP). This designed nanocomposite exclusively provides an artificial on/off gate function for selective passages of permeate molecules. The results demonstrate high repetition efficiency with sharp responding in a timely manner. In terms of the morphology changes induced by repeated swelling-deswelling mechanics, the nanocomposite exhibits phase separation between AuNP clusters and PEG domains. This leads to a delay in responsiveness in a cumulative way with time. Acting as stable junction points in the nanocomposite network structures, the incorporated AuNPs contribute to maintain repeatability in responsiveness. This study contributes to new-concept smart material design and fundamental understanding on the hybrid nanomaterials for various applications in terms of a dynamic mechanical behavior.

There is a critical q value (marked by q*) from which temperature-responsiveness is diversified indicating dual regions of the designed network: stable large scale domain and responsive small scale domain.

        "text": "The structure of water near non-polar molecular fragments or surfaces mediates the hydrophobic interactions that underlie a broad range of interfacial, colloidal and biophysical phenomena1, 2, 3, 4. Substantial progress over the past decade has improved our understanding of hydrophobic interactions in simple model systems1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, but most biologically and technologically relevant structures contain non-polar domains in close proximity to polar and charged functional groups. Theories and simulations exploring such nanometre-scale chemical heterogeneity find it can have an important effect8, 10, 11, 12, but the influence of this heterogeneity on hydrophobic interactions has not been tested experimentally. Here we report chemical force microscopy measurements on alkyl-functionalized surfaces that reveal a dramatic change in the surfaces\u2019 hydrophobic interaction strengths on co-immobilization of amine or guanidine groups. Protonation of amine groups doubles the strength of hydrophobic interactions, and guanidinium groups eliminate measurable hydrophobic interactions in all pH ranges investigated. We see these divergent effects of proximally immobilized cations also in single-molecule measurements on conformationally stable β-peptides with non-polar subunits located one nanometre from either amine- or guanidine-bearing subunits. Our results demonstrate the importance of nanometre-scale chemical heterogeneity, with hydrophobicity not an intrinsic property of any given non-polar domain but strongly modulated by functional groups located as far away as one nanometre. The judicious placing of charged groups near hydrophobic domains thus provides a strategy for tuning hydrophobic driving forces to optimize molecular recognition or self-assembly processes.

        "text": "The influence of the growth conditions of multilayer CdTe/ZnTe quantum dots (QDs) on Si substrate upon their carrier dynamics is studied using intensity integration and broadening photoluminescence. The unusual temperature dependence of the line broadening is explained using a model for interband transitions that involves a lowest discrete electronic state (1Se) with different discrete hole states (1S3/2 and 2S3/2) and a 1P transition. These transitions are expected to play a critical role in both the thermally activated energy and the line broadening of the QDs. We also demonstrate that a thermally activated transition between two different states occurs with band low-temperature quenching, with values separated by 5.8\u201316 meV. The main nonradiative process is thermal escape assisted by carrier scattering via emission of longitudinal phonons through the hole states at high temperature, with an average energy of 19.3\u201320.2 meV.

        "text": "Surface organic residues inhibit the extraordinary electronic properties of graphene, hindering the development of graphene electronics. However, fundamental understanding of the residue morphology is still absent due to a lack of high-throughput and high-resolution surface characterization methods. Here, we demonstrate that secondary electron (SE) imaging in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and helium ion microscope (HIM) can provide sub-nanometer information of a graphene surface and reveal the morphology of surface contaminants. Nanoscale polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) residues are visible in the SE imaging, but their contrast, i.e. the apparent lateral dimension, varies with the imaging conditions. We have demonstrated a quantitative approach to readily obtain the physical size of the surface features regardless of the contrast variation. The fidelity of SE imaging is ultimately determined by the probe size of the primary beam. HIM is thus evaluated to be a superior SE imaging technique in terms of surface sensitivity and image fidelity. A highly efficient method to reveal the residues on a graphene surface has therefore been established.

(f) The size distribution of the dark dots observed in the different imaging conditions. The dots observed in a finely focused 35 keV HIM image (Figure 2a) have small size values. The dots observed in a 0.5 keV SEM image (Figure 2b) and an over-focused 35 keV HIM image (Figure 3d) have similar size values due to their close probe size values.

        "text": "Magnetic thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy have localized excitations that correspond to reversed, dynamically precessing magnetic moments, which are known as magnetic droplet solitons. Fundamentally, these excitations are associated with an attractive interaction between elementary spin-excitations and have been predicted to occur in perpendicularly magnetized materials in the absence of damping1, 2. Although damping suppresses these excitations, it can be compensated by spin-transfer torques when an electrical current flows in nanocontacts to ferromagnetic thin films3, 4. Theory predicts the appearance of magnetic droplet solitons in nanocontacts at a threshold current5 and, recently, experimental signatures of droplet nucleation have been reported6. However, to date, these solitons have been observed to be nearly reversible excitations, with only partially reversed magnetization6. Here, we show that magnetic droplet solitons exhibit a strong hysteretic response in field and current, proving the existence of bistable states: droplet and non-droplet states. In the droplet soliton state we find that the magnetization in the contact is almost fully reversed. These observations, in addition to their fundamental interest, are important to understanding and controlling droplet motion, nucleation and annihilation7, 8, 9. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Device schematic and dynamical properties. a, Schematic of a magnetic droplet in an STNO. An electrical current flows through a nanocontact to a thin ferromagnetic layer (the free layer, FL) and spin-polarizing layer. The external magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the film plane (the z-direction). The droplet is a nearly reversed magnetization region with spins precessing in the x\u2013y plane. Blue arrows correspond to the magnetization of the free layer (CoNi) and pink arrows to the magnetization of the polarizing layer (Py). b,c, High-frequency spectra as a function of current in a 150-nm-diameter contact with applied fields of μ0H = 0.4 and 0.55 T (b) and μ0H = 0.8 T (c), showing both field swept-up and swept-down measurements. The colour scale is dB above the baseline noise. The insets with the blue and pink arrows represent the relative configuration of the magnetization of the two layers. Hysteresis is found, as indicated by the vertical dashed lines. Figure 2: Nucleation of droplet solitons with current. a, Magnetoresistance (MR) of a 150-nm-diameter STNO versus field with I = 5 mA (blue). The dashed red curve shows the expected MR for a reversed CoNi magnetization (magnetization anti-aligned with the applied field). b, MR as a function of applied current for fields ranging from μ0H = 0.5 T to 1.4 T. Curves are shifted vertically for clarity. c, Expanded MR curves from b, for fields of μ0H = 0.6 T and 0.9 T, with the onset of spin-wave excitations (left inset) and the droplet state (right inset) indicated. d, Resistance step ΔR (as a percentage) on droplet soliton nucleation as a function of applied field. The black curve is the expected maximum MR of the STNO as a function of the applied field, MR = R0H/Ms, where R0 = 0.9% and μ0Ms = 1.1 T. In the insets the light blue and pink arrows represent the magnetic moments of CoNi and Py. CoNi arrows that represent droplet soliton states are outlined in red throughout. Figure 3: Hysteresis in the MR data. a, MR curves as a function of the perpendicular applied field for currents of I = 25.5 mA (top) and I = 32.5 mA (bottom). Insets: Light blue and pink arrows represent the orientations of the magnetization in CoNi and Py. CoNi arrows that represent droplet soliton states are outlined in red. b, Stability map of droplet solitons: red circles show annihilation with increasing H, orange squares show annihilation with decreasing I, blue circles show onset with decreasing H, and cyan squares show onset with increasing I. Dashed lines correspond to fits to a macrospin model with a spin-torque asymmetry of λ2 = 1.8 (see main text). c, MR curves as a function of the in-plane field Hx for a current of I = 26 mA. The three curves correspond to perpendicular applied fields of 2.0 T (blue), 2.1 T (green) and 2.2 T (red). The STNOs have a diameter of 150 nm.

        "text": "We report a cholesterol imaging method using rationally synthesized phenyl-diyne cholesterol (PhDY-Chol) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscope. The phenyl-diyne group is biologically inert and provides a Raman scattering cross section that is 88 times larger than the endogenous C = O stretching mode. SRS microscopy offers an imaging speed that is faster than spontaneous Raman microscopy by three orders of magnitude, and a detection sensitivity of 31 μM PhDY-Chol (~1,800 molecules in the excitation volume). Inside living CHO cells, PhDY-Chol mimics the behavior of cholesterol, including membrane incorporation and esterification. In a cellular model of Niemann-Pick type C disease, PhDY-Chol reflects the lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol, and shows relocation to lipid droplets after HPβCD treatment. In live C. elegans, PhDY-Chol mimics cholesterol uptake by intestinal cells and reflects cholesterol storage. Together, our work demonstrates an enabling platform for study of cholesterol storage and trafficking in living cells and vital organisms.

The Cccm structure is favorable with partial hydrogen bond symmetrization above 37 GPa. Upon further compression, H2 molecules disappear and two intriguing metallic structures with R3m and Im-3m symmetries are reconstructive above 111 and 180 GPa, respectively.

However, many of the proposed structures are designed without incorporating a key phenomenon known as topological frustration, which leads to localized non-bonding states (free radicals), increasing chemical reactivity and instability. By applying graph theory, we demonstrate that topological frustrations can be avoided while simultaneously preserving spin ordering, thus providing alternative spintronic designs. Using tight-binding calculations, we show that all original functionality is not only maintained but also enhanced, resulting in the theoretically highest performing devices in the literature today. Furthermore, it is shown that eliminating armchair regions between zigzag edges significantly improves spintronic properties such as magnetic coupling. Subject terms: Theory and computation\u2022 Spintronics At a glance Figures View all figures Figure 1: (a) Kekulé structure of a triangular zigzag graphene nanoflake (TZGNF). No matter how the double bonds are arranged, at least two atoms will always be lacking a double bond, leading to the creation of free radicals (or topological frustrations, in this case two). This phenomenon can be quantified with a concept borrowed from graph theory known as maximal matching. (b) Bow-tie graphene nanoflake, or Clar's goblet. Note that the topological frustrations can exist on the interior or the edge atoms (as long as they belong to the given sublattice, for the structures presented here), and there are many more arrangements of the Kekulé structure possible. (c) If we connect the TZGNF from (a) with its mirror image, we arrive at structure (c) which has no topological frustration. The free radicals were able to recombine and form stable double bonds.

The regions labeled A and B are the inputs, while D is the output, and C is a programmable bit. Devices (a) and (b) each can function as NOR or NAND gates, depending on the value of the programmable bit. Both devices also have valid Kekulé structures (no topological frustrations or free radicals), and both have the highest magnetic coupling values of their respective families (demonstrated in Figure 3).

In the example structure images the structure index n is three. Up spin on-site occupation is in blue, down spin occupation in red, and half/half up/down occupation in white. It is apparent that the majority of the spin polarization occurs on the zigzag edges. Note that the axis scaling is different between the NOT and NOR/NAND gates. The best performing device for each structure family have magnetic couplings of: (a) 135 meV (b) 179 meV (c) 93 meV and (d) 113 meV, well above the 18 meV bare minimum threshold imposed by thermal fluctuations at room temperature (denoted as an orange horizontal line).

        "text": "Many potential industrial, medical, and environmental applications of metal nanorods rely on the physics and resultant kinetics and dynamics of the interaction of these particles with light. We report a surprising kinetics transition in the global melting of femtosecond laser-driven gold nanorod aqueous colloidal suspension. At low laser intensity, the melting exhibits a stretched exponential kinetics, which abruptly transforms into a compressed exponential kinetics when the laser intensity is raised. It is found the relative formation and reduction rate of intermediate shapes play a key role in the transition. Supported by both molecular dynamics simulations and a kinetic model, the behavior is traced back to the persistent heterogeneous nature of the shape dependence of the energy uptake, dissipation and melting of individual nanoparticles. These results could have significant implications for various applications such as water purification and electrolytes for energy storage that involve heat transport between metal nanorod ensembles and surrounding solvents.

        "text": "This study investigated the elastic deformation behaviour of Nb nanowires embedded in a NiTi matrix. The Nb nanowires exhibited an ultra-large elastic deformation, which is found to be dictated by the martensitic transformation of the NiTi matrix, thus exhibiting unique characteristics of locality and rapidity. These are in clear contrast to our conventional observation of elastic deformations of crystalline solids, which is a homogeneous lattice distortion with a strain rate controlled by the applied strain. The Nb nanowires are also found to exhibit elastic-plastic deformation accompanying the martensitic transformation of the NiTi matrix in the case when the transformation strain of the matrix over-matches the elastic strain limit of the nanowires, or exhibit only elastic deformation in the case of under-matching. Such insight provides an important opportunity for elastic strain engineering and composite design.

While research on various 3D phases of carbon has been extensive, 2D allotropes formed from stable rings are yet to be unearthed. Here, we report a new sp2 hybridized two-dimensional allotrope consisting of continuous 5-6-8 rings of carbon atoms, named as \u201cpentahexoctite\u201d. The absence of unstable modes in the phonon spectra ensures the stability of the planar sheet. Furthermore, this sheet has mechanical strength comparable to graphene.

        "text": "Asymmetric catalysis is seen as one of the most economical strategies to satisfy the growing demand for enantiomerically pure small molecules in the fine chemical and pharmaceutical industries1. And visible light has been recognized as an environmentally friendly and sustainable form of energy for triggering chemical transformations and catalytic chemical processes2, 3, 4, 5. For these reasons, visible-light-driven catalytic asymmetric chemistry is a subject of enormous current interest2, 3, 4, 5. Photoredox catalysis provides the opportunity to generate highly reactive radical ion intermediates with often unusual or unconventional reactivities under surprisingly mild reaction conditions6. In such systems, photoactivated sensitizers initiate a single electron transfer from (or to) a closed-shell organic molecule to produce radical cations or radical anions whose reactivities are then exploited for interesting or unusual chemical transformations. However, the high reactivity of photoexcited substrates, intermediate radical ions or radicals, and the low activation barriers for follow-up reactions provide significant hurdles for the development of efficient catalytic photochemical processes that work under stereochemical control and provide chiral molecules in an asymmetric fashion7. Here we report a highly efficient asymmetric catalyst that uses visible light for the necessary molecular activation, thereby combining asymmetric catalysis and photocatalysis. We show that a chiral iridium complex can serve as a sensitizer for photoredox catalysis and at the same time provide very effective asymmetric induction for the enantioselective alkylation of 2-acyl imidazoles. This new asymmetric photoredox catalyst, in which the metal centre simultaneously serves as the exclusive source of chirality, the catalytically active Lewis acid centre, and the photoredox centre, offers new opportunities for the \u2018green\u2019 synthesis of non-racemic chiral molecules.

        "text": "Photonic simulations of quantum Hall edge states and topological insulators have inspired considerable interest in recent years. Interestingly, there are theoretical predictions for another type of topological states in topological superconductors, but debates over their experimental observations still remain. Here we investigate the photonic analogue of the px + ipy model of topological superconductor. Two essential characteristics of topological superconductor, particle-hole symmetry and px + ipy pairing potentials, are well emulated in photonic systems. Its topological features are presented by chiral edge state and zero-energy mode at a vortex. This work may fertilize the study of photonic topological states, and open up the possibility for emulating wave behaviors in superconductors.

        "text": "The excellent mechanical properties of natural biomaterials have attracted intense attention from researchers with focus on the strengthening and toughening mechanisms. Nevertheless, no material is unconquerable under sufficiently high load. If fracture is unavoidable, constraining the damage scope turns to be a practical way to preserve the integrity of the whole structure. Recent studies on biomaterials have revealed that many structural biomaterials tend to be fractured, under sufficiently high indentation load, through ring cracking which is more localized and hence less destructive compared to the radial one. Inspired by this observation, here we explore the factors affecting the fracture mode of structural biomaterials idealized as laminated materials. Our results suggest that fracture mode of laminated materials depends on the coating/substrate modulus mismatch and the indenter size. A map of fracture mode is developed, showing a critical modulus mismatch (CMM), below which ring cracking dominates irrespective of the indenter size. Many structural biomaterials in nature are found to have modulus mismatch close to the CMM. Our results not only shed light on the mechanics of inclination to ring cracking exhibited by structural biomaterials but are of great value to the design of laminated structures with better persistence of structural integrity.

Herein, we report a comparative study of nitrogen-doping-induced defects in Cu2O. Even in the lightly doped samples, a considerable number of nitrogen interstitials (Ni) formed, accompanied by nitrogen substitutions (NO) and oxygen vacancies (VO). In the course of high-temperature annealing, these Ni atoms interacted with VO, resulting in an increase in NO and decreases in Ni and VO. The properties of the annealed sample were significantly modified as a result. Our results suggest that Ni is a significant defect type in nitrogen-doped Cu2O.

        "text": "Giant chiroptical responses routinely occur in three dimensional chiral metamaterials (MMs), but their resonance elements with complex subwavelength chiral shapes are challenging to fabricate in the optical region. Here, we propose a new paradigm for obtaining strong circular conversion dichroism (CCD) based on extrinsic 2D chirality in multilayer achiral MMs, showing that giant chiroptical response can be alternatively attained without complex structures. Our structure consists of an array of thin Au squares separated from a continuous Au film by a GaAs dielectric layer, where the Au squares occupy the sites of a rectangular lattice. This structure gives rise to a pronounced extrinsically 2D-chiral effect (CCD) in the mid-infrared (M-IR) region under an oblique incidence, where the 2D-chiral effect is due to the mutual orientation of the Au squares array and the incident light propagation direction; the large magnitude of CCD due to the large difference between left-to-left and right-to-right circularly polarized reflectance conversion efficiencies.

        "text": "Rubber-filler composites are a key component in the manufacture of tyres. The filler provides mechanical reinforcement and additional wear resistance to the rubber, but it in turn introduces non-linear mechanical behaviour to the material which most likely arises from interactions between the filler particles, mediated by the rubber matrix. While various studies have been made on the bulk mechanical properties and of the filler network structure (both imaging and by simulations), there presently does not exist any work directly linking filler particle spacing and mechanical properties. Here we show that using STEM tomography, aided by a machine learning image analysis procedure, to measure silica particle spacings provides a direct link between the inter-particle spacing and the reduction in shear modulus as a function of strain (the Payne effect), measured using dynamic mechanical analysis. Simulations of filler network formation using attractive, repulsive and non-interacting potentials were processed using the same method and compared with the experimental data, with the net result being that an attractive inter-particle potential is the most accurate way of modelling styrene-butadiene rubber-silica composite formation.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information The tunability of topological surface states and controllable opening of the Dirac gap are of fundamental and practical interest in the field of topological materials. In the newly discovered topological crystalline insulators (TCIs), theory predicts that the Dirac node is protected by a crystalline symmetry and that the surface state electrons can acquire a mass if this symmetry is broken. Recent studies have detected signatures of a spontaneously generated Dirac gap in TCIs; however, the mechanism of mass formation remains elusive. In this work, we present scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) measurements of the TCI Pb1−xSnxSe for a wide range of alloy compositions spanning the topological and non-topological regimes. The STM topographies reveal a symmetry-breaking distortion on the surface, which imparts mass to the otherwise massless Dirac electrons\u2014a mechanism analogous to the long sought-after Higgs mechanism in particle physics. Interestingly, the measured Dirac gap decreases on approaching the trivial phase, whereas the magnitude of the distortion remains nearly constant. Our data and calculations reveal that the penetration depth of Dirac surface states controls the magnitude of the Dirac mass. At the limit of the critical composition, the penetration depth is predicted to go to infinity, resulting in zero mass, consistent with our measurements. Finally, we discover the existence of surface states in the non-topological regime, which have the characteristics of gapped, double-branched Dirac fermions and could be exploited in realizing superconductivity in these materials.

STM set-up conditions are: Iset = 300 pA, Vset = − 200 mV (a); Iset = 385 pA, Vset = 70 mV (b); Iset = 540 pA, Vset = 50 mV (c); Iset = 350 pA, Vset = 50 mV (d).

Orange lines in c-e represent guides for the eye. The width of the orange lines are for visualization purposes only. Vertical error bars in c,d are explained in Supplementary Discussions III and V, respectively. Figure 5: Evolution of band structure with alloy composition. a, Schematic phase diagram of TCIs. The bandgap between the conduction (CB) and valence bands (VB) closes at a critical Sn concentration xc of approximately 0.18 (ref. 14), causing band inversion and the formation of topologically protected SS consisting of two Dirac cones centred at each and point. The question mark denotes one of the unknowns in the field regarding what surface states, if any, appear on the trivial side, and how they relate to their topological counterparts. b, Evolution of band structure parameters as a function of Sn composition. Average SS dispersion velocity assuming isotropic momentum dispersion, 2Δ and the energy of the Lifshitz transition are shown as green squares, yellow circles and blue triangles, respectively. Horizontal error bars denote the standard deviation in EDS measurements of Sn composition from five different areas of each sample. Vertical error bars are explained in Supplementary Discussion III. Figure 6: Evolution of SS across the topological quantum phase transition. a\u2013d, Plots of LL dispersion before (a), at (b) and after (c,d) the topological transition. The double-branch dispersion in a shows the proximity state without the Dirac node, which is clearly observed in topological samples in b\u2013d. Two Dirac cones are nearly indistinguishable in b, but become increasingly offset in energy with increasing Sn content (c,d). Non-dispersing E∗ peaks in c,d (white circles), are absent in the transition sample in b, which allows us to visualize the effect of composition changes on the Dirac gap, a property directly related to the Dirac fermion mass. Orange lines in a\u2013d schematically depict the low-energy SS dispersions. Grey shaded regions indicate the positions of the bulk bands determined from ref. 14. Fits to the k ⋅ p model34 are shown in Supplementary Discussion V. e\u2013h, Illustrations of the SS band structure around the point in the absence of symmetry-breaking surface distortion, showing its evolution from the trivial to the topological regime. The absence of separate E+∗ and E−∗ peaks at the transition point x ~ 0.17 (Fig. 3b) suggests that Δ is approximately zero at this concentration.

        "text": "The mouse lens capsular injury model has been widely used in investigating the mechanisms of anterior subcapsular cataract (ASC) and posterior capsule opacification (PCO), and evaluating the efficacy of antifibrotic compounds. Nevertheless, there is no available protocol to quantitatively assess the treatment outcomes. Our aim is to describe a new method that can successfully quantify the wound and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers expression in vivo. In this model, lens anterior capsule was punctured with a hypodermic needle, which triggered lens epithelial cells (LECs) proliferation and EMT rapidly. Immunofluorescent staining of injured lens anterior capsule whole-mounts revealed the formation of ASC and high expression of EMT markers in the subcapsular plaques. A series of sectional images of lens capsule were acquired from laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) three-dimensional (3D) scanning. Using LSCM Image Browser software, we can not only obtain high resolution stereo images to present the spatial structures of ASC, but also quantify the subcapsular plaques and EMT markers distribution sucessfully. Moreover, we also demonstrated that histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitor TSA significantly prevented injury-induced ASC using this method. Therefore, the present research provides a useful tool to study ASC and PCO biology as well as the efficacy of new therapies.

        "text": "Dirac and Weyl semimetals are 3D analogues of graphene in which crystalline symmetry protects the nodes against gap formation1, 2, 3. Na3Bi and \u200bCd3As2 were predicted to be Dirac semimetals4, 5, and recently confirmed to be so by photoemission experiments6, 7, 8. Several novel transport properties in a magnetic field have been proposed for Dirac semimetals2, 9, 10, 11. Here, we report a property of \u200bCd3As2 that was unpredicted, namely a remarkable protection mechanism that strongly suppresses backscattering in zero magnetic field. In single crystals, the protection results in ultrahigh mobility, 9 × 106 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 5 K. Suppression of backscattering results in a transport lifetime 104 times longer than the quantum lifetime. The lifting of this protection by the applied magnetic field leads to a very large magnetoresistance. We discuss how this may relate to changes to the Fermi surface induced by the applied magnetic field. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Transport measurements in a series of \u200bCd3As2 samples. a, Curves of the resistivity ρ1 versus T measured along the needle axis in five Set A and two Set B samples (semilog scale). In needle-shaped crystals (Set A), ρ1 undergoes a steep decrease below 50 K that is strongly sample dependent. In A5, ρ1 falls by three orders of magnitude to 21 nΩ cm at 5 K. In A4, however, ρ1 has a milder decrease (to 14.6 μΩ cm at 5 K). By contrast, the multidomain samples B1 and B7 do not exhibit the steep decrease below 50 K. b, Anisotropy γ ≡ ρ2/ρ1 at 5 K, which is large (20\u201330) in A1 and A5, but modest for A4 (2.7). The inset is a sketch of the energy dispersion E(k) near the Dirac nodes (adapted from ref. 20). c, Hall conductivity σxy versus B in A4, A5, A6 and A8 (B = μ0H, with μ0 the vacuum permeability). The peak locates the geometric-mean mobility . For clarity, the region encircled by the red circle is shown expanded in the inset. d, Measured mobility μm (solid triangles) and x-axis mobility (solid circles) versus the zero-H conductivity σ10 for A4, A5, A6 and A8. The error bars are standard errors of the mean. Figure 2: Conversion of the resistivity matrix ρij to the conductivity matrix σij. a, Resistivity ρxx for Sample A4, exhibiting an unusual H-linear profile, and Hall resistivity ρyx (n-type in sign), showing a slight anomaly in weak H (measured at 5 K with and current ; B = μ0H). b, Inferred conductivity σxx(H) and Hall conductivity σxy(H) for Sample A4. The sharp extrema in σxy at ±0.42 T locate the geometric-mean mobility . c, ρxx and ρyx at 5 K in Sample A5. d, Corresponding curves of σij(H) for Sample A5. The peaks in σxy now occur at ±5.0 mT, reflecting the much higher μm in A5 (by a factor of 85). In A5, the MR is also larger, but becomes H2 at large fields. Curves for samples A6 and A8 are shown in the Supplementary Information. Typical dimensions of the crystals are 1.5 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm3 (see Supplementary Table 1 for exact dimensions). Figure 3: Magnetoresistance curves ρxx(H, θ) and SdH oscillations in tilted H in \u200bCd3As2 at 2.5 K in Samples A1 and B7. a, MR curves for the high-mobility single crystal A1 plotted for 0 < θ < 90°. The log\u2013log plot in the inset shows that, at 2 T, ρxx(H)/ρ0 changes from an H-linear increase to an anomalous power law H2.55, reaching a value of 1,600 at 15 T (θ = 90°). SdH oscillations are resolved at all θ. b, In weak H the MR is nearly H-linear. As θ → 0, the MR rapidly decreases (at fixed H). It acquires a negative contribution for |θ| < 5°. c,d, The multidomain sample B7 exhibits a similar behaviour, except that the striking H-linear dependence persists to 9 T. The tilt angle θ and the x- and z-axes are defined in the inset to b [ [112]]. Figure 4: Shubnikov\u2013de Haas (SdH) oscillations in Samples A1 and B7 at 2.5 K. a, SdH oscillations in ρxx (solid curves), for tilt angles θ = 6°, 9° and 12°. Fits to the Lifshitz\u2013Kosevich expression (shown as dotted curves) yield a quantum lifetime τQ ~ 104 × times shorter than τtr. The inset plots the variation of SF(θ) about the average 47.5 T. b, Traces of ρxx versus H as θ is changed in 1° steps through 0° at 2.5 K (Sample B7). The curve at θ = 0 has a distinct, negative MR contribution (shown by the averaged plot ρave). As |θ| increases from 1° to 4°, the giant positive MR term rapidly dominates. Below 0.2 T, the MR is positive and nearly isotropic (see Supplementary Information for more information).

        "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic disruption, and neuronal loss. Several studies have demonstrated decreases of docosahexaenoic acid-containing phosphatidylcholines (DHA-PCs) in the AD brain. In this study, we used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry in postmortem AD brain to show that PC molecular species containing stearate and DHA, namely PC(18:0/22:6), was selectively depleted in the gray matter of patients with AD. Moreover, in the brain regions with marked amyloid β (Aβ) deposition, the magnitude of the PC(18:0/22:6) reduction significantly correlated with disease duration. Furthermore, at the molecular level, this depletion was associated with reduced levels of the postsynaptic protein PSD-95 but not the presynaptic protein synaptophysin. Interestingly, this reduction in PC(18:0/22:6) levels did not correlate with the degrees of Aβ deposition and neuronal loss in AD. The analysis of the correlations of key factors and disease duration showed that their effects on the disease time course were arranged in order as Aβ deposition, presynaptic disruption, postsynaptic disruption coupled with PC(18:0/22:6) reduction, and neuronal loss.

A PC(18:0/22:6) reduction parallels postsynaptic disruption when plotted against disease duration, but it does not parallel Aβ deposition, neuronal loss, and presynaptic disruption. It is generally accepted that Aβ deposition becomes abnormal early and before the appearance of clinical symptom, and the abnormal brain morphology resulting from neuronal loss happens late relative to neuronal dysfunction31. Because the loss of synaptophysin was not correlated with the disease durations of the patients in this study, presynaptic disruption may occur earlier than postsynaptic disruption.

We confirm a transitional change in the character of the pair coherence, between local and nonlocal, in the same device as the effective length-to-width ratio of the device was modulated by tuning the pair-coherence length ξT in the graphene layer.

        "text": "The two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interface between insulating LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 is intriguing both as a fundamental science topic and for possible applications in electronics or sensors. For example, because the electrical conductance of the 2DEG at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface can be tuned by applying an electric field, new electronic devices utilizing the 2DEG at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface could be possible. For the implementation of field-effect devices utilizing the 2DEG, determining the on/off switching voltage for the devices and ensuring their stability are essential. However, the factors influencing the threshold voltage have not been extensively investigated. Here, we report the voltage-induced shift of the threshold voltage of Pt/LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures. A large negative voltage induces an irreversible positive shift in the threshold voltage. In fact, after the application of such a large negative voltage, the original threshold voltage cannot be recovered even by application of a large positive electric field. This irreversibility is attributed to the generation of deep traps near the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface under the negative voltage. This finding could contribute to the implementation of nanoelectronic devices using the 2DEG at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface.

We report layered potassium niobate (K4Nb6O17) nanolamina as adsorbent to remove toxic Sr2+, Ba2+ and Cs+ cations from wastewater. The results show that K4Nb6O17 nanolamina can permanently confine the toxic cations within the interlayer spacing via a considerable deformation of the metastable layered structure during the ion exchange process. At the same time, the nanolaminar adsorbent exhibits prompt adsorption kinetics, high adsorption capacity and selectivity, and superior acid resistance. These merits make it be a promising material as ion exchanger for the removal of radioactive cations from wastewater.

        "text": "Dissipative two-level systems (TLS) have been a long-standing problem in glassy solids over the last fifty years, and have recently gained new relevance as sources of decoherence in quantum computing. Resonant absorption by TLSs in the dielectric poses a serious limitation to the performance of superconducting qubits; however, the microscopic nature of these systems has yet to be established. Based on first-principles calculations, we propose that hydrogen impurities in Al2O3 are the main source of TLS resonant absorption. Hydrogen is an ubiquitous impurity and can easily incorporate in Al2O3. We find that interstitial H in Al2O3 forms a hydrogen bond (O-H\u2026O). At specific O-O distances, consistent with bond lengths found in amorphous Al2O3 or near Al2O3 surfaces or interfaces, the H atom feels a double well. Tunneling between two symmetric positions gives rise to resonant absorption in the range of 10 GHz, explaining the experimental observations. We also calculate the expected qubit-TLS coupling and find it to lie between 16 and 20 MHz, consistent with experimental measurements.

Known mechanisms involve either chemical or hydrodynamic instabilities in unconfined electrolytes. Here, it is shown that over-limiting current can be sustained by surface conduction in nanopores, without any such instabilities, and used to control dendritic growth during electrodeposition. Copper electrodeposits are grown in anodized aluminum oxide membranes with polyelectrolyte coatings to modify the surface charge. At low currents, uniform electroplating occurs, unaffected by surface modification due to thin electric double layers, but the morphology changes dramatically above the limiting current. With negative surface charge, growth is enhanced along the nanopore surfaces, forming surface dendrites and nanotubes behind a deionization shock. With positive surface charge, dendrites avoid the surfaces and are either guided along the nanopore centers or blocked from penetrating the membrane.

        "text": "Identifying the nature of magnetism, itinerant or localized, remains a major challenge in condensed-matter science. Purely localized moments appear only in magnetic insulators, whereas itinerant moments more or less co-exist with localized moments in metallic compounds such as the doped-cuprate or the iron-based superconductors, hampering a thorough understanding of the role of magnetism in phenomena like superconductivity or magnetoresistance. Here we distinguish two antiferromagnetic modulations with respective propagation wave vectors at Q± = (H ± 0.557(1), 0, L ± 0.150(1)) and QC = (H ± 0.564(1), 0, L), where (H, L) are allowed Miller indices, in an ErPd2Si2 single crystal by neutron scattering and establish their respective temperature- and field-dependent phase diagrams. The modulations can co-exist but also compete depending on temperature or applied field strength. They couple differently with the underlying lattice albeit with associated moments in a common direction. The Q± modulation may be attributed to localized 4f moments while the QC correlates well with itinerant conduction bands, supported by our transport studies. Hence, ErPd2Si2 represents a new model compound that displays clearly-separated itinerant and localized moments, substantiating early theoretical predictions and providing a unique platform allowing the study of itinerant electron behavior in a localized antiferromagnetic matrix.

The phase diagram clearly shows three regimes. We attribute regime I to the AFM state from purely localized 4f moments; regime II to a mixture of localized 4f moments with a SDW from weakly-pinned collective spins in the valence bands (details in the text); and regime III to large amplitude short-ranged spin orders. The error bars are from Lorentzian fits. Full size image View in article Figure 5: Magnetic-field dependent phase diagram of the two spin states at 3 K.

(b) L-scans around (Hmax, 0, 0) with Hmax taken from (a) at selected fields clearly showing that with increasing field, the central peak corresponding to the SDW state weakens largely and almost vanishes into the background above ~0.18 T. (c) H-scans around (H, 0, 0) at selected fields clearly showing that with decreasing field, the H-center keeps almost unchanged. (d) L-scans around (Hmax, 0, 0) at selected fields clearly showing that while decreasing the field to 0 T, the central peak corresponding to the SDW state does not come back as shown in (b). These interesting field- and temperature-dependent behaviors indicate that the itinerant SDW state, unlike that of the conventional long-ranged AFM ordering (a magnetic domain), is much more delicate consistent with the previous Mössbauer study [50]. The solid lines in (a\u2013d) are Lorentzian fits, and error bars are statistical errors. For clarity, the intensities in (b\u2013d) are vertically shifted. Full size image View in article Figure 7: Temperature variation of the resistance as measured at zero field. With dc current I parallel to the axis (up) and along the zone (down). We note that the threshold of magnetic field for weakening the SDW state is so small (Fig. 5) that the commercial PPMS is unable to detect the potential weak magnetoresistance effect. The SDW state observed here represents more or less a new type of spin state since its threshold field is extremely small. Therefore, we propose that ErPd2Si2 is a SDW conductor.

        "text": "Defects are almost inevitable during the fabrication process, and their existence strongly affects thermodynamic and (opto)electronic properties of two-dimensional materials. Very recent experiments have provided clear evidence for the presence of larger multi-vacancies in silicene, but their structure, stability, and formation mechanism remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a detailed theoretical study of silicene monolayer containing three types of defects: vacancy clusters, extended line defects (ELDs), and di-adatoms. First-principles calculations, along with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, revealed the coalescence tendency of small defects and formation of highly stable vacancy clusters. The 5|8|5 ELD \u2013 the most favorable extended defect in both graphene and silicene sheets \u2013 is found to be easier to form in the latter case due to the mixed sp2/sp3 hybridization of silicon. In addition, hybrid functional calculations that contain part of the Hatree-Fock exchange energy demonstrated that the introduction of single and double silicon adatoms significantly enhances the stability of the system, and provides an effective approach on tuning the magnetic moment and band gap of silicene.

        "text": "The high optical and chemical activity of nanoparticles (NPs) signifies the possibility of converting the spin angular momenta of photons into structural changes in matter. Here, we demonstrate that illumination of dispersions of racemic \u200bCdTe NPs with right- (left-)handed circularly polarized light (CPL) induces the formation of right- (left-)handed twisted nanoribbons with an enantiomeric excess exceeding 30%, which is ∼10 times higher than that of typical CPL-induced reactions. Linearly polarized light or dark conditions led instead to straight nanoribbons. CPL \u2018templating\u2019 of NP assemblies is based on the enantio-selective photoactivation of chiral NPs and clusters, followed by their photooxidation and self-assembly into nanoribbons with specific helicity as a result of chirality-sensitive interactions between the NPs. The ability of NPs to retain the polarization information of incident photons should open pathways for the synthesis of chiral photonic materials and allow a better understanding of the origins of biomolecular homochirality.

The average valence of Ir is 4.33+ and, therefore, Na3Ir3O8 can be viewed as a doped analogue of the hyper-kagome spin liquid with Ir4+. The transport measurements, combined with the electronic structure calculations, indicate that the ground state of Na3Ir3O8 is a low carrier density semi-metal. We argue that the semi-metallic state is produced by a competition of the molecular orbital splitting of t2g orbitals on Ir3 triangles with strong spin-orbit coupling inherent to heavy Ir ions.

Recently semiconductor/superconductor hybrids have appeared as an important example where the atomic scale uniformity of the interface plays a key role in determining the quality of the induced superconducting gap. Here we present epitaxial growth of semiconductor\u2013metal core\u2013shell nanowires by molecular beam epitaxy, a method that provides a conceptually new route to controlled electrical contacting of nanostructures and the design of devices for specialized applications such as topological and gate-controlled superconducting electronics. Our materials of choice, \u200bInAs/\u200bAl grown with epitaxially matched single-plane interfaces, and alternative semiconductor/metal combinations allowing epitaxial interface matching in nanowires are discussed. We formulate the grain growth kinetics of the metal phase in general terms of continuum parameters and bicrystal symmetries. The method realizes the ultimate limit of uniform interfaces and seems to solve the soft-gap problem in superconducting hybrid structures.

        "text": "Besides its interesting physical properties, graphene as a two-dimensional lattice of carbon atoms promises to realize devices with exceptional electronic properties, where freely suspended graphene without contact to any substrate is the ultimate, truly two-dimensional system. The practical realization of nano-devices from suspended graphene, however, relies heavily on finding a structuring method which is minimally invasive. Here, we report on the first electron beam-induced nano-etching of suspended graphene and demonstrate high-resolution etching down to ~7 nm for line-cuts into the monolayer graphene. We investigate the structural quality of the etched graphene layer using two-dimensional (2D) Raman maps and demonstrate its high electronic quality in a nano-device: A 25 nm-wide suspended graphene nanoribbon (GNR) that shows a transport gap with a corresponding energy of ~60 meV. This is an important step towards fast and reliable patterning of suspended graphene for future ballistic transport, nano-electronic and nano-mechanical devices.

        "text": "The p-block semiconductors are regarded as a new family of visible-light photocatalysts because of their dispersive and anisotropic band structures as well as high chemical stability. The bismuth oxide halides belong to this family and have band structures and dispersion relations that can be engineered by modulating the stoichiometry of the halogen elements. Herein, we have developed a new visible-light photocatalyst Bi24O31Cl10 by band engineering, which shows high dye-sensitized photocatalytic activity. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the p-block elements determine the nature of the dispersive electronic structures and narrow band gap in Bi24O31Cl10. Bi24O31Cl10 exhibits excellent visible-light photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of Rhodamine B, which is promoted by dye sensitization due to compatible energy levels and high electronic mobility.

        "text": "Breaking space\u2013time symmetries in two-dimensional crystals can markedly influence their macroscopic electronic properties. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are prime examples where the intrinsically broken crystal inversion symmetry permits the generation of valley-selective electron populations1, 2, 3, 4, even though the two valleys are energetically degenerate, locked by time-reversal symmetry. Lifting the valley degeneracy in these materials is of great interest because it would allow for valley-specific band engineering and offer additional control in valleytronic applications. Although applying a magnetic field should, in principle, accomplish this task, experiments so far have not shown valley-selective energy level shifts in fields accessible in the laboratory. Here, we show the first direct evidence of lifted valley degeneracy in the monolayer TMD \u200bWS2. By applying intense circularly polarized light, which breaks time-reversal symmetry, we demonstrate that the exciton level in each valley can be selectively tuned by as much as 18 meV through the optical Stark effect. These results offer a new way to control the valley degree of freedom, and may provide a means to realize new Floquet topological phases5, 6, 7 in two-dimensional TMDs. At a glance Figures Figure 1: The optical Stark effect and its observation in monolayer \u200bWS2. a, Energy level diagram of two-level |a〉 and |b〉 atoms showing that the equilibrium and Floquet states |a + hv〉 and |b − hv〉 can hybridize, resulting in shifted energy levels. b, Measured absorbance of monolayer \u200bWS2 (black) and a hypothetical absorbance curve (dashed) that simulates the optical Stark effect. c, The simulated change of absorption induced by the pump pulses. d, Schematic of transient absorption spectroscopy set-up (see Methods). e, Time trace of Δα, induced by pump pulses of σ− helicity, measured using probe pulses of the same (σ−, red) and opposite (σ+, black, with offset for clarity) helicities. It shows that the optical Stark effect occurs only during the pump pulse duration (Δt = 0 ps) and when the pump and probe helicities are the same.

The optical Stark effect occurs only between states having the same magnetic quantum numbers. Figure 3: Fluence and detuning dependences of the optical Stark shift. a, Fluence dependence of Δα spectra with fluences up to 120 μJ cm−2 measured with the same pump and probe helicities. b, Fluence and detuning dependences of the SWT with the integration range shown in a. c, SWT plotted as a function of fluence/Δ, showing that all of the data points fall along a common slope (black line). The horizontal error bars correspond to the pump bandwidth of 43 meV at full-width at half-maximum. The fitting slope (black line) and the 95% confidence band (red shading) shows an excellent agreement with the characteristic dependences of the optical Stark shift in equation (2).

        "text": "Thanks to its high electrical conductivity, a graphene plane presents a good shielding efficiency against GHz electromagnetic radiations. Several graphene planes separated by thin polymer spacers add their conductivities arithmetically, because each of them conserves the intrinsic properties of isolated graphene. Maximum absorption of radiations for frequency around 30 GHz is achieved with six separated graphene planes, which is the optimum number. This remarkable result is demonstrated experimentally from electromagnetic measurements performed in the Ka band on a series of multilayers obtained by piling 1, 2, 3 \u2026 graphene/PMMA units on a silica substrate. Theoretical calculations convincingly explain the observed absorption and transmission data in the GHz domain.

        "text": "Dispersion engineering of metamaterials is critical yet not fully released in applications where broadband and multispectral responses are desirable. Here we propose a strategy to circumvent the bandwidth limitation of metamaterials by implementing two-dimensional dispersion engineering in the meta-atoms. Lorentzian resonances are exploited as building blocks in both dimensions of the dedicatedly designed meta-atoms to construct the expected dispersion. We validated this strategy by designing and fabricating an anisotropic metamirror, which can accomplish achromatic polarization transformation in 4-octave bandwidth (two times of previous broadband converters). This work not only paves the way for broadband metamaterials design but also inspire potential applications of dispersion management in nano-photonics.

        "text": "Polyampholyte-coated (poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)-co-3-(diethylamino)-propylamine (DEAPA)) magnetite nanoparticles (PAMNPs) have been prepared as contrasting agent used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Excellent biocompatibility is required for contrasting agents used in high-resolution magnetic resonance angiography. To evaluate the biocompatibility of PAMNPs, some experiments have been conducted. The hemolysis, plasma recalcification, dynamic blood clotting, prothrombin time, inflammatory cytokine release and complement system activation assays were carried out to investigate the hemocompatibility. To evaluate the toxicity to vessel, MTT test and vascular irritation tests were conducted. Tissue toxicity test was also performed to investigate the biocompability in vivo. We also looked into the biodistribution. The results showed that PAMNPs at the working concentration (0.138 mM) present similar hemocompatibility with negative control, thus have no significant effect to vessels. PAMNPs were mainly distributed in the liver and the blood. The circulation time in blood was considerably long, with the half-time of 3.77 h in plasma. This property is advantageous for PAMNPs' use in angiography. PAMNPs could be metabolized rapidly in mice and were not observed to cause any toxic or adverse effect. In short, these results suggest that the PAMNPs have great potential to serve as safe contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

        "text": "The solution viscosity near an interface, which affects the solution behavior and the molecular dynamics in the solution, differs from the bulk. This paper measured the effective viscosity of a dilute poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) solution adjacent to a Au electrode using the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) technique. We evidenced that the effect of an adsorbed PEG layer can be ignored, and calculated the zero shear rate effective viscosity to remove attenuation of high shear frequency oscillations. By increasing the overtone n from 3 to 13, the thickness of the sensed polymer solution decreased from ~70 to 30 nm. The zero shear rate effective viscosity of the polymer solution and longest relaxation time of PEG chains within it decrease with increasing solution thickness. The change trends are independent of the relation between the apparent viscosity and shear frequency and the values of the involved parameter, suggesting that the polymer solution and polymer chains closer to a solid substrate have a greater effective viscosity and slower relaxation mode, respectively. This method can study the effect of an interface presence on behavior and phenomena relating to the effective viscosity of polymer solutions, including the dynamics of discrete polymer chains.

        "text": "Non-reciprocal components, which are essential to many modern communication systems, are almost exclusively based on magneto-optical materials, severely limiting their applicability. A practical and inexpensive route to magnetic-free non-reciprocity could revolutionize radio-frequency and nanophotonic communication networks. Angular-momentum biasing was recently proposed as a means of realizing isolation for sound waves travelling in a rotating medium1, and envisaged as a path towards compact, linear integrated non-reciprocal electromagnetic components2, 3. Inspired by this concept, here we demonstrate a subwavelength, linear radio-frequency non-reciprocal circulator free from magnetic materials and bias. The scheme is based on the parametric modulation of three identical, strongly and symmetrically coupled resonators. Their resonant frequencies are modulated by external signals with the same amplitude and a relative phase difference of 120°, imparting an effective electronic angular momentum to the system. We observe giant non-reciprocity, with up to six orders of magnitude difference in transmission for opposite directions. Furthermore, the device topology is tunable in real time, and can be directly embedded in a conventional integrated circuit. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Magnetic-free non-reciprocity with angular-momentum biasing. a, An azimuthally symmetric ring with spatiotemporal permittivity modulation Δε(ϕ, t) = Δεm cos(ωmt − lmϕ). The modulation imparts an effective electronic spin to the ring, with angular velocity Ωm = ωm/lm, which lifts the degeneracy of counter-propagating resonant states and induces non-reciprocity. Its practical realization typically involves discretizing Δε into N different regions (three in the figure). b, A loop consisting of three strongly coupled identical resonators, whose frequencies are modulated according to ω1(t) = ω0 + δωm cos(ωmt), ω2(t) = ω0 + δωm cos(ωmt + 2π/3) and ω3(t) = ω0 + δωm cos(ωmt + 4π/3). Modulation of the resonance frequencies lifts the degeneracy of the counter-rotating states |± = [1 e±i2π/3 e±i4π/3]T, producing non-reciprocity with 100% modulation efficiency. κ is the coupling coefficient. Figure 2: Circuit implementation of the non-reciprocal coupled-resonator loop at radio frequencies. a, A single resonant circuit of the proposed device: an L\u2013C tank with modulated capacitance. The capacitance is equally distributed at both sides of the inductance to maintain symmetry. Capacitance modulation is achieved with varactor diodes, controlled by a static signal Vd.c. and the modulation signal vm(t). b, A loop formed by three identical resonators coupled through three identical capacitances Cc. The loop is further coupled to three external microstrip lines carrying the external signal. c, Fabricated prototype. The maximum dimension of the structure is 2 cm, corresponding to an electrical size of λ/75 at 200 MHz. Figure 3: Response versus frequency. a, Measured transmission from port 1 to ports 2 and 3 without modulation (Vm = 0 V). The power is equally split to the output ports. b, Measured scattering parameters when Vm = 0.6 V. Incident power to ports 1, 2 and 3 is transmitted to ports 2, 3 and 1, respectively, thus realizing a three-port circulator. c, Simulated response of the loop for the case of b: excellent agreement between theory and experiment is observed. All results correspond to Vd.c. = 1.99 V. Figure 4: Response versus modulation and static voltages. a, Measured and simulated transmission between ports 1 and 2. Transmission is different for opposite propagation directions, indicating non-reciprocity. Maximum contrast is observed for Vm = 0.6 V. The results correspond to Vd.c. = 1.99 V. The differences between the measured and simulated results are not due to experimental uncertainties, which are negligible here, but due to the tolerances in the values of the lumped elements which make the measured and simulated layouts slightly different. b, Isolation (S21/S12) in logarithmic scale for the same biasing conditions as in a. For Vm = 0.6 V, the difference between S12 and S21 is over four orders of magnitude. c, Measured isolation on a logarithmic scale versus frequency for different values of Vd.c.. In all cases, Vm is selected, based on our theory, so that isolation at resonance is maximum.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 Accession codes\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Extended data figures and tables\u2022 Supplementary information Muscle contraction is initiated by the release of calcium (Ca2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm of myocytes through ryanodine receptors (RyRs). RyRs are homotetrameric channels with a molecular mass of more than 2.2 megadaltons that are regulated by several factors, including ions, small molecules and proteins. Numerous mutations in RyRs have been associated with human diseases. The molecular mechanism underlying the complex regulation of RyRs is poorly understood. Using electron cryomicroscopy, here we determine the architecture of rabbit RyR1 at a resolution of 6.1 Å. We show that the cytoplasmic moiety of RyR1 contains two large α-solenoid domains and several smaller domains, with folds suggestive of participation in protein\u2013protein interactions. The transmembrane domain represents a chimaera of voltage-gated sodium and pH-activated ion channels. We identify the calcium-binding EF-hand domain and show that it functions as a conformational switch allosterically gating the channel. Subject terms: Cryoelectron microscopy\u2022 Calcium channels At a glance Figures Figure 1: Architecture of RyR1. a, Cryo-EM density map of RyR1 at an average resolution of 6.1 Å coloured by domains.

Divergent regions are marked by a chessboard-like pattern. The long sequence regions absent in the model are shown in grey. Colour gradients between domains indicate that the sequence has been assigned only approximately in these regions. The largest unassigned stretch coincides with DR1 and is most likely disordered.

Insert in a shows a close-up view of filter regions in RyR1. d, The long inner helices continuing into the cytoplasm are similar to the regulatory helices in the prokaryotic potassium channel KcsA, suggesting that the gate in RyR1 can be similarly regulated by conformational changes in these helices. KcsA is depicted in grey. Figure 3: Calcium-induced conformational changes in RyR1. a, Conformational changes between the closed state (1 mM EGTA) shown in blue and the open state (10 mM Ca2+) shown in red involves global rocking movements of the clamp domain. On the right, protomers of the two states are shown in cartoon representation, on the left, the conformational changes between them are depicted as vector field. The vectors are drawn between Cα atoms and their amplitude is multiplied by a factor of 3 for better visualization. b, Transition from the closed (in grey) to the open (in blue for the membrane domain and in red for the C-terminal domain) state induces conformational changes that result in an 8° rotation of the linker helix and a 2 Å dilation of the gate. c, Transmission of conformational changes from the EF-hand to the gate of the channel. The α-solenoid 1 domain, EF-hand, C-terminal domain and membrane domain are depicted in the closed and open state (coloured as in b). The two structures are aligned by the α-solenoid 1 domain preceding the helices that embed the EF-hand. Rearrangement of helices in the EF-hand upon binding of calcium results in twisting of the last two α-helices of α-solenoid 1. This twist coincides with a rotation of the domain between the EF-hand domain and the membrane shifting helices separating α-solenoid 1 from the membrane surface by ~2 Å parallel to the lipid bilayer relative to the core of the α-solenoid 1 domain. Simultaneously the inner helix bends and dilates the gate. Figure 4: Mechanism of calcium release. a, b, Schematic mechanism of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ gating by RyR1. Dynamics of RyR1 in the absence (a) and presence (b) of cytoplasmic calcium are dominated by thermal motions. Only two states are shown representing a continuum of states in reality. The transition between the states is indicated by the letter T. Binding of Ca2+ ions (pink) to the EF-hand domain (purple) induces conformational changes that are transmitted to the domains underneath the α-solenoid 1 (orange) and the C-terminal domain (red). This alters the \u2018average\u2019 conformation of the protein and increases the probability of gate opening during collective thermal motions of the channel. The upper layer of the structure consists of the regulatory and protein\u2013protein interaction domains (only α-solenoids, repeat 3\u20134 and AB domains are shown). The channel regulation through binding of accessory or regulatory proteins to these domains or their chemical modification through post-translational modifications alters the properties of thermal fluctuations and hence allosterically modifies the times and probability of opening of the RyR1 gate. The colour coding of domains is similar to Fig. 1.

Thon rings are visible up to a resolution of 5 Å (b) and 10 Å (g). c, h, Representative two-dimensional class averages calculated in SPARX (c) and RELION (h) show characteristic views of RyR1. d, i, FSC curves between two independently refined half data sets (gold standard) shown for a set of all particles (solid black) and different conformational states (coloured curves). FSC between the volume calculated from all particles and the molecular model of RyR1 are shown as dotted black curves. FSC levels of 0.143 and 0.5 corresponding to the resolution cut off for density maps and the model are indicated. According to the 0.5 criterion the resolution of the model is 8.0 and 9.0 Å for the RyR1 reconstructions of closed and open states. The resolution is slightly lower than that of the map because of incompleteness of the model (the polyalanine model accounts for only about half of all the atoms of RyR1). e, j, Three-dimensional map of RyR1 coloured according to the local resolution calculated in ResMap from two unmasked volumes calculated from independently refined halves of the data sets. The resolution of the electron micoscropy map is heterogeneous with the highest resolution close to the centre of the molecule and the lowest resolution at the periphery. k, Statistics of single particle data. Extended Data Fig. 2: Consensus secondary structure prediction for rabbit RyR1 generated in SABLE. Extension of domains is indicated by rectangles colour-coded as in Fig. 1. Except for the N-terminal AB domain and the three SPRY domains located in the first 1,650 residues, RyR1 is predicted to fold mainly in α-helices connected with coiled structures. The 165 amino acid sequence between residues 4,375 and 4,540, connecting the amphipathic region with the transmembrane domain, is glycine- and proline-rich and predicted to be disordered. Extended Data Fig. 3: Positions of transmembrane helices. a, The probability for the formation of transmembrane helices calculated by the program TMHMM is shown for the C-terminal region of RyR1. Red bars indicate α-helices predicted in SABLE. The consensus transmembrane (TM) helices are unambiguously recognized and clearly separated, except of TM3 and TM4, which have nearly no solvent exposed loop in between. The amphipathic and pore helices are also clearly indicated, but have lower hydrophobicity scores than the transmembrane helices. b, Experimental mapping and prediction of transmembrane helices. Sequence ranges of computationally predicted, annotated and experimentally mapped transmembrane helices. Consensus helices between experimental mapping and computational prediction are indicated in bold. Although computational methods suggest just one TM3 helix instead of TM3/4, the width of the hydrophobic region corresponding to helix TM3 is consistent with the presence of two joint transmembrane helices as observed in the topology mapping experiments14. Extended Data Fig. 4: Cross-links identified within RyR1. a, b, Graphical representation (a) and table (b) summarizing cross-links identified in cross-linking mass spectrometry experiments. a, Schematic representation of RyR1 domains colour-coded similar to domains in Fig. 1. The repeat 3\u20134 and EF-hand domains are shown as inserts into the α-solenoid 1.1 and α-solenoid 1.2 domains, respectively. The cross-links are shown by red lines. The approximate length of linkers joining domains is indicated by \u2018Δ\u2019 followed by the number of residues. Disordered regions of linking fragments are shown as fat dotted lines and their positions in the amino acid sequence are indicated. Domains containing β-sheets are depicted as circles, α-helical domains are shown as squares. b, Cross-linked residues are shown with ID score and their distances in the built model (see Supplementary Table 1 for complete list of identified cross-links). Extended Data Fig. 5: Cryo-EM density map of RyR1 at 6.1 Å resolution. a\u2013f, Backbone of the model in ribbon representation coloured as in Fig. 1 and cryo-EM density map from different regions of the structure are shown. a, Transmembrane region showing the inner helix and the helices of the voltage-sensor-like domain. The cytoplasmic part of the inner helix (in red) is resolved as good as the transmembrane helices indicating that the resolution inside the lipid nanodisc is similar to the nearby cytoplasmic regions. b, Pore helix and pore loops showing the absence of the second pore helix found in structurally homologous Nav channels. c, d, Helices of α-solenoid domains 1 (c) and 2 (d). e, Fit of the SPRY2 domain in the density. f, One of the least resolved domains, repeat 1\u20132, rod-shaped densities corresponding to α-helices are visible. g, Structure and density maps of individual domains. Segments of the 6.1 Å RyR1 density map corresponding to individual domains of RyR1 are shown together with the ribbon models of the domains in rainbow colouring from the N terminus (blue) to the C terminus (red). The excellent fitting of the crystallographic model of the N-terminal AB domain (residues 12\u2013532)11 into the density, even revealing conformation of loops that were disordered in the crystal structure, indicates the high quality of our electron microscopy map. The density segment for FKBP bound to RyR1 was extracted from the 8.5 Å cryo-EM map of RyR1 in its open state. Extended Data Fig. 6: Details of the RyR1 structure. a, The α-helical protrusion in α-solenoid 1 (contoured) includes an 80-Å-long α-helix and a bundle of helices exposed to solvent and represents a potential CaM-binding site. b, The phosphorylation loop (shown schematically since it was not resolved in the crystal structure) of repeat 3\u20134 (shown in rainbow colouring from N to C terminus) is exposed to solvent. Mutations of seven residues (four of which are shown as blue spheres) close to the potential phosphorylation site cause human diseases suggesting functional importance of this region and its potential involvement in the interaction with Cav1.1 channels. c, FKBP (red) bound to RyR1 resolved in the cryo-EM map of RyR1 in presence of 10 mM Ca2+. It interacts with the SPRY2 and the α-solenoid 1 domains. d, e, Comparison of the backbone of the RyR1 (coloured in red, yellow, green and blue) membrane domain with the TRPV1 channel (grey). Views perpendicular to (d) and parallel to (e) the membrane plane are shown. The tilt of transmembrane helices in the voltage-sensor domain (S1\u2013S4) is different between the two proteins, while positions of inner helices (S6) in the gate region and architecture of the pore region shown as insert in e are similar. Extended Data Fig. 7: Conserved architecture of RyR and IP3R channels. a, Conserved core between RyRs and IP3Rs. The evolutionarily most conserved and likely functionally important core includes part of the AB domain bridging the C-terminal regions of the α-solenoid 1 (blue), the C terminus of α-solenoid 1 (orange), which is in direct contact with the C-terminal domain (red). To indicate better the extent of the C-terminal domain the corresponding density segments are shown. The helices of the membrane domain are shown in dark blue. In the side view the density of the nanodisc is shown in light grey. The colour coding is identical to Fig. 1. b, c Fit of RyR1 domains in the IP3R1 density map. b, Rigid body fit of the RyR1 domains conserved between IP3Rs and RyRs into the 17 Å resolution cryo-EM density map of IP3R1 (ref. 34) shows a high correlation coefficient of 0.90. c, Positions of the individual domains in RyR1 (grey) compared to their positions in IP3R1 (coloured). The colour coding is the same as in Fig. 1. Although the middle part of the α-solenoid 1 domain is not conserved, the secondary structure prediction of this region in IP3R1 is similar to RyR1 containing mainly α-helices. We therefore included it in the fit and it agrees well with the density. The complete transmembrane region was included in the fit as the architecture of the ion-channel domain is extremely conserved even between more distant channels. With the exception of RIH2 (2155\u20132477), which shifted by ~70 Å (this domain for RyR1 corresponds to the α-solenoid 2 domain and is omitted from the figure), all other domains had only minor shifts. The large shift of RIH might be caused by the actual shift that occurred as α-solenoid 2 evolved or by reverse directionality of the solenoid domain (Supplementary Information). d, Conserved sequence regions between RyR1 and IP3R1. Numbering corresponds to rabbit RyR1 and human IP3R1, respectively. The most conserved regions are highlighted in bold. Extended Data Fig. 8: Sequence conservation between RyRs and IP3Rs. a, b, The most conserved regions between RyRs and IP3Rs are in the N-terminal (a, residues 1\u2013432 rabbit RyR1) and C-terminal (b, residues 3,796\u20135,037 rabbit RyR1) sequence regions. Amino acid sequences were aligned in CLUSTALW2, the amino acids with conservation >50% were coloured in clustalw colour scheme. Domains with the highest conservation are indicated with black bars. Aligned sequences from top to bottom are: rabbit RyR1, human RyR1, rabbit RyR2, human RyR2, rabbit RyR3, human RyR3, Oikopleura dioica RyR, Caenorhabditis elegans RyR, Drosophila melanogaster RyR, Drosophila melanogaster IP3R and human IP3R1, 2 and 3. Extended Data Fig. 9: Conformational dynamics of RyR1 in closed and open states. a\u2013c, Collective motions, changes in the gate region and relative domain movements between different conformations in the closed (a) and open (b, c) states. Left panels: on the right, protomers of the respective two states are shown in cartoon representation, on the left, the conformational changes between them are depicted as vector field. Second panel from left: top view on the pore region depicting the S4\u2013S5 linker and the inner pore helices. Third panel form left: membrane domain, C-terminal domain, α-solenoid 1, and EF-hand of two different conformations in solid-cylinder representation. As in Fig. 3c the structures were aligned to the core of the α-solenoid 1 domain preceding the helices that embed the EF-hand. Similarities between the structures point towards an absence of the specific conformational changes between the conformers from the same data set. Right panels show densities of RyR1 dimers corresponding to different conformations with fitted RyR1 models. Tables Extended Data Table 1: Structural domains of RyR1 Videos Video 1: Conformational changes between open and closed states The video shows morphs of cryo-EM maps and structures of RyR1 between closed and open states of the channel. First an overview of conformational changes is shown for a dimer. Then the video zooms on conformational changes at the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane where the ion gate is formed by a bundle of four inner helices (the structure is coloured similar to Figure 1) and conformational changes around EF-hand (purple). To better visualize conformational changes around the EF-hand the density maps and structures of a fragment of a RyR1 protomer were aligned to the α-solenoid 1 region preceding the EF-hand (orange, left from the EF-hand), see also Figure 3. Video 2: Multiple conformations of RyR1 in closed and open states Morphs of cryo-EM density maps between two extreme conformations of RyR1 in the closed state and between two conformational transition modes identified in the open state.

        "text": "In gene therapy, how genetic therapeutics can be efficiently and safely delivered into target tissues/cells remains a major obstacle to overcome. To address this issue, nanoparticles consisting of non-covalently coupled polyethyleneimine (PEI) and folic acid (FA) to the magnetic and fluorescent core/shell of Fe3O4@SiO2(FITC) was tested for their ability to deliver Notch-1 shRNA. Our results showed that Fe3O4@SiO2(FITC)/PEI-FA/Notch-1 shRNA nanoparticles are 64 nm in diameter with well dispersed and superparamagnetic. These nanoparticles with on significant cytotoxicity are capable of delivering Notch-1 shRNA into human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells with high efficiency while effectively protected shRNA from degradation by exogenous DNaseI and nucleases. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and fluorescence microscopy showed significant preferential uptake of Fe3O4@SiO2(FITC)/PEI-FA/Notch-1 shRNA nanocomplex by MDA-MB-231 cells. Transfected MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited significantly decreased expression of Notch-1, inhibited cell proliferation, and increased cell apoptosis, leading to the killing of MDA-MB-231 cells. In light of the magnetic targeting capabilities of Fe3O4@SiO2(FITC)/PEI-FA, our results show that by complexing with a second molecular targeting therapeutic, such as Notch-1 shRNA in this report, Fe3O4@SiO2(FITC)/PEI-FA can be exploited as a novel, non-viral, and concurrent targeting delivery system for targeted gene therapy as well as for MR imaging in cancer diagnosis.

        "text": "Hydrogen in the Earth's deep interior has been thought to exist as a hydroxyl group in high-pressure minerals. We present Muon Spin Rotation experiments on SiO2 stishovite, which is an archetypal high-pressure mineral. Positive muon (which can be considered as a light isotope of proton) implanted in stishovite was found to capture electron to form muonium (corresponding to neutral hydrogen). The hyperfine-coupling parameter and the relaxation rate of spin polarization of muonium in stishovite were measured to be very large, suggesting that muonium is squeezed in small and anisotropic interstitial voids without binding to silicon or oxygen. These results imply that hydrogen may also exist in the form of neutral atomic hydrogen in the deep mantle.

        "text": "Hypervariable loops of HIV-1 Env protein gp120 are speculated to play roles in the conformational transition of Env to the receptor binding-induced metastable state. Structural analysis of full-length Env-based immunogens, containing the entire V2 loop, displayed tighter association between gp120 subunits, resulting in a smaller trimeric diameter than constructs lacking V2. A prominent basal quaternary location of V2 and V3\u2032 that challenges previous reports would facilitate gp41-independent gp120-gp120 interactions and suggests a quaternary mechanism of epitope occlusion facilitated by hypervariable loops. Deletion of V2 resulted in dramatic exposure of basal, membrane-proximal gp41 epitopes, consistent with its predicted basal location. The structural features of HIV-1 Env characterized here provide grounds for a paradigm shift in loop exposure and epitope occlusion, while providing substantive rationale for epitope display required for elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies, as well as substantiating previous pertinent literature disregarded in recent reports.

Full size image View in article Figure 2: Structure of gp140-PG16 complex reveals basal V2 location, and deletion of V2 results in exposure of basal gp41 epitopes as detected by western blot and ELISA. (A) The gp140 trimer was incubated with PG16 Fab and imaged by cryoEM. Structure of the gp140-PG16 complex reveals a basal density emanating from the putative location of the V2 loop (red). Resolution is ~26 Å at 0.5 FSC. (B) Superimposition of the gp140 unliganded map (solid) and the gp140-PG16 complex (mesh) reveals that binding of PG16 occurs at the basal V2 density (red mesh). (C) Western blot of gp140 and gp140ΔV2 constructs labeled with antibodies 50\u201369 and 2F5, targeting apical and basal gp41 epitopes respectively, shows that exposure of the 50\u201369 epitope (targeting the intrahelical disulfide-containing loop on gp41) is unaffected by V2 deletion, while 2F5 epitope exposure (targeting the gp41 membrane-proximal external region) is greatly enhanced after V2 deletion. Blots shown are representative results. (D) ELISA of gp140 and gp140ΔV2 bound to 50\u201369 and 2F5 similarly reveal that while 50\u201369 epitope exposure is unaffected by V2 deletion, 2F5 epitope exposure is significantly enhanced by V2 deletion (n = 3). Full size image View in article Figure 3: Comparison of gp120-gp41 contacts and inner-outer domain separation in full length gp140 and gp140ΔV2. (A) 2D analysis of gp140 and gp140-CD4m class averages by cursor profile reveals distinct weakening of gp120-gp41 interface region, as exemplified by graph at bottom (arrow). The cursor profiles were measured from the center of the trimer outwards to the edge of the circular mask. Oblique views of unbound gp140 (top) and CD4m-bound gp140 (bottom) reveal trimeric flattening and subunit rotations elicited by ligand binding. Scale bar = 50 nm. Resolution of gp140-CD4m structure is ~26 Å at 0.5 FSC. (B) Top: Density map of gp140 shows a strong interface between gp120 and gp41. Bottom: Density map of gp140-CD4m complex shows largely diminished gp120-gp41 interface. (C) Slice through gp140 structure (top) shows a density separation, likely representing the inner and outer gp120 domains, while slicing through gp140-CD4m (bottom) shows a collapse of domains, without discernible gap between inner and outer domain. Full size image View in article Figure 4: Schematic representation of gp140 demonstrates intersubunit associations, relaxation of trimeric diameter upon deletion of V2. (A) The gp140 trimer was compared with the gp140ΔV2, gp140-CD4m and gp140ΔV2-CD4m maps. The degree of gp120-gp41 interface strength appears to decrease as a function of both V2 deletion and CD4m conjugation, with the gp140ΔV2-CD4m map representing the most \u201copen\u201d state. Inclusion of the V2 loop also results in a smaller trimeric diameter (100 Å), though the diameter remains unchanged in the gp140ΔV2, gp140-CD4m and gp140ΔV2-CD4m maps (110 Å). (B) 2D comparison of gp140ΔV2TV1 with full length constructs gp140TV1, gp140DU156.1, gp140CAP239 and gp140CAP45 reveals that full length constructs all had smaller trimeric diameters (99\u2013103 Å) than gp140ΔV2TV1 (110 Å), indicative of closer intersubunit associations in full-length constructs than in ΔV2 constructs. Scale bar = 75 Å. Full size image View in article Figure 5: Docking of coordinates into gp140 and gp140-CD4m density maps and location of epitopes, and 2D segmentation of unbound gp140 map. (A) Side view of gp140 structure with SIV unliganded gp120 X-ray coordinates (PDB: 2BF1) docked. V1/V2 stem is in magenta, CD4 binding site is red, and V4 loop is green. Arrows point to potential N-linked glycosylation sites on V4 near the trimer apex. Solid surface represents predominant density, with weaker density shown in mesh. Scale bar = 50 Å. Dashed rectangle outlines detail shown in (C). (B) Likely binding orientation of CD4 (yellow) to gp140. Note the restricted accessibility to the CD4BS conferred by density near the threefold, attributed to heavy glycosylation in the V4 region. Arrows are shown in same orientation as in (A). (C) Juxtaposition of the truncated V1/V2 loop stem with the bifurcated density proximal to the viral membrane confirms our earlier V2 location. Arrow points to V1/V2 stem, as V1/V2 was truncated from the coordinates. (D) 2D segmentation of unbound gp140 map at low gradient magnitudes (mesh) and high gradient magnitudes (solid), from a top view, reveals that the variable loop regions at the base of the trimer disappear when map is visualized at high gradient intensities, suggesting that these regions are structurally malleable and not rigid. Core of the protein at the center is evident at high gradient magnitudes, suggesting that there is little change in voxel intensity rate of change defining the core of the structure, as opposed to the variable loops. At right, the proximity of the basal V2 (red) and apical V3 (green) promote intersubunit contacts, decreasing trimeric diameter in the unliganded state. (E) Model of quaternary effects of V2 deletion and CD4m binding. At left, the full length trimer shows a robust gp120-gp41 interface and interprotomer interactions between V2 and V3\u2032 loops. The gp120-gp41 interface is partly diminished following V2 deletion, while interprotomer contacts are abrogated, resulting in a relaxed trimer with a larger diameter. Binding of CD4/CD4m results in further weakening of the gp120-gp41 interface, subunit rotation (as exemplified by the rotated CD4BS), and enhanced exposure of the V3 loop.

Ferromagnetic manganites have been seen as a good candidate, and aside from a small minority-spin pocket observed in La2−2xSr1+2xMn2O7 (x = 0.38), transport measurements show that ferromagnetic manganites essentially behave like half metals. Here we develop robust tight-binding models to describe the electronic band structure of the majority as well as minority spin states of ferromagnetic, spin-canted antiferromagnetic, and fully antiferromagnetic bilayer manganites. Both the bilayer coupling between the MnO2 planes and the mixing of the |x2 − y2 > and |3z2 − r2 > Mn 3d orbitals play an important role in the subtle behavior of the bilayer splitting.

        "text": "Topological excitations keep fascinating physicists since many decades. While individual vortices and solitons emerge and have been observed in many areas of physics, their most intriguing higher dimensional topological relatives, skyrmions (smooth, topologically stable textures) and magnetic monopoles emerging almost necessarily in any grand unified theory and responsible for charge quantization remained mostly elusive. Here we propose that loading a three-component nematic superfluid such as 23Na into a deep optical lattice and thereby creating an insulating core, one can create topologically stable skyrmion textures. The skyrmion's extreme stability and its compact geometry enable one to investigate the skyrmion's structure, and the interplay of topology and excitations in detail. In particular, the superfluid's excitation spectrum as well as the quantum numbers are demonstrated to change dramatically due to the skyrmion, and reflect the presence of a trapped monopole, as imposed by the skyrmion's topology. Subject terms: Quantum fluids and solids\u2022 Ultracold gases At a glance Figures View all figures Figure 1: Schematic structure of the Mott skyrmion. (a) A Mott insulator (MI) core is surrounded by a superfluid (SF) shell with a skyrmion spin structure. Arrows denote the orientation of the nematic order parameter, in equation (1). The MI core stabilizes the skyrmion by keeping it from drifting out from the trap. (b) Schematic finite temperature phase diagram of strongly interacting bosons in an optical lattice. The red arrow shows the chemical potential as one moves from the center of the trapped skyrmion towards its edge. The MI has no magnetic structure at the temperatures considered.

(c,d) show in-trap particle densities. SF order of one of the spin components leads to a local increase of the component's particle density at the expense of those of the other two components, leading to a specific density structure characterizing the skyrmion (bottom). This structure gets significantly more pronounced at lower temperatures. [Physical parameters of the plot: T/U0 = 0.05, U2/U0 = 0.025, zJ/U0 = 0.18, chemical potential in the middle µmid/U0 = 0.36, and at the edge µedge/U0 = −0.09.]. Full size image View in article Figure 3: Excitation spectrum. The left (right) panel visualizes the low energy part of the excitation spectrum above the trivial (skyrmion) ground states in units of ω2 = 1/(mRξ2), with the magnetic healing length . Due to the rotational symmetry of the trivial state around , each excited state has a 2-fold spin degeneracy in addition to the (2l + 1)-fold orbital degeneracy. In contrast, spin degeneracy splits, and only orbital (rotational) degeneracies survive in the skyrmion sector. The trivial and skyrmion states exhibit different number of zero modes (Goldstone modes) as well. Apart from the phase degree of freedom, only two zero modes exist in the trivial case, since rotations around in configuration space leave this state invariant. In the skyrmion state, however, the number of zero modes increases by one, since rotations around all three spin axes provide a zero mode on top of the phase mode.

        "text": "Two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) atomic layers have a strong potential to be used as 2D electronic sensor components. However, intrinsic synthesis challenges have made this task difficult. In addition, the detection mechanisms for gas molecules are not fully understood. Here, we report a high-performance gas sensor constructed using atomic-layered MoS2 synthesised by chemical vapour deposition (CVD). A highly sensitive and selective gas sensor based on the CVD-synthesised MoS2 was developed. In situ photoluminescence characterisation revealed the charge transfer mechanism between the gas molecules and MoS2, which was validated by theoretical calculations. First-principles density functional theory calculations indicated that NO2 and NH3 molecules have negative adsorption energies (i.e., the adsorption processes are exothermic). Thus, NO2 and NH3 molecules are likely to adsorb onto the surface of the MoS2. The in situ PL characterisation of the changes in the peaks corresponding to charged trions and neutral excitons via gas adsorption processes was used to elucidate the mechanisms of charge transfer between the MoS2 and the gas molecules.

        "text": "The interaction between light and magnetism is considered a promising route to the development of energy-efficient data storage technologies. To date, however, ultrafast optical magnetization control has been limited to a binary process, whereby light in either of two polarization states generates (writes) or adopts (reads) a magnetic bit carrying either a positive or negative magnetization. Here, we report how the fundamental limitation of just two states can be overcome, allowing an arbitrary optical polarization state to be written magnetically. The effect is demonstrated using a three-sublattice antiferromagnet\u2014hexagonal YMnO3. Its three magnetic oscillation eigenmodes are selectively excited by the three polarization eigenstates of the light. The magnetic oscillation state is then transferred back into the polarization state of an optical probe pulse, thus completing an arbitrary optomagnonic write\u2013read cycle.

A probe pulse component S\u2032i is modified by a magnetic oscillation along the j-axis (resulting from a pump pulse component Sj) by an oscillation ΔS\u2032k with ijk according to the Levi\u2013Civita tensor εijk.

        "text": "Graphene's isolation launched explorations of fundamental relativistic physics originating from the planar honeycomb lattice arrangement of the carbon atoms, and of potential technological applications in nanoscale electronics. Bottom-up fabricated atomically-precise segmented graphene nanoribbons, SGNRs, open avenues for studies of electrical transport, coherence, and interference effects in metallic, semiconducting, and mixed GNRs, with different edge terminations. Conceptual and practical understanding of electric transport through SGNRs is gained through nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) conductance calculations and a Dirac continuum model that absorbs the valence-to-conductance energy gaps as position-dependent masses, including topological-in-origin mass-barriers at the contacts between segments. The continuum model reproduces the NEGF results, including optical Dirac Fabry-Prot (FP) equidistant oscillations for massless relativistic carriers in metallic armchair SGNRs, and an unequally-spaced FP pattern for mixed armchair-zigzag SGNRs where carriers transit from a relativistic (armchair) to a nonrelativistic (zigzag) regime. This provides a unifying framework for analysis of coherent transport phenomena and interpretation of forthcoming experiments in SGNRs.

The first two columns (employing red colors) display TB-NEGF results. The third column (employing green colors) displays continuum DFP results, which reproduce the TB-NEGF results in the middle column. (IIII) Schematics of the nanoribbons employed in the TB-NEGF calculations. A 3-segment segmented GNR is denoted as , with being the number of carbon atoms specifying the width of the ribbon segments. In all configurations, the semi-infinite leads are shown in blue color on the far left and far right. Note the steps nG0 in (a) reflecting full conductance quantization for the uniform nanoribbon. Instead of steps, the SaGNR junctions in (bf) exhibit Fabry-Prot-type conductance oscillations whose maxima are the places where conductance quantization is maintained. The effect of the relative widths of the leads and the constriction on the conductance of the all-metallic junctions is shown in (c,e) (TB-NEGF) and in (d,f) (corresponding DFP, respectively), illustrating Fabry-Prot oscillations (c,d) for a constriction width close to that of the leads see schematic (II) and the development of a sharper oscillatory pattern conductance spikes, see (e) and (f) for a junction with much wider leads see (III). The DFP approach is used to analyze the behavior of the TB-NEGF conductance in the energy range of the 1G0 step see (b). (IV) Diagram of the double mass-barrier used in the DFP method case of massless Dirac-Weyl electrons with m1 = 0 and , being the carrier mass in the leads (not shown). The double-barrier parameters that reproduce the TB-NEGF results were L1 = 58a0, L2 = 1a0, for (d) and L1 = 60a0, L2 = 6a0, for (f). In the case of the wide leads (III), it is worth noting that the DFP theory reproduces the gradual widening of the spikes as a function of increasing energy; naturally this trend results from the weakening of the confinement effect due to a stronger coupling to the leads for higher energies. The horizontal solid lines at G = 1G0 (blue online) in (d) and (f) describe the DFP conductance obtained when employing a potential V(x) double barrier similar in shape to the schematic in (IV) and the assumption (x) = 0; the result is independent of the potential barrier's heights.

Compared to Fig. 3, the subtle modifications of mass parameters brought about by having t = 1.12t result in having six sharp electronic states see (c) below the onset (at ) of the first band in the leads see (d), which consequently do not generate any conductance resonances see (a) and (b).

Strong electron-phonon coupling λ in compressed BP is found, in particular for C2/m phase with the zigzag phosphorus chain, which has the highest λ (0.56\u20130.61) value among them, leading to its high superconducting critical temperature Tc (9.4 K\u201311.5 K), which is comparable with the 4.5 K to 13 K value of black phosphorus phase I (orthorhombic, Cmca). This is the first system in the boron phosphides which shows superconductivity from the present theoretical calculations.

        "text": "Application of alginate-microencapsulated therapeutic cells is a promising approach for diseases that require a local and constant supply of therapeutic molecules. However most conventional alginate microencapsulation systems are associated with low mechanical stability and protrusion of cells which is associated with higher surface roughness and limits their clinical application. Here we have developed a novel multilayer encapsulation system that prevents cells from protruding from capsules. The system was tested using a therapeutic protein with anti-tumor activity overexpressed in mammalian cells. The cell containing core of the multilayer capsule was formed by flexible alginate, creating a cell sustaining environment. Surrounded by a poly-L-lysine layer the flexible core was enveloped in a high-G alginate matrix that is less flexible and has higher mechanical stability, which does not support cell survival. The cells in the core of the multilayer capsule did not show growth impairment and protein production was normal for periods up to 70 days in vitro. The additional alginate layer also lowered the surface roughness compared to conventional cell containing alginate-PLL capsules. Our system provides a solution for two important, often overlooked phenomena in cell encapsulation: preventing cell protrusion and improving surface roughness.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information Charge transport in molecular systems, including DNA, is involved in many basic chemical and biological processes, and its understanding is critical if they are to be used in electronic devices. This important phenomenon is often described as either coherent tunnelling over a short distance or incoherent hopping over a long distance. Here, we show evidence of an intermediate regime where coherent and incoherent processes coexist in double-stranded DNA. We measure charge transport in single DNA molecules bridged to two electrodes as a function of DNA sequence and length. In general, the resistance of DNA increases linearly with length, as expected for incoherent hopping. However, for DNA sequences with stacked guanine\u2013cytosine (GC) base pairs, a periodic oscillation is superimposed on the linear length dependence, indicating partial coherent transport. This result is supported by the finding of strong delocalization of the highest occupied molecular orbitals of GC by theoretical simulation and by modelling based on the Büttiker theory of partial coherent charge transport. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Direct measurement of charge transport in dsDNA attached to two electrodes. a, DNA molecules connected to two electrodes via the sugar10 (left) and directly via the \u200bthymine base (T, right). The red part of the chemical scheme is the original T base, and the blue part is the amine modification.

Figure 2: Resistance and structure of alternating (A(CG)nT) and stacked (ACnGnT) G DNA sequences. a, Resistance of alternating (black squares) and stacked (blue triangles) G DNA sequences versus the number of CG in the sequences. The stacked sequences have smaller resistance values than alternating sequences, and an oscillation is superimposed on the linear trend. Error bars are standard deviations calculated from three to four sets of experiments for each individual sequence (Supplementary Table 1). b, Three-dimensional structures of alternating ((CG)4, left) and stacked (C4G4, right) G dsDNA, showing a better overlap between adjacent G bases for stacked G sequences than alternating sequences. This is also supported by the calculated electronic couplings at the INDO/S level between adjacent base pairs, indicated as VG\u2013C for the alternating sequence and VG\u2013G for the stacked sequence. Figure 3: Hopping transport in alternating G DNA sequences. Holes from the left electrode migrate through each of the hopping sites and finally reach the right electrode, generating a current when a small bias Vbias is applied between the left and right electrodes. kL, k1, kR and k are the hole transfer rate constants from the left electrode to the first G of the DNA, from the first G back to the left electrode, from the last G of the DNA to the right electrode, and between adjacent hopping sites, respectively. The HOMOs of the G bases, which are responsible for hole hopping, are strongly localized in single G bases, and the corresponding energy levels are degenerate, which indicates that each of the G bases in the dsDNA is a hopping site. Note that (CG)4 is shown here as an example. Figure 4: Intermediate tunnelling\u2013hopping charge transport in stacked DNA sequences. a, Top: schematic of the intermediate tunnelling\u2013hopping transport mechanism in stacked sequences, where Tmulti_G is the probability of transmission via the stacked G-segments of the DNA including the coherent correction, TGG-st is the probability of transmission between two adjacent stacked Gs, and TGG-al is the probability of transmission between the two stacked G-segments. TGG-st and TGG-al have incoherent components only. Bottom: HOMO levels of C4G4 show delocalization of the orbitals, in contrast to Fig. 3, indicating that the coherent tunnelling transport coexists with incoherent hopping transport through the stacked G-segments. Note that, as for alternating sequences, there is no delocalization between the fourth G and fifth G in the middle. b, Experimental resistance (blue triangles) and prediction of Büttiker theory (see equation (2)) of partial coherent charge transport (red circles), indicating that the oscillation is caused by coherent processes when holes transport through stacked G-segments.

        "text": "\u200bSilicon is ubiquitous in contemporary technology. The most stable form of \u200bsilicon at ambient conditions takes on the structure of diamond (cF8, d-Si) and is an indirect bandgap semiconductor, which prevents it from being considered as a next-generation platform for semiconductor technologies1, 2, 3, 4. Here, we report the formation of a new orthorhombic allotrope of \u200bsilicon, Si24, using a novel two-step synthesis methodology. First, a Na4Si24 precursor was synthesized at high pressure5; second, sodium was removed from the precursor by a thermal \u2018degassing\u2019 process. The Cmcm structure of Si24, which has 24 Si atoms per unit cell (oC24), contains open channels along the crystallographic a-axis that are formed from six- and eight-membered sp3 silicon rings. This new allotrope possesses a quasidirect bandgap near 1.3 eV. Our combined experimental/theoretical study expands the known allotropy for element fourteen and the unique high-pressure precursor synthesis methodology demonstrates the potential for new materials with desirable properties.

        "text": "We report investigations on the influences of post-deposition treatments on the performance of solution-processed methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3)-based planar solar cells. The prepared films were stored in pure N2 at room temperature or annealed in pure O2 at room temperature, 45°C, 65°C and 85°C for 12 hours prior to the deposition of the metal electrodes. It is found that annealing in O2 leads to substantial increase in the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the devices. Furthermore, strong dependence on the annealing temperature for the PCEs of the devices suggests that a thermally activated process may underlie the observed phenomenon. It is believed that the annealing process may facilitate the diffusion of O2 into the spiro-MeOTAD for inducing p-doping of the hole transport material. Furthermore, the process can result in lowering the localized state density at the grain boundaries as well as the bulk of perovskite. Utilizing thermal assisted O2 annealing, high efficiency devices with good reproducibility were attained. A PCE of 15.4% with an open circuit voltage (VOC) 1.04 V, short circuit current density (JSC) 23 mA/cm2, and fill factor 0.64 had been achieved for our champion device.

        "text": "Nanostructure arrays such as nanowire, nanopillar, and nanocone arrays have been proposed to be promising antireflection structures for photovoltaic applications due to their great light trapping ability. In this paper, the optical properties of Si nanopillar and nanocone arrays in visible and infrared region were studied by both theoretical calculations and experiments. The results show that the Mie resonance can be continuously tuned across a wide range of wavelength by varying the diameter of the nanopillars. However, Si nanopillar array with uniform diameter exhibits only discrete resonance mode, thus can't achieve a high broadband absorption. On the other hand, the Mie resonance wavelength in a Si nanocone array can vary continuously as the diameters of the cross sections increase from the apex to the base. Therefore Si nanocone arrays can strongly interact with the incident light in the broadband spectrum and the absorbance by Si nanocone arrays is higher than 95% over the wavelength from 300 to 2000 nm. In addition to the Mie resonance, the broadband optical absorption of Si nanocone arrays is also affected by Wood-Rayleigh anomaly effect and metal impurities introduced in the fabrication process.

        "text": "The diverse functionality emerging at oxide interfaces calls for a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms and control parameters of electronic reconstructions. Here, we explore the evolution of electronic phases in (LaAlO3)M/(SrTiO3)N (001) superlattices as a function of strain and confinement of the SrTiO3 quantum well. Density functional theory calculations including a Hubbard U term reveal a charge ordered Ti3+ and Ti4+ state for N = 2 with an unanticipated orbital reconstruction, displaying alternating dxz and dyz character at the Ti3+ sites, unlike the previously reported dxy state, obtained only for reduced c-parameter at aSTO. At aLAO c-compression leads to a Dimer-Mott insulator with alternating dxz, dyz sites and an almost zero band gap. Beyond a critical thickness of N = 3 (aSTO) and N = 4 (aLAO) an insulator-to-metal transition takes place, where the extra e/2 electron at the interface is redistributed throughout the STO slab with a dxy interface orbital occupation and a mixed dxz + dyz occupation in the inner layers. Chemical variation of the SrTiO3 counterpart (LaAlO3 vs. NdGaO3) proves that the significant octahedral tilts and distortions in the SrTiO3 quantum well are induced primarily by the electrostatic doping at the polar interface and not by variation of the SrTiO3 counterpart.

        "text": "A facile and phase-controlled synthesis of α-NiS nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in carbon nanorods (CRs) is reported by in-situ sulfurating the preformed Ni/CRs. The nanopore confinement by the carbon matrix is essential for the formation of α-NiS and preventing its transition to β-phase, which is in strong contrast to large aggregated β-NiS particles grown freely without the confinement of CRs. When used as electrochemical electrode, the hybrid electrochemical charge storage of the ultrasmall α-NiS nanoparticels dispersed in CRs is benefit for the high capacitor (1092, 946, 835, 740 F g−1 at current densities of 1, 2, 5, 10 A g−1, respectively.). While the high electrochemical stability (approximately 100% retention of specific capacitance after 2000 charge/discharge cycles) is attributed to the supercapacitor-battery electrode, which makes synergistic effect of capacitor (CRs) and battery (NiS NPs) components rather than a merely additive composite. This work not only suggests a general approach for phase-controlled synthesis of nickel sulfide but also opens the door to the rational design and fabrication of novel nickel-based/carbon hybrid supercapacitor-battery electrode materials.

Here, we show with experiments and computer simulations that Janus ellipsoids can self-assemble into self-limiting one-dimensional fibres with shape-memory properties, and that the fibrillar assemblies can be actuated on application of an external alternating-current electric field. Actuation of the fibres occurs through a sliding mechanism that permits the rapid and reversible elongation and contraction of the Janus-ellipsoid chains by ~36% and that on long timescales leads to the generation of long, uniform self-assembled fibres. Colloidal-scale actuation might be useful in microrobotics and in applications of shape-memory materials.

At the 10-nm length scale, metal crystallinity and patterning as well as probing of surface plasmon properties must be controlled with a challenging high level of precision. Here, we demonstrate that ultimate lateral confinement and delocalization of surface plasmon modes are simultaneously achieved in extended self-assembled networks comprising linear chains of partially fused \u200bgold nanoparticles. The spectral and spatial distributions of the surface plasmon modes associated with the colloidal superstructures are evidenced by performing monochromated electron energy-loss spectroscopy with a nanometre-sized electron probe. We prepare the metallic bead strings by electron-beam-induced interparticle fusion of nanoparticle networks. The fused superstructures retain the native morphology and crystallinity but develop very low-energy surface plasmon modes that are capable of supporting long-range and spectrally tunable propagation in nanoscale waveguides.

        "text": "The radiation of an electric dipole emitter can be drastically enhanced if the emitter is placed in the nano-gap of a metallic dipole antenna. By assuming that only surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are excited on the antenna, we build up an intuitive pure-SPP model that is able to comprehensively predict the electromagnetic features of the antenna radiation, such as the total or radiative emission rate and the far-field radiation pattern. With the model we can distinguish the respective contributions from SPPs and from other surface waves to the antenna radiation. It is found that for antennas with long arms that support higher-order resonances, SPPs provide a dominant contribution to the antenna radiation, while for other cases, the contribution of surface waves other than SPPs should be considered. The model reveals an intuitive picture that the enhancement of the antenna radiation is due to surface waves that are resonantly excited on the two antenna arms and that are further coupled into the nano-gap or scattered into free space. From the model we can derive a phase-matching condition that predicts the antenna resonance and the resultant enhanced radiation. The model is helpful for a physical understanding and intuitive design of antenna devices.

        "text": "The melting temperature of a nanoscaled particle is known to decrease as the curvature of the solid-melt interface increases. This relationship is most often modelled by a Gibbs\u2013Thomson law, with the decrease in melting temperature proposed to be a product of the curvature of the solid-melt interface and the surface tension. Such a law must break down for sufficiently small particles, since the curvature becomes singular in the limit that the particle radius vanishes. Furthermore, the use of this law as a boundary condition for a Stefan-type continuum model is problematic because it leads to a physically unrealistic form of mathematical blow-up at a finite particle radius. By numerical simulation, we show that the inclusion of nonequilibrium interface kinetics in the Gibbs\u2013Thomson law regularises the continuum model, so that the mathematical blow up is suppressed. As a result, the solution continues until complete melting, and the corresponding melting temperature remains finite for all time. The results of the adjusted model are consistent with experimental findings of abrupt melting of nanoscaled particles. This small-particle regime appears to be closely related to the problem of melting a superheated particle.

        "text": "World-wide studies on multi-junction (tandem) solar cells have led to record-breaking improvements in conversion efficiencies year after year. To obtain detailed and proper feedback for solar-cell design and fabrication, it is necessary to establish standard methods for diagnosing subcells in fabricated tandem devices. Here, we propose a potential standard method to quantify the detailed subcell properties of multi-junction solar cells based on absolute measurements of electroluminescence (EL) external quantum efficiency in addition to the conventional solar-cell external-quantum-efficiency measurements. We demonstrate that the absolute-EL-quantum-efficiency measurements provide I\u2013V relations of individual subcells without the need for referencing measured I\u2013V data, which is in stark contrast to previous works. Moreover, our measurements quantify the absolute rates of junction loss, non-radiative loss, radiative loss, and luminescence coupling in the subcells, which constitute the \u201cbalance sheets\u201d of tandem solar cells.

Note that the y-axis of the EL spectra is the absolute photon number per second divided by the injection carrier number per second, i.e., the y-axis represents the external EL quantum efficiency (yextLED) as a function of the photon energy. Consequently, the yextLED of the subcells (Fig. 1d) can be obtained through the integrations of the EL peaks in the EL spectra.

        "text": "The short-range order (SRO) in Pd78Cu6Si16 liquid was studied by high energy x-ray diffraction and ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The calculated pair correlation functions at different temperatures agree well with the experimental results. The partial pair correlation functions from ab intio MD simulations indicate that Si atoms prefer to be uniformly distributed while Cu atoms tend to aggregate. By performing structure analysis using Honeycutt-Andersen index, Voronoi tessellation, and atomic cluster alignment method, we show that the icosahedron and face-centered cubic SRO increase upon cooling. The dominant SRO is the Pd-centered Pd9Si2 motif, namely the structure of which motif is similar to the structure of Pd-centered clusters in the Pd9Si2 crystal. The study further confirms the existence of trigonal prism capped with three half-octahedra that is reported as a structural unit in Pd-based amorphous alloys. The majority of Cu-centered clusters are icosahedra, suggesting that the presence of Cu is benefit to promote the glass forming ability.

        "text": "Recent schemes to encode quantum information into the total angular momentum of light, defining rotation-invariant hybrid qubits composed of the polarization and orbital angular momentum degrees of freedom, present interesting applications for quantum information technology. However, there remains the question as to how detrimental effects such as random spatial perturbations affect these encodings. Here, we demonstrate that alignment-free quantum communication through a turbulent channel based on hybrid qubits can be achieved with unit transmission fidelity. In our experiment, alignment-free qubits are produced with q-plates and sent through a homemade turbulence chamber. The decoding procedure, also realized with q-plates, relies on both degrees of freedom and renders an intrinsic error-filtering mechanism that maps errors into losses.

Compared with the traditional methods, the vacuum activation involves a low temperature and low-costing, which can achieve the reduction of GO, the self doping of Ti3+ in TiO2 and the loading of TiO2 nanoparticles on GR surface at the same time. These resulting TiO2-graphene composites show the high photodegradation rate of MO, high hydrogen evolution activity and excellent IPCE in the visible light irradiation.

By increasing the hydrophobic ability of side chain moieties, there is a gradually blue shift for the maximum absorption wavelength and red shift for the maximum emission wavelength, a reducing trend for fluorescence quantum yields, a growing trend for Stokes shift, and an increasing trend for the mean sizes in the order of PT, PT-ADA, and PT-DDA. All the synthesized polymers show low toxicity and good photostability and accumulate in the lysosomes of A549 cells. Furthermore, the introduction of porphyrin group to PT-ADA side chain (PT-ADA-PPR) broadens the absorption and emission ranges of PT-ADA. PT-ADA-PPR could be excited at two different excitation wavelengths (488 nm and 559 nm) and exhibits two emission pathways, and dual-color fluorescence images (orange and red) of PT-ADA-PPR accumulated in A549 cells are observed.

Here, we report the fractal analysis of hierarchical single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films realized by a simple, rapid, reproducible, and inexpensive filtration process from an aqueous dispersion, then deposited by drytransfer printing method on several substrates, at room temperature. Furthermore, by varying the thickness of carbon nanotube random networks, it is possible tailoring their wettability due to capillary phenomena in the porous films. Moreover, in order to describe the wetting properties of such surfaces, we introduce a two-dimensional extension of the Wenzel-Cassie-Baxter theory.

        "text": "While behavior of equilibrium systems is well understood, evolution of nonequilibrium ones is much less clear. Yet, many researches have suggested that the principle of the maximum entropy production is of key importance in complex systems away from equilibrium. Here, we present a quantitative study of large ensembles of carbon nanotubes suspended in a non-conducting non-polar fluid subject to a strong electric field. Being driven out of equilibrium, the suspension spontaneously organizes into an electrically conducting state under a wide range of parameters. Such self-assembly allows the Joule heating and, therefore, the entropy production in the fluid, to be maximized. Curiously, we find that emerging self-assembled structures can start to wiggle. The wiggling takes place only until the entropy production in the suspension reaches its maximum, at which time the wiggling stops and the structure becomes quasi-stable. Thus, we provide strong evidence that maximum entropy production principle plays an essential role in the evolution of self-organizing systems far from equilibrium.

        "text": "High-quality protein crystals of suitable size are an important prerequisite for applying X-ray crystallography to determine the 3-dimensional structure of proteins. However, it is often difficult to obtain protein crystals of appropriate size and quality because nucleation and growth processes can be unsuccessful. Here, we show that by adsorbing proteins onto porous polystyrene-divinylbenzene microspheres (SDB) floating on the surface of the crystallisation solution, a localised high supersaturation region at the surface of the microspheres and a low supersaturation region below the microspheres can coexist in a single solution. The crystals will easily nucleate in the region of high supersaturation, but when they grow to a certain size, they will sediment to the region of low supersaturation and continue to grow. In this way, the probability of crystallisation and crystal quality can be simultaneously increased in a single solution without changing other crystallisation parameters. Subject terms: X-ray crystallography\u2022 Materials science\u2022 Surface chemistry At a glance Figures View all figures Figure 1: Normalised crystallisation hits in the presence and absence of SDB microspheres. The addition of SDB1 and SDB2 remarkably increased the number of crystallisation hits (error bars: standard error of the mean, n = 11). The number of screening hits was normalised based on the number of hits obtained using SDB2. Both SDB1 and SDB2 microspheres increased the number of hits, and the effect of SDB1 was most obvious.

(b) Schematic illustration of the change in concentration with time during the crystallisation in the presence and absence of the SDB microspheres. When no microspheres are present, the concentration evolution will follow the dashed blue line; when microspheres are added to the solution, adsorption of the protein molecules will lower the concentration in the solution (the black line), and at the same time, the concentration on the surface of the microspheres will increase (the red line). After nucleation and the initial growth on the surface of the microspheres, the crystals will sediment to the bottom. Thus, the concentration near the crystals will be that at the bottom of the solution (the red line). Full size image View in article",

Due to the pseudo-seven-fold symmetry of \u200bcoronin\u2019s seven-bladed propeller, there are seven possible modes of docking. The docking that we chose in our paper (a) is significantly (>5 SD) better than other possible dockings. The last possible mode (model rotated by 6/7×360°) cannot be generated, since the docking program automatically fits it towards the best model (a).

The two pseudo-atomic models are morphed back and forth as a movie in two orthogonal views. The movie starts with the viewpoint similar to Figure 2a, showing the model in ADP state. It then morphs to ADP-BeFx state and back to ADP state. The model then rotates 90° about its helical axis, and performs the same morphing again.

In this work, we demonstrate that ZnO NR arrays grown on Ag layers can significantly improve the enhancement up to 86 times compared to that grown on bare Si, and the enhancement can be modified in a controlled manner by varying Ag thickness. The much improved waveguide properties are attributed to the high reflectance of the Ag layers and their tuning effect on the diameters of ZnO NRs.

        "text": "The propagation and transport of electrons in crystals is a fundamental process pertaining to the functioning of most electronic devices. Microscopic theories describe this phenomenon as being based on the motion of Bloch wave packets1. These wave packets are superpositions of individual Bloch states with the group velocity determined by the dispersion of the electronic band structure near the central wavevector in momentum space1. This concept has been verified experimentally in artificial superlattices by the observation of Bloch oscillations2\u2014periodic oscillations of electrons in real and momentum space. Here we present a direct observation of electron wave packet motion in a real-space and real-time experiment, on length and time scales shorter than the Bloch oscillation amplitude and period. We show that attosecond metrology3 (1 as = 10−18 seconds) now enables quantitative insight into weakly disturbed electron wave packet propagation on the atomic length scale without being hampered by scattering effects, which inevitably occur over macroscopic propagation length scales. We use sub-femtosecond (less than 10−15 seconds) extreme-ultraviolet light pulses3 to launch photoelectron wave packets inside a tungsten crystal that is covered by magnesium films of varied, well-defined thicknesses of a few ångströms4. Probing the moment of arrival of the wave packets at the surface with attosecond precision reveals free-electron-like, ballistic propagation behaviour inside the magnesium adlayer\u2014constituting the semi-classical limit of Bloch wave packet motion. Real-time access to electron transport through atomic layers and interfaces promises unprecedented insight into phenomena that may enable the scaling of electronic and photonic circuits to atomic dimensions. In addition, this experiment allows us to determine the penetration depth of electrical fields at optical frequencies at solid interfaces on the atomic scale. Subject terms: Electronic properties and materials At a glance Figures Figure 1: Spatio-temporal dynamics in attosecond photoemission from Mg/W(110). a, Principle of the experiment: photoelectrons (green dots) are launched inside a tungsten W(110) crystal and a magnesium (Mg) overlayer a few ångströms thick by an XUV pulse of ~450 as, and are detected in ultrahigh vacuum with a time-of-flight analyser. At the surface, the arrival times of electrons released from different initial states are probed by streaking their associated electron energy distributions with a 2 × 1011 W cm−2 strong electric field delivered by a sub-5 fs broadband linearly polarized visible/near-infrared laser pulse. Relative time delays Δτ developing during the propagation of the photoelectrons to the metal\u2013vacuum interface are detected as temporal shifts between their streaked energy distributions. The time shifts Δτ are sensitive to the atomic-scale electron transport characteristics (quantified by the inelastic mean free path λ; indicated only for the W 4f electrons), the Mg overlayer thickness and the screening behaviour of the laser field at the solid\u2013vacuum interface. b, Schematic energy-level diagram for the probed electronic transitions. The central XUV photon energy of ~118 eV allows the simultaneous excitation of Mg 2p, W 4f and the joint CB states (binding energy Ebin as indicated). A background-corrected photoelectron spectrum of n = 4 adlayers of Mg on W(110) in the absence of the laser field is shown as the black solid line. For better visibility, the strength of the CB and W 4f signals are magnified by a factor of six. Figure 2: Attosecond time-resolved photoemission from Mg/W(110). a, Representative streaking spectrogram for n = 4 Mg monolayers (ML). All photoelectron spectra are corrected for the inelastic electron background signal. The strength of the CB and W 4f signals is magnified by a factor of 6 for better visibility. b, Exemplary timing analysis of the Mg 2p and W 4f core-level electrons: the first moments calculated from their respective kinetic energy distributions are shown as red crosses (Mg 2p) and blue crosses (W 4f) as functions of NIR\u2013XUV delay Δt. A global fit of the resultant streaking traces to a parameterized waveform for the NIR vector potential (solid lines) reveals a relative time shift Δτ[4f - 2p], which can be identified with the time delay occurring during the release of the electrons from the metal surface. Insets illustrate the evolution of Δτ[4f - 2p] for 0 n ≤ 4. Regions exhibiting the largest gradient of the streaking field (corresponding to the highest temporal resolution) are highlighted. An analogous evaluation of Δτ[CB - 2p] is presented in the Supplementary Information. Figure 3: Atomic-scale photoelectron transport and screening of the incident light field. a, Time delays Δτ[4f - 2p] between the release of W 4f and Mg 2p electrons extracted from a large set of streaking spectrograms with different numbers of Mg adlayers are shown as blue diamonds. Error bars denote full standard deviations and are obtained by averaging measurements performed under similar experimental conditions. Fractional adlayers correspond to dispersed two-dimensional islands (on top of a completed Mg layer) that coalesce upon further Mg deposition. Green lines are time delays predicted by our one-dimensional (1D) simulation of the photoelectron release dynamics for different screening lengths δ assuming an exponentially decaying normal component of the incident NIR streaking field at the metal\u2013vacuum interface according to . The light-green-shaded area highlights the screening scenarios compatible with the experiment. Red squares indicate time delays derived from a full three-dimensional electron transport model (the red line is a guide to the eye). b, The upper panel illustrates the different screening scenarios for EL(z, t) considered in a for the example of n = 2 Mg adlayers (orange shading) on W(110) (grey shading). The red line is the spatial variation of EL(z, t) at the interface predicted by TDDFT. The lower panel is a snapshot of the NIR-induced charge density at the metal\u2013vacuum interface at the maximum of the laser pulse derived by TDDFT (magenta line). The position of the dynamic image plane zim is indicated as a vertical black solid line. The lattice potential (averaged parallel to the crystal surface) employed in the DFT calculations is shown as a dotted black line. The positions of the Mg and W atoms at the interface along the surface normal are indicated as black dots. The gradual transitions from the W electronic structure (grey) to the Mg electronic structure (orange) and to the vacuum (white) are indicated in the background colours. c, Comparison of time shifts Δτ[CB - 2p] measured between the emission of CB and Mg 2p electrons with time delays predicted by the three-dimensional (3D) electron transport model.

        "text": "Recent experiments indicate that frictional sliding occurs by nucleation of detachment fronts at the contact interface that may appear well before the onset of global sliding. This intriguing precursory activity is not accounted for by traditional friction theories but is extremely important for friction dominated geophysical phenomena as earthquakes, landslides or avalanches. Here we simulate the onset of slip of a three dimensional elastic body resting on a surface and show that experimentally observed frictional precursors depend in a complex non-universal way on the sample geometry and loading conditions. Our model satisfies Archard's law and Amontons' first and second laws, reproducing with remarkable precision the real contact area dynamics, the precursors' envelope dynamics prior to sliding, and the normal and shear internal stress distributions close to the interfacial surface. Moreover, it allows to assess which features can be attributed to the elastic equilibrium, and which are attributed to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics, suggesting that precursory activity is an intrinsically quasi-static physical process. A direct calculation of the evolution of the Coulomb stress before and during precursors nucleation shows large variations across the sample, explaining why earthquake forecasting methods based only on accumulated slip and Coulomb stress monitoring are often ineffective. Subject terms: Surfaces, interfaces and thin films\u2022 Statistical physics At a glance Figures View all figures Figure 1: The dependence of slip precursors on the sample size and the point of application of the lateral force. (a) Experimental data (symbols) from Ref. 4 obtained for different Lx and FN show an approximate data collapse when the rescaled front position /Lx is plotted against the rescaled lateral shearing force (Ly = 7 mm, Lz = 75 mm, h = 6 mm). This result is accurately reproduced by our model (solid lines). Inset shows that when the range of Lx is increased further, collapse is lost (100 mm < Lx < 350 mm). (b) Similarly, experimental data (symbols) from Ref. 4 indicate that the rescaled precursors profiles are approximately independent of the height h (the point of application of the lateral force ), in perfect agreement with the numerical outcomes (solid lines). Lx = 140 mm, Ly = 7 mm, Lz = 75 mm, FN = 3 kN. In the inset, we show that no collapse arises if h is increased beyond the experimental values (2 mm < h < 73 mm). Full size image View in article Figure 2: The dependence of slip precursors on the sample aspect ratios and on the loading conditions. Rescaled precursors quasi-static evolution obtained when an uniform side shear is applied. (a) Curves exhibit the same universal behavior for different Lx and Ly but same aspect ratio , with FN = 4 kN and Lz = 10 mm. (b) Perfect collapse of the curves is obtained when the aspect ratio Lx/Lz and Ly are kept constant. , Ly = 7 mm, FN = 4 kN. (c) Precursors progressively disappear when Ly and Lz are increased by leaving unchanged the ratio Ly/Lz, and Lx is constant. , Lx = 40 mm, FN = 4 kN. This findings are consistent with the assumption that precursors evolution profiles reflect the same simmetries appearing in the shear stress at the frictional interface S97, which is function of the quantity . (d) While simultaneously loading the sample from top and from the edge with a rod (h = 6 mm and h = 2 mm), , precursors dynamics is suppressed for large n. Sample parameters are FN = 2.7 kN, Lx = 201 mm, Ly = 7 mm Lz = 132 mm. Full size image View in article Figure 3: Coulomb stress as slip precursor. (a) Normal (red) and shear stress (blu) averaged over the y direction. Profiles of and across the sample length are calculated on a reference plane zP = 2 mm above the frictional interface (solid lines) and compared with the experimental data from Ref. 2 (Fig. 2A, slow front) (symbols-dashed lines). Shear force was applied on top as well as on the sample trailing edge according to the experimental setup (Ref. 2). Stress calculation was performed at a value of the shear force FS right before the nucleation of the precursor (see Fig. S10 and Fig. 8(a)). Lx = 200 mm, Ly = 7 mm, Lz = 100 mm, FN = 6.25 kN. (b) Coulomb stress calculated on the reference plane above the contact interface and averaged over the y direction (solid green line): C(x, zP) = | (x, zP)| | (x, zP)|. Comparison with data inferred from Ref. 2 is excellent (green symbols-dashed line). The magenta line represents the y-averaged Coulomb stress at the frictional interface : although no detachment front is yet present at the contact plane ( C(x, 0) < 0 throughout the surface), the value of the Coulomb stress at the reference plane zP = 2 mm can exceed locally the threshold, leading to the erroneous conclusion that Amonton-Coulomb law might be violated.

(a)\u2013(d) Quasi-static evolution of the Coulomb stress (averaged over y) along the slab x \u2013 z plane (on top), and on the plane z = zP (bottom panels). Color code indicates regions where C > 0 (yellow\u2013red) from those for which C < 0 (blu), grey solid lines correspond to the set of points fulfilling C = 0. Panel (a) refers to the slider sitution before the first precursor event nucleates, the plane z = zP = 2 mm (bottom panels) is where quantities in Fig. 7 are calculated (see also Fig. S10 dashed black lines). Grey dashed lines represent the precursor envelope at the frictional interface, obtained from the real contact area decay (see Fig. 2(b)(inset) and Fig. 3). Full size image View in article Figure 5: Graphical illustration of the model. We consider a block of dimensions Lx, Ly and Lz in contact with a rough surface (sketched in the middle panel). A normal force FN and a shear force are applied uniformly on the top surface along z and x respectively, a lateral force is applied on the sample trailing edge over a rectangular region of width 2 h at height h. The bottom surface of the block is discretized on a grid of size x × y (we invariably chose y = x = 1 mm, see also Fig. S1). Each grid element central point may form an elastic contact with the rough surface, that is modelled by a set of elastic asperities of height , and effective transverse and normal stiffness kx and kz, respectively. Full size image View in article Figure 6: Scalar model numerical calibration. (a) The value of the normal stiffness kz is set by measuring the change of the real area of contact (in % of the nominal contact area A0) as a function of the normal load FN, and comparing the numerical results (squares) with the experimental data from Ref. 31 (solid line). Lx = 30 mm, Ly = 6 mm, Lz = 150 mm. (b) The transverse stiffness kx is obtained by matching the quasi-static evolution of the precursor position (solid black line) with the corresponding experimental data reported in Ref. 4 (red circles). Lx = 140 mm, Ly = 7 mm, Lz = 75 mm, FN = 3.5 kN. The inset shows the front propagation by imaging the real contact area AR(FS) averaged over the y direction and normalized to its initial value AR(0) (the image is the top view of the histogram shown in Fig. 3(b)). Color code: blue reflects a decrease of the real area of contact with respect to the initial value, while red highlights a prominent increase. Precursor fronts correspond to the edge of the blu part of the plot. Full size image View in article Figure 7: Real area of contact and determination of precursors size. (a) Successive snapshots of the contact area, normalized to its initial value, show the advancement of the slip precursors as is increased. Dark (pale) blue indicates a decrease (increase) in the contact area. (a)\u2013(c) Quasi-static evolution of the average real area of contact (normalized to the zero-shear value AR(0)) for three type of loading conditions: with a rod (h = 6 mm, h = 2 mm) (b), uniformly from a side (c), and uniformly from top (d). FN = 2.7 kN, Lx = 200 mm, Ly = 7 mm, Lz = 75 mm. Color map goes from blue to red : for any value of FS, blu region corresponds to the precursor size, and the boundary between blu and red/yellow regions represents the precursor size . Regions close to the trailing edge experience a decay of the real contact area as FS is adiabatically increased, whereas the real area of contact area considerably grows on the opposite side ((a) and (b)). When the sample is loaded uniformly from top, the sliding takes place without precursors appearence (c). Full size image View in article Figure 8: Stick-slip under displacement controlled driving. We report the force on the driving spring as a function of the imposed displacement for the following same sample parameters: Lx = 140 mm, Ly = 7 mm, Lz = 75 mm, FN = 3.5 kN.

        "text": "Quantum dot (QD)-metal oxide composite forms a \u201cheart\u201d of the QD-sensitized solar cells. It maintains light absorption and electron-hole separation in the system and has been therefore extensively studied. The interest is largely driven by a vision of harvesting the hot carrier energy before it is lost via relaxation. Despite of importance of the process, very little is known about the carrier relaxation in the QD-metal oxide composites. In order to fill this gap of knowledge we carry out a systematic study of initial electron dynamics in different CdSe QD systems. Our data reveal that QD attachment to ZnO induces a speeding-up of transient absorption onset. Detailed analysis of the onset proves that the changes are caused by an additional relaxation channel dependent on the identity of the QD-ZnO linker molecule. The faster relaxation represents an important factor for hot carrier energy harvesting, whose efficiency can be influenced by almost 50%.

        "text": "Thanks to their special interaction with light, semiconductor nanowires have opened new avenues in photonics, quantum optics and solar energy harvesting. One of the major challenges for their full technological deployment has been their strong polarization dependence in light absorption and emission. In the past, metal nanostructures have been shown to have the ability to modify and enhance the light response of nanoscale objects. Here we demonstrate that a hybrid structure formed by GaAs nanowires with a highly dense array of bow-tie antennas is able to modify the polarization response of a nanowire. As a result, the increase in light absorption for transverse polarized light changes the nanowire polarization response, including the polarization response inversion. This work will open a new path towards the widespread implementation of nanowires applications such as in photodetection, solar energy harvesting and light emission.

        "text": "A priori prediction of supracolloidal architectures from nanoparticle and colloidal assembly is a challenging goal in materials chemistry and physics. Despite intense research in this area, much less has been known about the predictive science of supracolloidal helices from designed building blocks. Therefore, developing conceptually new rules to construct supracolloidal architectures with predictive helicity is becoming an important and urgent task of great scientific interest. Here, inspired by biological helices, we show that the rational design of patchy arrangement and interaction can drive patchy particles to self-assemble into biomolecular mimetic supracolloidal helices. We further derive a facile design rule for encoding the target supracolloidal helices, thus opening the doors to the predictive science of these supracolloidal architectures. It is also found that kinetics and reaction pathway during the formation of supracolloidal helices offer a unique way to study supramolecular polymerization, and that well-controlled supracolloidal helices can exhibit tailorable circular dichroism effects at visible wavelengths.

        "text": "Thermal dissipation at the active region of electronic devices is a fundamental process of considerable importance1, 2, 3. Inadequate heat dissipation can lead to prohibitively large temperature rises that degrade performance4, 5, 6, 7, and intensive efforts are under way to mitigate this self-heating8, 9, 10, 11, 12. At room temperature, thermal resistance is due to scattering, often by defects and interfaces in the active region, that impedes the transport of phonons. Here, we demonstrate that heat dissipation in widely used cryogenic electronic devices13, 14, 15, 16 instead occurs by phonon black-body radiation with the complete absence of scattering, leading to large self-heating at cryogenic temperatures and setting a key limit on the noise floor. Our result has important implications for the many fields that require ultralow-noise electronic devices. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Optical micrographs and noise measurements of a low-noise amplifier integrated circuit. a, Optical microscopy image showing part of the 4\u201316 GHz MMIC amplifier. In the image are the three \u200bInP HEMTs, microstrip lines, \u200bNiCr thin-film resistors (TFRs) and metal\u2013insulator\u2013metal (MIM) capacitors. b, Scanning electron micrograph image of an \u200bInP HEMT. Inset: schematic view of the HEMT cross-section. The HEMT is grown on an \u200bInP substrate with an InAlAs buffer for lattice matching, an InGaAs channel, and a doped \u200bInGaAs barrier to provide ohmic contacts. c, Measured noise temperature (symbols) and predicted linear scaling (dashed line) versus low-noise amplifier (LNA) chassis temperature of the device at 12 GHz. The measured noise temperature decreases linearly with a decrease in the chassis temperature until about 40 K, below which it saturates, deviating from the ideal prediction. d, Extracted drain temperature (symbols) and extrapolated linear scaling (dashed line) versus LNA chassis temperature. The measured drain temperature exhibits the same saturation for chassis temperatures below 40 K. The error bars are obtained by propagating the uncertainty in measurements from the noise figure analyser through the circuit model used to determine the noise temperature. Figure 2: Calculated steady-state lattice temperature profiles with Joule heating. a\u2013d, Simulations were performed with 29 mW mm−1 input power for device operating temperatures of 300 K (a), 20 K (b), 10 K (c) and 0.1 K (d). Below 20 K the peak temperature in the channel remains almost constant despite the substantial decrease in the device operating temperature. The horizontal black lines indicate interfaces in the actual device for reference; no interfaces are included in the simulations. Figure 3: Temperature saturation and intrinsic temperature rise. a, Calculated channel temperature versus device operating temperature for various power inputs from MC simulation. The simulation reproduces the observed trend of a temperature saturation when the device operating temperature becomes sufficiently low for non-zero power dissipation. b, Intrinsic temperature rise relative to the device operating temperature extracted from the noise measurements (symbols), from the MC simulation (solid red line), and using an estimation using a phonon radiation analogy (dashed green line). Error bars are obtained by calculating the variations in intrinsic temperature rise due to the uncertainty in the noise measurements of Fig. 1. The theoretical and computational results are in good agreement with the measured intrinsic temperature rise, confirming that the phonon black-body radiation mechanism is responsible for the noise saturation.

Attributed to the following reasons: (1) both core and branch are pseudocapacitively active materials, (2) the special dendritic structure with considerable inter-nanowire space enables easy access of electrolyte to the core and branch surfaces, and (3) the highly conductive NiCo2S4 nanowire cores provide \u201csuperhighways\u201d for charge transition, NiCo2S4-cored dendritic heterojunction electrodes synergistically lead to ultrahigh specific capacitance, good rate capability, and excellent cycling life.

Its weak ferromagnetism arises from the canting of the antiferromagnetically aligned spins by the Dzyaloshinskii\u2013Moriya (DM) interaction6, 7, 8, 9. Prior theory considered the symmetry of the thermodynamic ground state and concluded that direct 180-degree switching of the DM vector by the ferroelectric polarization was forbidden10, 11. Instead, we examined the kinetics of the switching process, something not considered previously in theoretical work10, 11, 12. Here we show a deterministic reversal of the DM vector and canted moment using an electric field at room temperature. First-principles calculations reveal that the switching kinetics favours a two-step switching process. In each step the DM vector and polarization are coupled and 180-degree deterministic switching of magnetization hence becomes possible, in agreement with experimental observation. We exploit this switching to demonstrate energy-efficient control of a spin-valve device at room temperature. The energy per unit area required is approximately an order of magnitude less than that needed for spin-transfer torque switching13, 14. Given that the DM interaction is fundamental to single-phase multiferroics and magnetoelectrics3, 9, our results suggest ways to engineer magnetoelectric switching and tailor technologically pertinent functionality for nanometre-scale, low-energy-consumption, non-volatile magnetoelectronics.

Figure 3: Magnetization reversal by electric field. a, Schematic of a magnetoelectric device consisting of either Co0.9Fe0.1 or a Co0.9Fe0.1/Cu/Co0.9Fe0.1 spin valve on BiFeO3. Initial (b) and final (after 6 V) (c) directions of the in-plane Co0.9Fe0.1 moments with components viewed perpendicular (vertical KX-ray, where KX-ray defines the in-plane component of the incident X-ray beam) and parallel to the stripe domains (horizontal KX-ray). The directions of the magnetizations in each domain are highlighted with blue and red arrows, which correspond to the local moment direction being perpendicular or parallel to KX-ray. The net Co0.9Fe0.1 magnetization (green arrows) reverses after the voltage is applied. KX-ray images of the initial (d) and 6 V (e) states merged near the centre of the Co0.9Fe0.1 to reveal the magnetization reversal at each domain.

No consideration of the multidomain structure or the influence from an unswitched BiFeO3 matrix is given. a, The lowest-energy switching path calculated for a direct (one-step) 180° switch. A large energy separates the direct reversal of the polarization (black curve, top panel), described here as the Bi3+ shift (middle panel). The Bi3+ shift reverses following a trajectory directly through zero shift (that is, zero polarization). The O6-octahedral rotation (lower panel) remains unperturbed by the direct switch. Black, blue and red curves indicate orthogonal components (x1, x2, and x3) of Bi3+ displacement and O6-octahedral rotation in the reference cell. b, The lowest-energy switching path for polarization reversal calculated from all possible switching paths is a three-step sequence of sequential ferroelastic 71° switches. In this case the shift of the O6-octahedral rotation parallels the changes made by the polarization (Bi3+ displacement), leading to the reversal of the polarization, octahedral rotation and thus, the weak ferromagnetic moment of BiFeO3. Extended Data Fig. 4: Ab initio calculations of the Fe displacement in single- and two-step switching events. Fe3+ displacements for the single-step and two-step switching events shown in, and plotted with the data from, Fig. 2a. In each case, the Fe3+ shift mimics the Bi3+ shift; however, the Fe3+ shifts are smaller than those for Bi3+. a.u., arbitrary units. f.u., formula units. Extended Data Fig. 5: Domain configuration during switching process. A vector PFM image obtained partially through the switching process. Throughout the entire switching process, and in this image, (dark blue) domains only touch (orange) and (light blue) domains; the other polarization directions behave analogously. Scale bar is 500 nm. Extended Data Fig. 6: In-plane and out-of-plane PFM images of the boundary between switched and as-grown (initial) regions. The arrows indicate the in-plane and out-of-plane (inset) components of the polarizations. The domain walls across the boundary appear to be continuous, suggesting that the unswitched matrix (as-grown region) has an influence on the final polarization and domain states. Scale bar is 500 nm. Extended Data Fig. 7: Magnetic hysteresis curves from BiFeO3/Co0.9Fe0.1 (2.5 nm) and BiFeO3/SrTiO3 (1 nm)/Co0.9Fe0.1 (2.5 nm) heterostructures. a, Schematic of the BiFeO3/Co0.9Fe0.1 heterostructure with the directions of the net in-plane polarization (Pnet IP, the vector sum of the (001)p surface projections of the two polarization variants) and a 200 Oe magnetic field (Hgrowth) applied during the deposition of the Co0.9Fe0.1. The growth field was used to test the strength of the coupling to BiFeO3, given that the growth field should attempt to induce a uniaxial anisotropy in that direction. Magnetic hysteresis loops taken along different in-plane angles rotating from the direction of the growth field show that despite the growth field the easy axis is found to parallel the axis set by Pnet IP. b, Schematic of an experimental configuration similar to that in a; however, a 1-nm-thick layer of insulating and non-magnetic SrTiO3 has been deposited onto the BiFeO3 before the deposition of Co0.9Fe0.1. The magnetic loops from the BiFeO3/SrTiO3/Co0.9Fe0.1 heterostructure are plotted in blue and have a uniaxial anisotropy in the direction of the growth field (orthogonal to the axis set by Pnet IP) with reduced strength (lower saturation and switching fields) compared to those obtained from the BiFeO3/Co0.9Fe0.1 heterostructure in a (red curves). Extended Data Fig. 8: Null electric-field control of magnetism measurement on a BiFeO3/SrTiO3 (1 nm)/Co0.9Fe0.1 (2.5 nm) heterostructure. a, Anisotropic magnetoresistance obtained from the BiFeO3/SrTiO3/Co0.9Fe0.1 heterostructure taken at 20 Oe after the corresponding electric field was applied. No change in the phase of the anisotropic magnetoresistance curves was observed, indicating no switching of the magnetization. Extended Data Fig. 9: Description of the magnetoresistance in relation to the domain structure of the unpinned (not in contact with BiFeO3) and pinned (in contact with BiFeO3) Co0.9Fe0.1 layers. As the magnetic field is swept from positive to negative field (open purple circles) along the easy axis of the device the domain structure of the pinned layer evolves from single-domain to a stripe-like structure and back to single-domain. The numbers correlate to the schematics of the domain structures to the spin-valve resistance. At large, positive magnetic field the free and pinned layers are monodomain with magnetizations parallel (1, light blue box) and the device resistance is low. At low, positive magnetic field the pinned layer breaks up into two domain variants owing to the exchange coupling with BiFeO3 while the free layer remains largely monodomain (2, black box). Both net magnetizations are parallel but the device resistance increases due to domain formation in the pinned layer. The purple box (3) encloses the region of magnetic field where the unpinned layer breaks up into domains during switching and the device resistance increases rapidly. In box 4 (red) the net magnetizations of the two layers are antiparallel but not fully antiparallel as the pinned layer is broken into domains and the device resistance is high. At high, negative magnetic field the device is again in a low-resistance state and the two layers are monodomain with parallel magnetization. A similar evolution of the domain structure occurs as the magnetic field is increased from negative to positive values (open red circles).

Importantly, emerging data have also suggested that ribosome-associated cotranslational chaperones have active regulatory roles in modulating protein translation. By characterizing the structure of a type of eukaryotic cotranslational chaperone, the ribosome-associated complex (RAC) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that RAC cross-links two ribosomal subunits, through a single long α-helix, to limit the predominant intersubunit rotation required for peptide elongation. We further demonstrate that any changes in the continuity, length or rigidity of this middle α-helix impair RAC function in vivo. Our results suggest a new mechanism in which RAC directly regulates protein translation by mechanically coupling cotranslational folding with the peptide-elongation cycle, and they lay the foundation for further exploration of regulatory roles of RAC in translation control. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Structural characterization of the ribosome-\u200bZuotin interactions. (a,b) Cryo-EM density map of the 80S\u2013RAC complex in the nonrotated state, shown in two views. The 60S (cyan), 40S (yellow) and RAC (orange) are separately colored, with three ribosome-\u200bZuotin contacts (C1\u2013C3) indicated. The 4.9-Å density map was filtered to 6 Å to avoid possible overinterpretation. The segmented map of RAC is presented in a lower contour level, owing to substoichiometric binding of factors. (c,d) Two close-up views of the three ribosome-\u200bZuotin contacts. The ribosomal-component residues in direct contact with \u200bZuotin are highlighted in bright yellow in c and in gray in d. (e) Sequence and secondary-structural analysis of the charged region of \u200bZuotin. The charged region contains a predicted long α-helix (284\u2013364). The atomic structure of residues 348\u2013433 was previously determined (PDB 2LWX)21. Positively and negatively charged segments of \u200bZuotin (C2 and C3) involved in interaction with the ribosome are underlined in the sequence (positively charged in blue and negatively charged in red). (f) The partial atomic model of \u200bZuotin (284\u2013433), colored as in e and superimposed with the segmented density map of \u200bZuotin (from the data set RAC6). Figure 2: RAC stabilizes the 80S ribosome in a nonrotated conformation. (a,b) Cryo-EM density maps of nonrotated (a) and fully rotated (b) ribosomes bound with RAC. The two representative maps were selected from a large number of structures from 3D classification (RAC10 in Supplementary Table 1). (c) Superposition of the two density maps, with the nonrotated ribosome shown in transparent surface representation. The two maps were aligned with the 60S subunit as a reference. The CTD of \u200bZuotin could move up to 20 Å (arrow) upon a full ratchet-like motion. (d) A cartoon model showing the conformational changes of \u200bZuotin. \u200bZuotin appears to rotate around its 60S contacts upon motion of the 80S ribosome. (e) Conformational population analysis of the 80S ribosomes, showing RAC-dependent changes in the conformational dynamics of the ribosome. Distributions of particles from ten independent experimental data sets (with more than 90,000 particles; Supplementary Table 1) in different conformational states are plotted, according to 3D-classification results. Particles were grouped into five classes on the basis of the extent of 40S body-domain rotation, as indicated by the scale bar (0\u201311°). Empty 1 and 2 are two independent structural analyses of the 80S ribosome without addition of \u200bZuotin or RAC. Estimated relative factor occupancies in factor-containing reconstructions are indicated by black triangles. Figure 3: Integrity of the \u200bZuotin MD is essential for RAC function in vivo. (a) Cryo-EM structure of the 80S\u2013RAC complex (nonrotated state) in conventional front view, showing \u200bZuotin cross-linking of the 60S and 40S subunits through the MD. h44 of the 18S rRNA is colored magenta. (b) Schematic cartoons showing the design of plasmids encoding \u200bZuotin mutants. (c\u2013g) Spot assays showing impaired RAC function in vivo in response to changes in the continuity, length or rigidity of the \u200bZuotin MD. Cell-growth tests of the indicated Δ\u200bzuo, Δ316\u2013433 or wild-type (WT) strains transformed with the indicated YCplac111 vectors (under the endogenous \u200bZUO1 promoter) encoding full-length \u200bZuotin (\u200bZUO) or residues 316\u2013433 of \u200bZuotin (c); full-length or truncated \u200bZuotin as shown in b (\u200bZUO, 1\u2013315, 166\u2013433 and 316\u2013433) (d); progressive deletions of residues 316\u2013319, 316\u2013321 and 316\u2013323 in \u200bZuotin MD (del4, del6 and del8, respectively) (e); progressive insertions of sequences AKAE, AKAEAE and AKAEAEAK before residue A316 in \u200bZuotin MD (add4, add6 and add8, respectively) (f); or encoding \u200bglycine substitutions of sequences 316\u2013319, 316\u2013321 and 316\u2013323 in \u200bZuotin MD (gly4, gly6 and gly8, respectively) (g). Figure 4: Proposed model of RAC action on a translating ribosome. The emerging aggregation-prone peptide chain signals the ribosome to recruit RAC; RAC binding poses a constraint for intersubunit rotation and therefore reduces elongation rate (1). Ssb binds to aggregation-prone sequences in the ATP-bound state with help of RAC (2). Conformational changes of the \u200bZuotin NTD due to the ratchet-like motion of the 80S ribosome probably reorient \u200bZuotin's J domain to stimulate the ATPase activity of Ssb, thus resulting in high-affinity binding of Ssb\u2013ADP with substrates (3). Ssb in the ADP-bound state protects aggregation-prone sequences until productive folding can occur (4). Supplementary Fig. 1: Structural overview of the S. cerevisiae 80S ribosome bound with \u200bZuotin and \u200bSsz. (a-c) Cryo-EM density maps of the empty 80S (a), 80S-\u200bZuotin (b) and 80S-RAC (c) complexes are shown in surface representation, with view direction centered at the PTE (peptide tunnel exit) (a-d). The 60S, 40S, \u200bZuotin, and RAC are colored cyan, yellow, red and orange, respectively. NTD and CTD denote the N- and C-terminal domains of \u200bZuotin. (d) For the 80S-RAC map, densities of \u200bZuotin (red), \u200bSsz (purple) and ES27 (green) were segmented and separately colored. The two maps (b and c) were selected from a large number of similar structures (datasets \u200bZuo1 and RAC6, see Supplementary Table 1), based on their relatively high occupancy of RAC or \u200bZuotin on the ribosome. (e-h) Similar as (a-d), but displayed in a classical front view. (i and j) Overview (i) and close-up view (j) of the interaction of \u200bZuotin with \u200bSsz. The putative densities of \u200bSsz are colored transparent purple, with an atomic model of full-length \u200bSsz (see online methods) docked in its densities (cross-correlation coefficient 0.8329). The map is from the dataset RAC6 (Supplementary Table 1) and filtered to 12 Å. The fitting suggests that \u200bSsz-NTD directly interacts with \u200bZuotin-NTD, which is consistent with previous data that \u200bSsz-CTD does not stably associate with \u200bZuotin3 and is dispensable for its in vivo function4. Supplementary Fig. 2: Conformational dynamics of ES27 on the 80S ribosome. (a,d) Two distinct conformations of ES27 in the cryo-EM structures of the empty 80S ribosome. The two maps (filtered to 12 Å) are from the dataset of RAC1 (Supplementary Table 1). ES27, as an inherent dynamic component of the 25S rRNA, has two predominant states, with the helix stem toward the PTE (peptide tunnel exit) (a) or L1 stalk (d). (b,e) Two representative cryo-EM structures of the 80S-RAC complex, with ES27 in different conformations. The two maps (filtered to 10 Å) are from datasets RAC2 (b and c) and RAC11 (e and f). (c,f) Same as (b) and (e), with view directions centered at RAC. The 60S, 40S, RAC and ES27 are colored cyan, yellow, orange and green, respectively. ES27 is a dynamic rRNA helix, which can exist in sharply different conformations5, and has been proposed to have a possible role in regulating the binding of various co-translational factors at the PTE5-8. Our structural analysis shows that the RAC binding is independent of the conformational state of ES27, which suggests that ES27 might regulate the binding of Ssb (Supplementary Fig. 1), given the possible spatial relationship of ES27 and Ssb at the PTE. Supplementary Fig. 3: The workflow of the 3D image classification used in image processing. The schematic diagram of a cascade of 3D classification procedures based on RELION is shown (see online methods for full details). (1) 318,404 particles in the nonrotated state (from three datasets with relatively higher factor occupancy) were first combined and subjected to refinement, which resulted in a 4.9 Å map. (2) The particles were subjected to further 3D classification using RELION to remove those with slightly rotated 40S subunit, and only particles in -1.5 to -3.5 μm defocus range were kept. The resulting 167,534 particles rendered a 5.2 Å map after structural refinement. (3) To further improve the occupancy of factors, particles were subjected to a multiple reference classification (see online method) and split into two classes. (4) One class with higher occupancy of factors, with a number of 75,055 particles, was kept for another round of multiple reference classification. (5) The final 24,619 particles after two rounds of multiple reference classification (Step 3 and 4) were subjected to refinement, and a 7.2 Å map was obtained. The estimated resolutions were calculated according to the gold-standard FSC 0.143 criterion (Supplementary Fig. 6). Bfactor denotes the procedure of B-factor sharpening. The area outlined by pink lines is expected location of factor binding. Supplementary Fig. 4: Sequence analysis of \u200bZuotin MD and ES12. (a) Multiple sequence alignment of \u200bZuotin-MD. Residues are colored based on their sequence conservation. The secondary structure of \u200bZuotin-MD is also shown as a single long helix (red), with selected residue positions labeled with numbers and sequences involved in the 60S and 40S binding indicated by brackets. The numbering is based on S. cerevisiae. The sequence alignment was created using ClustalW2 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/). (b) Cartoon showing the length of ES12 in the corresponding species in (a). An evident observation is that the length of \u200bZuotin-MD correlates with the length of ES12, indicating a co-evolution pattern. Supplementary Fig. 5: Comparison of RAC and signal peptide\u2013recognition particle (SRP) on the 80S ribosome. (a,b) Overview (a) and closed-up view (b) of the cryo-EM map of the 80S-SRP complex (EMDB 1217)9. SB, stalk base; BK, beak; CP, central protuberance; H43 and H44, corresponding helices of the 25S rRNA; h5, h14 and h15, helices of the 18S rRNA; Alu, Alu domain of SRP. The 40S:SRP contact is indicated by a red circle. The map of the 80S-SRP complex is filtered to 10 Å. (c) Cryo-EM map of the 80S-RAC complex, showing in the same view as (a). RAC is colored orange and the 40S:RAC contact is indicated by a red circle. The map of the 80S-RAC complex is filtered to 10 Å (the dataset of RAC6). (d) Superimposition of (a) and (c), showing in a view centered at the PTE. RAC and SRP are apparently incompatible on the 80S ribosome. Supplementary Fig. 6: Local resolution maps and FSC curves of the three nonrotated 80S\u2013RAC density maps. (a-e, g-k, and m-q) Local resolution maps of the 4.9 Å (a-e), 5.2 Å (g-k) and 7.2 Å (m-q) density maps of the nonrotated 80S-RAC complex are colored according to the color scale on the right. The maps are displayed in classical front view (a-b, g-h and m-n) and a viewed centered on RAC (c-e, i-k, and o-q). Respective central slices of the local resolution maps are also shown (b, d, h, j, n, and p). Due to the substoichiometric binding and the flexibility of factors, local resolution maps are displayed at low contour levels (e, k and q), in order to show factor densities. As shown, with the increase of sample homogeneity (from e, k to q), local resolution at the factor region improves as well, although the overall resolution of the density maps becomes worse. (f, l and r) Gold-standard fourier shell correlation (FSC) curves of the three density maps. Videos Video 1: Cryo-EM structure of the yeast 80S\u2013RAC complex in 10.2-Å resolution. The density map is from the dataset RAC6, which has relatively highest occupancies for both Zuotin and Ssz. The map is displayed in surface representation with segmented parts separately colored. The movie shows the overall orientation of Zuotin and Ssz on the ribosome. Video 2: The 4.9-Å cryo-EM map of the yeast 80S\u2013RAC complex in nonrotated state. The density map is obtained by structural refinement of multiple datasets based on three-dimensional classification. The map shows the quality of the reconstruction. Due to substoichiometric binding and flexibility of factors, which results in fragmentation of factors in high-resolution structures, segmented map of RAC is presented in a lower contour level. After two rounds of RELION-based multiple-reference refinement, a 7.2 Å cryo-EM map of the yeast 80S-RAC complex in nonrotated state was obtained. Three ribosomal contacts (C1, C2 and C3) of RAC are shown, with five ribosomal components highlighted.

        "text": "Over the past few decades, two-dimensional (2D) and layered materials have emerged as new fields. Due to the zero-band-gap nature of graphene and the low photocatalytic performance of MoS2, more advanced semiconducting 2D materials have been prompted. As a result, semiconductor black phosphorus (BP) is a derived cutting-edge post-graphene contender for nanoelectrical application, because of its direct-band-gap nature. For the first time, we report on robust BP@TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts offering enhanced photocatalytic performance under light irradiation in environmental and biomedical fields, with negligible affected on temperature and pH conditions, as compared with MoS2@TiO2 prepared by the identical synthesis method. Remarkably, in contrast to pure few layered BP, which, due to its intrinsic sensitivity to oxygen and humidity was readily dissolved after just several uses, the BP@TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts showed a ~92% photocatalytic activity after 15 runs. Thus, metal-oxide-stabilized BP photocatalysts can be practically applied as a promising alternative to graphene and MoS2.

        "text": "Due to their excess surface free energy and structural instabilities, nanoparticles exhibit interesting physical and chemical properties. There has been an ever-growing interest in investigating these properties, driven by the desire to further miniaturize electronic devices, develop new functional materials and catalysts. Here, the intriguing question of how diffusion evolves in a single nanoparticle is investigated by measuring the spatial and temporal variations of the diffracted coherent X-ray intensity during copper diffusion into a gold nanocrystal. Dislocation loops formed from the insertion of single layer of extra atoms between neighbouring gold host lattice planes are detected. Au-Cu alloy channels are found to penetrate the nanocrystal due to the differential diffusion rate along different directions. With the advent of higher brilliance sources and free-electron-lasers, Bragg Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging can play an important role in unveiling atomic behaviours in three dimensions for nanomaterials during various fundamental processes.

        "text": "The physical modification of glass transition temperature (Tg) and properties of materials via blending is a common practice in industry and academia and has a large economic advantage. In this context, simple production of hitherto unattainable new inorganic glass blends from already existing glass compositions via blending raises much hope with the potential to provide new glasses with new and improved properties, that cannot be achieved with classical glass synthesis, for a plethora of applications such as computers screens, glass-to-metal seals, and storage materials for nuclear wastes. Here, we demonstrate that blends of the specific glass compositions studied are miscible in all proportions, an unreported phenomenon in hard condensed matter like glass. Interestingly, excellent agreement was found between the obtained data and calculated Tgs from theoretical equations (Supplementary information) for predicting the composition dependence of Tg for miscible blends with weak but significant specific interactions between the blend components. That this blending method is at present not applied to inorganic glasses reflects the fact that water and chemically resistant phosphate glasses with relatively low Tgs have become available only recently.

        "text": "The transport properties of films assembled from metal nanoclusters can be significantly different from the metals in their bulk or thin film forms due to quantum confinement effects and several competing energy and length scales. For a film composed of metal nanoclusters as its building blocks, the cluster size and the inter-cluster separation are parameters that can be varied experimentally. Here we show that the electrical conductivity of a film composed of silver nanoclusters can be changed by 9 orders of magnitude as a function of the average inter-cluster separation while keeping the average cluster size same. For inter-cluster separations of 9 nanometres or more the conductivity is insulating type whereas for lesser inter-cluster separations the conductivity behaviour is metallic type with a positive temperature coefficient of resistance. In the intermediate range between the two regions, a very interesting temperature-independent conductivity is seen. Our work provides a new paradigm for design of artificial solid structures composed of nanoclusters. The properties of these nanostructures could be tuned by varying the inter-cluster distances to get the desired properties in the same material.

The value of sericin for tissue engineering is underestimated and its potential application in regenerative medicine has just begun to be explored. Here we report the successful fabrication and characterization of a covalently-crosslinked 3D pure sericin hydrogel for delivery of cells and drugs. This hydrogel is injectable, permitting its implantation through minimally invasive approaches. Notably, this hydrogel is found to exhibit photoluminescence, enabling bioimaging and in vivo tracking. Moreover, this hydrogel system possesses excellent cell-adhesive capability, effectively promoting cell attachment, proliferation and long-term survival of various types of cells. Further, the sericin hydrogel releases bioactive reagents in a sustained manner. Additionally, this hydrogel demonstrates good elasticity, high porosity, and pH-dependent degradation dynamics, which are advantageous for this sericin hydrogel to serve as a delivery vehicle for cells and therapeutic drugs. With all these unique features, it is expected that this sericin hydrogel will have wide utility in the areas of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information The ability to advance our understanding of multiple exciton generation (MEG) in organic materials has been restricted by the limited number of materials capable of singlet fission. A particular challenge is the development of materials that undergo efficient intramolecular fission, such that local order and strong nearest-neighbour coupling is no longer a design constraint. Here we address these challenges by demonstrating that strong intrachain donor\u2013acceptor interactions are a key design feature for organic materials capable of intramolecular singlet fission. By conjugating strong-acceptor and strong-donor building blocks, small molecules and polymers with charge-transfer states that mediate population transfer between singlet excitons and triplet excitons are synthesized. Using transient optical techniques, we show that triplet populations can be generated with yields up to 170%. These guidelines are widely applicable to similar families of polymers and small molecules, and can lead to the development of new fission-capable materials with tunable electronic structure, as well as a deeper fundamental understanding of MEG. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Design template for singlet-fission-capable molecular and polymeric materials. a, The mechanism for singlet fission: a singlet exciton (S1) is strongly coupled to a charge-transfer (CT) state, which is in turn strongly coupled to the multiexcitonic triplet state (ME). This charge-transfer mediated process strongly couples the S1 and ME states, whereas the direct S1-to-ME coupling is very weak28, 29. b, Fundamental design for charge-transfer-mediated intramolecular singlet fission using strong-donor (SD) and strong-acceptor (SA) units. Singlet excited states can be viewed as a linear combination of intramolecular CT states (denoted as singlet excitons with partial positive (δ+) and negative (δ−) charges on the donor and acceptor, respectively), which mediate the population of localized triplet states (T1) within the SA units through singlet fission. Figure 2: Structures and absorption spectra of singlet-fission-exhibiting and control materials. a, Singlet fission small molecules and polymers (n = 1,2). The strong electron acceptor units based on \u200bTDO are shown in red and the donor units are shown in blue. b, Control small molecule and polymer without SA units. c, Absorption spectra of the molecules and polymers. Unoxidized materials are shown for reference. See the Supplementary Information for detailed structures with solubilizing groups, which are here omitted for clarity. Figure 3: Transient absorption data and global analysis for PBTDO1. a, Transient absorption of PBTDO1 is shown in a pseudo-colour plot with singlet/charge-transfer exciton (Sbright/CT) and triplet exciton (T1) features denoted. b, The dynamics are shown with kinetic traces (open circles) and fits (solid lines) taken through the singlet (>750 nm) and triplet (700\u2013725 nm) absorption features in spectral regions with minimal overlap with other spectral features. c,d, Global analysis was used to model singlet charge-transfer exciton, triplet and charge-separated (CS) populations to extract time independent spectral signatures (c) and population concentration versus time (d). a\u2013c are plotted in the unit-less quantity ΔOD or ΔmOD, the change in optical density or parts-per-thousand change in optical density, respectively. Details of the global analysis and concentration calculation are given in the Methods and Supplementary Information. In c, data has been excised in the regions obscured by excitation and fundamental scatter, around 550 nm and 800 nm, respectively. Raw transient absorption data are plotted in Supplementary Fig. 9. Figure 4: TA and PRTT for all \u200bTDO-containing materials. a,b, The triplet spectra are compared in TDO1- (a) and TDO2-containing (b) molecules and polymers. The spectra of triplets generated from singlet fission (solid lines) are compared against triplets generated through pulse radiolysis (circles). SF-generated spectral traces are from TA data sets; global target analysis40, 41 was used to extract the triplet spectrum when the triplet had significant temporal overlap with other populations (details in the Methods). Note that, because the triplet is localized on the \u200bTDO moieties, the triplet spectrum is equivalent for all materials containing the same number of sequential \u200bTDO monomers (aside from the contribution of the overlapping bleach band). c,d, Recombination of triplet pairs generated from singlet fission is compared against recombination of lone triplets generated through pulse radiolysis (black traces) in TDO1- (c) and TDO2-containing (d) molecules and polymers. The time axes of the pulse radiolysis traces have been offset to exclude the population growth and emphasize the triplet decay. Note that the logarithmic axis highlights several orders of magnitude difference in the triplet and triplet pair recombination lifetimes. In panels a and b, transient absorption data has been excised from regions obscured by laser scatter. Raw transient absorption data are plotted in Supplementary Fig. 9.

        "text": "ZnO and TiOx are commonly used as electron extraction layers (EELs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). A general phenomenon of OSCs incorporating these metal-oxides is the requirement to illuminate the devices with UV light in order to improve device characteristics. This may cause severe problems if UV to VIS down-conversion is applied or if the UV spectral range (λ < 400 nm) is blocked to achieve an improved device lifetime. In this work, silver nanoparticles (AgNP) are used to plasmonically sensitize metal-oxide based EELs in the vicinity (1\u201320 nm) of the metal-oxide/organic interface. We evidence that plasmonically sensitized metal-oxide layers facilitate electron extraction and afford well-behaved highly efficient OSCs, even without the typical requirement of UV exposure. It is shown that in the plasmonically sensitized metal-oxides the illumination with visible light lowers the WF due to desorption of previously ionosorbed oxygen, in analogy to the process found in neat metal oxides upon UV exposure, only. As underlying mechanism the transfer of hot holes from the metal to the oxide upon illumination with hν < Eg is verified. The general applicability of this concept to most common metal-oxides (e.g. TiOx and ZnO) in combination with different photoactive organic materials is demonstrated.

        "text": "We propose an all-optical integrated nonreciprocal device on the optomechanical platform with a large nonreciprocal bandwidth and low operating power. The device is based on an asymmetric silicon coupler consisting of two branches. One of them is a conventional strip waveguide fixed on the substrate, and the other is a freestanding nanostring suspended above a groove in the substrate. When light is launched into the coupler, the optical gradient force between the freestanding nanostring and the underlying substrate leads to the deflection of the nanostring, and finally results in destruction of the initial phase-matching condition between the two branches. The suspended branch would achieve distinct deflections when light is incident from different ports. The simulation results show a nonreciprocal bandwidth of 13.1 nm with operating power of 390 μW. With the advantages of simple structure, low power consumption and large operating bandwidth, our work provides a promising solution for on-chip passive nonreciprocal device.

        "text": "Frictional interfaces abound in natural and man-made systems, yet their dynamics are not well-understood. Recent extensive experimental data have revealed that velocity-strengthening friction, where the steady-state frictional resistance increases with sliding velocity over some range, is a generic feature of such interfaces. This physical behavior has very recently been linked to slow stick-slip motion. Here we elucidate the importance of velocity-strengthening friction by theoretically studying three variants of a realistic friction model, all featuring identical logarithmic velocity-weakening friction at small sliding velocities, but differ in their higher velocity behaviors. By quantifying energy partition (e.g. radiation and dissipation), the selection of interfacial rupture fronts and rupture arrest, we show that the presence or absence of strengthening significantly affects the global interfacial resistance and the energy release during frictional instabilities. Furthermore, we show that different forms of strengthening may result in events of similar magnitude, yet with dramatically different dissipation and radiation rates. This happens because the events are mediated by rupture fronts with vastly different propagation velocities, where stronger velocity-strengthening friction promotes slower rupture. These theoretical results may have significant implications on our understanding of frictional dynamics. Subject terms: Coarse-grained models\u2022 Surfaces, interfaces and thin films At a glance Figures View all figures Figure 1: The steady sliding friction coefficient τss/σ vs. the slip velocity for the three model variants (different colors, also marked by labels). Note that all of the curves coincide at low velocities and that the driving velocity vd is marked. Full size image View in article Figure 2: A sketch of the spatially-extended frictional system. An elastic block, which is in frictional contact with a rigid substrate, is loaded by a space- and time-independent normal stress σyy(x, y = H, t) = σ (H is the block's height) and driven by a velocity vd at its trailing edge (x = 0). The leading edge is at x = L. The shear stress at the interface, σxy(x, y = 0, t), is equal to the frictional stress τ(x, t). Full size image View in article Figure 3: The loading force fd vs. time for the three models (color code as in Fig. 1). It is seen that all of the curves coincide for short times, and then begin to diverge. The LS and STL models maintain the same \u201cenvelope\u201d, while the PW model features more pronounced stress drops, larger inter-event times and a lower overall resistance.

Here, we present a first-principles design on their magnetic and electronic switching controlled by tension. We find that hydrogenated VTe2 monolayer experiences a transfer from anti-ferromagnetism to ferromagnetism via a turning-point of paramagnetism, and switches from semiconductor, to metal, further to half-metal as tension increases. We show that its anti-ferromagnetism with semiconducting or metallic character under low tension is contributed to super-exchange or mobile-carrier enhanced super-exchange, while the ferromagnetism with half-metallic character under high tension is induced by carrier-mediated double exchange. We further show that the magnetic and electronic evolutions of hydrogenated VS2 and VSe2 monolayers under tension follow the same trend as those of hydrogenated VTe2 monolayer. We predict that tension is efficient and simple to control the magnetic and electronic properties of hydrogenated vanadium dichalcogenides monolayers.

Both structures with 1:1 stoichiometry are found to be energetically more favorable than solid acetylene and cubane, and even more stable than benzene II solid at high pressure. The calculations on vibrational, electronic, and optical properties reveal that the new chiral hydrocarbons are dynamically stable with large bulk moduli around 200 GPa, and exhibit a transparent insulating behavior with indirect band gaps of 5.9 ~ 6.7 eV and anisotropic adsorption spectra. Such forms of hydrocarbon, once synthesized, would have wide applications in mechanical, optoelectronic, and biological materials.

In agreement with the theoretical prediction, the emission pattern of dye on top of lamellar metamaterial is similar to that on top of metal. At the same time, the effective medium model predicts the emission patterns of the nanowire array and the dye film deposited on glass to be nearly identical to each other.

        "text": "Einstein predicted that clocks at different altitudes tick at various rates under the influence of gravity. This effect has been observed using 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy over an elevation of 22.5 m (ref. 1) or by comparing accurate optical clocks at different heights on a submetre scale2. However, challenges remain in finding novel methods for the detection of gravitational and relativistic effects on more compact scales. Here, we investigate a scheme that potentially allows for millimetre- to submillimetre-scale studies of the gravitational redshift by probing a nuclear crystal with X-rays. Also, a rotating crystal can force interacting X-rays to experience inhomogeneous clock tick rates within it. We find that an association of gravitational redshift and special-relativistic time dilation with quantum interference is manifested by a time-dependent deflection of X-rays. The scheme suggests a table-top solution for probing gravitational and special-relativistic effects, which should be within the reach of current experimental technology3, 4, 5. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Superradiant single photon. a, An incident single photon with wavevector is absorbed and shared by an ensemble of two-level quantum particles. Without knowing which one is excited, a collective excitation, which is a superposition of all possibilities, will form. The decay of such a delocalized collective excitation will be followed by directional emission of a single photon along the incident . This coherently reemitted photon is called a superradiant single photon. Yellow and red dots illustrate particles in the ground and excited states, respectively, and red arrows depict both the incident and the reemitted single photon. b, A collective excitation is created in a collection of two-level particles while a particle is excited from its ground level to a higher energy level by absorbing a single photon with wavevector . c, A superradiant single photon is deflected by a gradient perturbation depicted by the brown upward arrow. φ is the deflection angle between the incident wavevector and deflected wavevector . Figure 2: Gravitational deflection of X-ray superradiance. a, Earth's gravity deflects the superradiant single X-ray photon from its incident direction with time-dependent angle φg. The green cuboid depicts a fixed nuclear crystal in the gravitational field of the Earth, the red and blue arrows represents the incident and reemitted single photon, respectively, and yellow horizontal bars illustrate the count numbers at different positions of a position-sensitive detector. b, Influence of gravity on proper time. Clocks closer to the Earth run slower. The same happens to fixed nuclei (yellow dots) in a crystal (depicted by the green rectangle). Earth, crystal size and clock ticks are not in scale. Figure 3: X-ray superradiance under the influence of special relativity. a, X-ray photon deflection by time dilation of special relativity, where the crystal (green cuboid) is attached to a rotor with radius R and is subject to rotation with angular frequency Λ. Under the influence of inhomogeneous relativistic time dilation, the incident single X-ray photon (red arrow) is bent along the blue arrow with a time-dependent angle φC and time-dependent reemission probability (yellow bars on the position-sensitive detector). The red circle on the detector illustrates the trajectory of the registered signals without considering the inhomogeneous relativistic time dilation. b, According to the time dilation effect, the tick rate of the proper time of each nucleus at different radii, r, depends on the local velocity, , within a crystal. Also, green arrows illustrate local velocities of nuclei (yellow dots) at different sites of a rotating crystal (green rectangle).

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information DNA and DNA-based polymers are of interest in molecular electronics because of their versatile and programmable structures. However, transport measurements have produced a range of seemingly contradictory results due to differences in the measured molecules and experimental set-ups, and transporting significant current through individual DNA-based molecules remains a considerable challenge. Here, we report reproducible charge transport in guanine-quadruplex (G4) DNA molecules adsorbed on a mica substrate. Currents ranging from tens of picoamperes to more than 100 pA were measured in the G4-DNA over distances ranging from tens of nanometres to more than 100 nm. Our experimental results, combined with theoretical modelling, suggest that transport occurs via a thermally activated long-range hopping between multi-tetrad segments of DNA. These results could re-ignite interest in DNA-based wires and devices, and in the use of such systems in the development of programmable circuits.

        "text": "Charge noise is critical in the performance of gate-controlled quantum dots (QDs). Such information is not yet available for QDs made out of the new material graphene, where both substrate and edge states are known to have important effects. Here we show the 1/f noise for a microscopic graphene QD is substantially larger than that for a macroscopic graphene field-effect transistor (FET), increasing linearly with temperature. To understand its origin, we suspended the graphene QD above the substrate. In contrast to large area graphene FETs, we find that a suspended graphene QD has an almost-identical noise level as an unsuspended one. Tracking noise levels around the Coulomb blockade peak as a function of gate voltage yields potential fluctuations of order 1 μeV, almost one order larger than in GaAs/GaAlAs QDs. Edge states and surface impurities rather than substrate-induced disorders, appear to dominate the 1/f noise, thus affecting the coherency of graphene nano-devices.

Herein, a micelle-template strategy to prepare porous graphene materials with controllable mesopores, high specific surface areas and large pore volumes is reported. By fine-tuning the synthesis parameters, the pore sizes of mesoporous graphene can be rationally controlled. Nitrogen heteroatom doping is found to remarkably render electrocatalytic properties towards hydrogen evolution reactions as a highly efficient metal-free catalyst. The synthesis strategy and the demonstration of highly efficient catalytic effect provide benchmarks for preparing well-defined mesoporous graphene materials for energy production applications.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of using two different CABP-HAs, poly (1,8-octanediol citrate)-click-HA (POC-Click-HA) and crosslinked urethane-doped polyester-HA (CUPE-HA) as an alternative to autologous tissue grafts in the repair of skeletal defects. CABP-HA disc-shaped scaffolds (65 wt.-% HA with 70% porosity) were used as bare implants without the addition of growth factors or cells to renovate 4 mm diameter rat calvarial defects (n = 72, n = 18 per group). Defects were either left empty (negative control group), or treated with CUPE-HA scaffolds, POC-Click-HA scaffolds, or autologous bone grafts (AB group). Radiological and histological data showed a significant enhancement of osteogenesis in defects treated with CUPE-HA scaffolds when compared to POC-Click-HA scaffolds. Both, POC-Click-HA and CUPE-HA scaffolds, resulted in enhanced bone mineral density, trabecular thickness, and angiogenesis when compared to the control groups at 1, 3, and 6 months post-trauma. These results show the potential of CABP-HA bare implants as biocompatible, osteogenic, and off-shelf-available options in the repair of orthopedic defects.

Here, by using in situ synchrotron X-ray scattering, we show that in the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of \u200bAu on \u200bPt or Pt-alloy seeds the heteroepitaxial growth of the \u200bAu shell exerts high stress (∼2 GPa) on the seed by forming a core/shell structure in the early stage of the reaction. The development of lattice strain and subsequent strain relaxation, which we show using atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy to occur through the slip of {111} layers, induces morphological changes from a core/shell to a dumbbell structure, and governs the nucleation and growth kinetics. We also propose a thermodynamic model for the nucleation and growth of dumbbell metallic heteronanostructures.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information With hydrogen being seen as a key renewable energy vector, the search for materials exhibiting fast hydrogen transport becomes ever more important. Not only do hydrogen storage materials require high mobility of hydrogen in the solid state, but the efficiency of electrochemical devices is also largely determined by fast ionic transport. Although the heavy alkaline-earth hydrides are of limited interest for their hydrogen storage potential, owing to low gravimetric densities, their ionic nature may prove useful in new electrochemical applications, especially as an ionically conducting electrolyte material. Here we show that \u200bbarium hydride shows fast pure ionic transport of hydride ions (H−) in the high-temperature, high-symmetry phase. Although some conductivity studies have been reported on related materials previously, the nature of the charge carriers has not been determined. \u200bBaH2 gives rise to hydride ion conductivity of 0.2 S cm−1 at 630 °C. This is an order of magnitude larger than that of state-of-the-art proton-conducting perovskites or oxide ion conductors at this temperature. These results suggest that the alkaline-earth hydrides form an important new family of materials, with potential use in a number of applications, such as separation membranes, electrochemical reactors and so on.

        "text": "Most of the atomistic modeling of semicoherent metal-metal interfaces has so far been based on the use of semiempirical interatomic potentials. We show that key conclusions drawn from previous studies are in contradiction with more precise ab-initio calculations. In particular we find that single point defects do not delocalize, but remain compact near the interfacial plane in Cu-Nb multilayers. We give a simple qualitative explanation for this difference on the basis of the well known limited transferability of empirical potentials.

        "text": "We report a method to improve the performance of polycrystalline Si (poly-Si) thin-film transistors (TFTs) via pressure-induced nucleation (PIN). During the PIN process, spatial variation in the local solidification temperature occurs because of a non-uniform pressure distribution during laser irradiation of the amorphous Si layer, which is capped with an SiO2 layer. This leads to a four-fold increase in the grain size of the poly-Si thin-films formed using the PIN process, compared with those formed using conventional excimer laser annealing. We find that thin films with optimal electrical properties can be achieved with a reduction in the number of laser irradiations from 20 to 6, as well as the preservation of the interface between the poly-Si and the SiO2 gate insulator. This interface preservation becomes possible to remove the cleaning process prior to gate insulator deposition, and we report devices with a field-effect mobility greater than 160 cm2/Vs.

Herein, a highly active and stable nonmetallic electrocatalyst, nitrogen doped hexagonal carbon (NHC), was developed for hydrogen production.

Due to the complex structure and chemistry of CSH at various length scales, the focus has progressively turned towards its atomic level comprehension. We study electronic structure and bonding of a large subset of the known CSH minerals. Our results reveal a wide range of contributions from each type of bonding, especially hydrogen bonding, which should enable critical analysis of spectroscopic measurements and construction of realistic C-S-H models. We find the total bond order density (TBOD) as the ideal overall metric for assessing crystal cohesion of these complex materials and should replace conventional measures such as Ca:Si ratio.

        "text": "Perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) have been considered one of the competitive next generation power sources. To date, light-to-electric conversion efficiencies have rapidly increased to over 10%, and further improvements are expected. However, the poor device reproducibility of PeSCs ascribed to their inhomogeneously covered film morphology has hindered their practical application. Here, we demonstrate high-performance PeSCs with superior reproducibility by introducing small amounts of N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone (CHP) as a morphology controller into N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). As a result, highly homogeneous film morphology, similar to that achieved by vacuum-deposition methods, as well as a high PCE of 10% and an extremely small performance deviation within 0.14% were achieved. This study represents a method for realizing efficient and reproducible planar heterojunction (PHJ) PeSCs through morphology control, taking a major step forward in the low-cost and rapid production of PeSCs by solving one of the biggest problems of PHJ perovskite photovoltaic technology through a facile method.

        "text": "Molecular nanomagnets are attractive candidate qubits because of their wide inter- and intra-molecular tunability. Uniform magnetic pulses could be exploited to implement one- and two-qubit gates in presence of a properly engineered pattern of interactions, but the synthesis of suitable and potentially scalable supramolecular complexes has proven a very hard task. Indeed, no quantum algorithms have ever been implemented, not even a proof-of-principle two-qubit gate. Here we show that the magnetic couplings in two supramolecular {Cr7Ni}-Ni-{Cr7Ni} assemblies can be chemically engineered to fit the above requisites for conditional gates with no need of local control. Microscopic parameters are determined by a recently developed many-body ab-initio approach and used to simulate quantum gates. We find that these systems are optimal for proof-of-principle two-qubit experiments and can be exploited as building blocks of scalable architectures for quantum simulation.

        "text": "Nano-graphene oxide (nano-GO) is a new class of carbon based materials being proposed for biomedical applications due to its small size, intrinsic optical properties, large specific surface area, and easy to functionalize. To fully exploit nano-GO properties, a reproducible method for its production is of utmost importance. Herein we report, the study of the sequential fracture of GO sheets onto nano-GO with controllable lateral width, by a simple, and reproducible method based on a mechanism that we describe as a confined hot spot atomic fragmentation/reduction of GO promoted by ultrasonication. The chemical and structural changes on GO structure during the breakage were monitored by XPS, FTIR, Raman and HRTEM. We found that GO sheets starts breaking from the defects region and in a second phase through the disruption of carbon bonds while still maintaining crystalline carbon domains. The breaking of GO is accompanied by its own reduction, essentially by the elimination of carboxylic and carbonyl functional groups. Photoluminescence and photothermal studies using this nano-GO are also presented highlighting the potential of this nanomaterial as a unique imaging/therapy platform.

The effect of HP temperatures (850\u2013925°C) on the c-axis texture, resistivity, Vickers micro-hardness, microstructure and critical current properties has been systematically studied. Taking advantage of high degree of c-axis texture, well grain connectivity and large concentration of strong-pinning defects, we are able to obtain an excellent Jc of 1.2 × 105 A/cm2 at 4.2 K and 10 T for Sr-122 tapes. More importantly, the field dependence of Jc turns out to be very weak, such that in 14 T the Jc still remains ~ 1.0 × 105 A/cm2. These Jc values are the highest ever reported so far for iron-pnictide wires and tapes, achieving the level desired for practical applications. Our results clearly strengthen the position of iron-pnictide conductors as a competitor to the conventional and MgB2 superconductors for high field applications.

        "text": "Nanoindentation has been recently used to measure the mechanical properties of polycrystalline graphene. However, the measured failure loads are found to be scattered widely and vary from lab to lab. We perform molecular dynamics simulations of nanoindentation on polycrystalline graphene at different sites including grain center, grain boundary (GB), GB triple junction, and holes. Depending on the relative position between the indenter tip and defects, significant scattering in failure load is observed. This scattering is found to arise from a combination of the non-uniform stress state, varied and weakened strengths of different defects, and the relative location between the indenter tip and the defects in polycrystalline graphene. Consequently, the failure behavior of polycrystalline graphene by nanoindentation is critically dependent on the indentation site, and is thus distinct from uniaxial tensile loading. Our work highlights the importance of the interaction between the indentation tip and defects, and the need to explicitly consider the defect characteristics at and near the indentation site in polycrystalline graphene during nanoindentation.

The color indicates the von Mises stress. (b) The normal load vs. indentation depth curves. The dotted line represents the indentation result without a hole. It is seen that the relative position between the indenter tip and the hole gives rise to the large difference in failure load.

The dotted circles indicate the initial crack formation. The close-up views of these crack formations are shown in the right panels. For clarity, the indenter tip is not shown. The rupture of polycrystalline graphene starts from a GB when the indenter tip is positioned on the center of grain, while the rupture of polycrystalline graphene starts directly from a defect when the indenter tip is positioned on the defect.

We study graphene on Ir, with Pb monolayer islands intercalated between the graphene sheet and the Ir surface. Although the graphene layer is structurally unaffected by the presence of the Pb islands, its electronic properties change markedly, with regularly spaced resonances appearing. We interpret these resonances as the effect of a strong and spatially modulated spin\u2013orbit coupling, induced in graphene by the Pb monolayer. As well as confined electronic states, the electronic spectrum has a series of gaps with non-trivial topological properties, resembling a realization of the quantum spin Hall effect proposed by Bernevig and Zhang4. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Structure of Pb-intercalated graphene. a, Large-scale STM image (470 × 90 nm2) of gr/Ir(111) after deposition of Pb at 800 K. The image has been taken at 80 K. There are areas intercalated with Pb close to the steps and intercalated islands in the middle of the terraces, often associated with the presence of wrinkles (white areas) in pristine gr/Ir(111). The intercalated areas are indicated by the beige shaded regions, as opposed to the blue tint given to the non-intercalated regions, for an easier identification. b, Atomically resolved STM image (28 × 13 nm2) acquired across the border between gr/Pb/Ir(111) (left) and gr/Ir(111) (right) in a region similar to the one marked by the purple rectangle in a, taken at 4.6 K. The relevant unit cells on the intercalated and non-intercalated regions are highlighted in black and white, respectively. c, Height profile along the black line in the image shown in b. d, Schematic model of the atomic arrangement obtained by STM and LEED: grey and yellow circles represent Ir and Pb atoms respectively. Black filled and open circles represent the two graphene sublattices. The unit cells of moiré, Pb-intercalated layer and graphene are shown in green (half of the unit cell), red and blue respectively. Notice that the Pb and Ir(111) lattices are commensurate. Figure 2: STS in a Pb-intercalated graphene island. Differential conductance spectrum recorded at 4.6 K on the centre of the 10-nm-wide gr/Pb/Ir(111) island shown in the inset.

In all cases, the lock-in signal is plotted on a logarithmic scale for an easier visualization of the peaks. a.u., arbitrary units. d, Energy positions of the peaks as a function of the quantum number. The error bars correspond to the full-width at half-maximum of the corresponding peaks that appear in c. Figure 4: Spatial variation of the spin\u2013orbit coupling and calculated local density of states. a, Spatial evolution of the S\u2013O coupling across the border of the Pb-intercalated regions. The non-uniform S\u2013O profile follows an error function spread over 60 unit cells of graphene along the armchair direction. The inset shows schematically a Pb island with its physical edge in black, and the in-plane spin-polarized counter-propagating modes expected at the edges of the region where the S\u2013O changes between Pb islands. The colour of the arrows indicates opposite in-plane spin polarizations. b, LDOS calculated for gr/Ir(111). A non-uniform S\u2013O coupling with a maximum strength of λmax = 0.5t is assumed. The parameters correspond to Ax = 2λ(y)/at, Ay = 0 and we assume (≈0.3 eV), where t is the first-neighbour hopping parameter of graphene (3 eV) and a is the distance between carbon atoms.

We report a synthetic strategy to fabricate metal nanomaterials with highly ordered, tunable mesostructures in confined systems based on a new quasi-hard-templating liquid-crystals mechanism. The resulting platinum nanowires exhibit long range two-dimensional hexagonally ordered mesopore structures. In addition, single crystalline hexagonal mesoporous platinum nanowires with dominant {110} facets have been synthesized.

        "text": "Previous stochastic localization-based super-resolution techniques are largely limited by the labeling density and the fidelity to the morphology of specimen. We report on an optical super-resolution imaging scheme implementing joint tagging using multiple fluorescent blinking dyes associated with super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (JT-SOFI), achieving ultra-high labeling density super-resolution imaging. To demonstrate the feasibility of JT-SOFI, quantum dots with different emission spectra were jointly labeled to the tubulin in COS7 cells, creating ultra-high density labeling. After analyzing and combining the fluorescence intermittency images emanating from spectrally resolved quantum dots, the microtubule networks are capable of being investigated with high fidelity and remarkably enhanced contrast at sub-diffraction resolution. The spectral separation also significantly decreased the frame number required for SOFI, enabling fast super-resolution microscopy through simultaneous data acquisition. As the joint-tagging scheme can decrease the labeling density in each spectral channel, thereby bring it closer to single-molecule state, we can faithfully reconstruct the continuous microtubule structure with high resolution through collection of only 100 frames per channel. The improved continuity of the microtubule structure is quantitatively validated with image skeletonization, thus demonstrating the advantage of JT-SOFI over other localization-based super-resolution methods.

This interest has arisen because it is a maximally thin membrane that, once perforated with atomic accuracy, may allow ultrafast and highly selective sieving of gases, liquids, dissolved ions and other species of interest2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. However, a perfect graphene monolayer is impermeable to all atoms and molecules under ambient conditions1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7: even hydrogen, the smallest of atoms, is expected to take billions of years to penetrate graphene\u2019s dense electronic cloud3, 4, 5, 6. Only accelerated atoms possess the kinetic energy required to do this20, 21. The same behaviour might reasonably be expected in the case of other atomically thin crystals22, 23. Here we report transport and mass spectroscopy measurements which establish that monolayers of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are highly permeable to thermal protons under ambient conditions, whereas no proton transport is detected for thicker crystals such as monolayer molybdenum disulphide, bilayer graphene or multilayer hBN. Protons present an intermediate case between electrons (which can tunnel easily through atomically thin barriers24) and atoms, yet our measured transport rates are unexpectedly high4, 5 and raise fundamental questions about the details of the transport process. We see the highest room-temperature proton conductivity with monolayer hBN, for which we measure a resistivity to proton flow of about 10 Ω cm2 and a low activation energy of about 0.3 electronvolts. At higher temperatures, hBN is outperformed by graphene, the resistivity of which is estimated to fall below 10−3 Ω cm2 above 250 degrees Celsius. Proton transport can be further enhanced by decorating the graphene and hBN membranes with catalytic metal nanoparticles. The high, selective proton conductivity and stability make one-atom-thick crystals promising candidates for use in many hydrogen-based technologies.

        "text": "ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters translocate substrates across cell membranes, using energy harnessed from ATP binding and hydrolysis at their nucleotide-binding domains1, 2. ABC exporters are present both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, with examples implicated in multidrug resistance of pathogens and cancer cells, as well as in many human diseases3, 4. TmrAB is a heterodimeric ABC exporter from the thermophilic Gram-negative eubacterium Thermus thermophilus; it is homologous to various multidrug transporters and contains one degenerate site with a non-catalytic residue next to the Walker B motif5. Here we report a subnanometre-resolution structure of detergent-solubilized TmrAB in a nucleotide-free, inward-facing conformation by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. The reconstructions clearly resolve characteristic features of ABC transporters, including helices in the transmembrane domain and nucleotide-binding domains. A cavity in the transmembrane domain is accessible laterally from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane as well as from the cytoplasm, indicating that the transporter lies in an inward-facing open conformation. The two nucleotide-binding domains remain in contact via their carboxy-terminal helices. Furthermore, comparison between our structure and the crystal structures of other ABC transporters suggests a possible trajectory of conformational changes that involves a sliding and rotating motion between the two nucleotide-binding domains during the transition from the inward-facing to outward-facing conformations.

AD12\u2013myc binding was not affected by the presence of AH5\u2013Flag or DH5\u2013Flag (top left). AH5\u2013Flag and DH5\u2013Flag maintained near-maximum binding (*) at all AD12\u2013myc concentrations (top right). AD12\u2013myc binding was almost abolished in the presence of AD12\u2013Flag or BA6\u2013Flag (middle left). AD12\u2013Flag and BA6\u2013Flag maintained near-maximum binding (*) at all AD12\u2013myc concentrations (middle right).

Uninhibited binding of AD12\u2013myc and Fab\u2013Flag suggests independent binding between AD12 and AH5 or DH5. Inhibited binding of either AD12\u2013myc or Fab\u2013Flag suggests overlapping epitopes between AD12 and BA6 or AH11. c, Representative negative-stain two-dimensional class averages of TmrAB\u2013Fab complexes. d, Immunoblotting of TmrAB, using Fab\u2013Flag.

The map shows two NBDs, a bi-lobed DDM micelle, which is separated by TM4 (marked by two dotted lines in the top view), and well-defined AH5 density. In the bottom view, two parallel solid lines and dotted lines indicate orientations of the front and back halves of the micelle respectively. The two halves are tilted by ~30° with respect to each other. b, The density map at a higher contour level shows clearly resolved transmembrane helices. c, A cross-section view through the TMDs shows well-resolved transmembrane helices labelled red and blue for TmrA and TmrB respectively. d, NBDs of TmrAB in two different views. C-terminal helices (*) of the two NBDs are in close proximity depicted both in the density map and the docked atomic model. Figure 3: Atomic model of TmrAB showing the laterally open inward-facing conformation. a, Representation of internal volume and opening to the external surface of the transporter. TmrA is coloured salmon and TmrB is coloured cyan. b, Two different views (tilted around the axis perpendicular to the membrane plane) of the substrate-binding cavity in the TMDs. Density bound to helix H4 (Tyr 187) and H5 (His 246) of TmrB was observed at a threshold of 5σ. It has the size to accommodate a Hoechst 33342 molecule, which is a known cargo molecule of TmrAB, but was not added during the protein purification. The cargo-like density is inside the cavity but near the inner leaflet of the membrane. This position suggests a possible substrate pathway. c, Ribbon diagram of the TmrAB NBDs in the nucleotide-free state. Predicted locations of two pairs of cysteine mutations are marked. d, Non-reducing SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE) gel demonstrating disulphide cross-linking of both double cysteine mutants in the apo state, and showing a clear difference in cross-linking behaviour between nucleotide-free and -bound TmrAB. Figure 4: Comparison of the inward-facing conformation of TmrAB with the intermediate inward-facing structure of TM287/288 and the outward-facing structure of Sav1866. a, Conformational changes in the NBDs viewed from the membrane towards the cytosol. The Walker A motifs (blue) do not face the ABC signature motifs (green) in the atomic model of TmrAB (top) while they do in the TM287/288 structure (middle) where a single AMPPNP molecule (shown as sticks) is bound predominantly in one NBD. In the Sav1866 structure (bottom), the two motifs from the opposite domains come close to sandwich two ADP molecules (shown as sticks). b, Changes in lateral opening to the cavity. The lateral opening between TM4 and TM6 shown by dotted lines (left) narrows down from the TmrAB model (top) to the TM287/288 structure (middle), and completely closes in the Sav1866 structure (bottom), resulting in an opening to the extracellular space. Extended Data Fig. 1: Binding characterization of Fabs against TmrAB. a, Expression levels of Fabs used in ELISA in Fig. 1a. Expression levels were assessed by immunoblotting with anti-c-myc antibody and normalized against the highest expression level such that undiluted AD12 equals a normalized relative concentration of 1. Binding was monitored by anti-c-myc antibody. b, ELISA with purified Fabs against TmrAB. Purified Flag-tagged Fabs (Fab\u2013Flag) were used in binding reactions. Binding was monitored by anti\u2013Flag M2-peroxidase. Experiments were repeated twice. c, Relative affinities of the Fabs. The ELISA signal data from Extended Data Fig. 1b were fitted to a bimolecular binding equation to produce binding curves and apparent dissociation constant (Kd) values. AH5 showed the highest affinity, followed by BA6, AD12 and AH11. DH5 and BG12 did not show significant binding. Apparent Kd values do not yield meaningful biophysical properties because the concentration of TmrAB participating in the binding reaction is unknown and the transporter is not free in solution. However, comparison among the Fabs should be sufficient to determine their relative affinities. Unpurified DH5 showed significant binding (Extended Data Fig. 1a), whereas purified DH5 did not show significant binding; n.d., not determined. d, Negative-stain electron microscopy analysis of Fab +TmrAB mixes. Representative two-dimensional class averages include complex images that show clear Fab densities and images that do not. The two typical Fab views, the dumb-bell- and doughnut-shaped views, are indicated by yellow and red arrows respectively. Fab images indicate that Fabs are rigid and form rigid complexes. Percentages of complex particles were assessed by fractions of the numbers of images that clearly show Fab densities (# complex particles) to the total numbers of images that were included (# total particles) in two-dimensional class averages. The percentages correspond to relative affinity ranking determined by ELISA (Extended Data Fig. 1c).

        "text": "While the interaction of energetic ions with solids is well known to result in inelastic energy loss to electrons and elastic energy loss to atomic nuclei in the solid, the coupled effects of these energy losses on defect production, nanostructure evolution and phase transformations in ionic and covalently bonded materials are complex and not well understood due to dependencies on electron-electron scattering processes, electron-phonon coupling, localized electronic excitations, diffusivity of charged defects, and solid-state radiolysis. Here we show that a colossal synergy occurs between inelastic energy loss and pre-existing atomic defects created by elastic energy loss in single crystal strontium titanate (SrTiO3), resulting in the formation of nanometer-sized amorphous tracks, but only in the narrow region with pre-existing defects. These defects locally decrease the electronic and atomic thermal conductivities and increase electron-phonon coupling, which locally increase the intensity of the thermal spike for each ion. This work identifies a major gap in understanding on the role of defects in electronic energy dissipation and electron-phonon coupling; it also provides insights for creating novel interfaces and nanostructures to functionalize thin film structures, including tunable electronic, ionic, magnetic and optical properties.

        "text": "Charge transport properties in close-packed nanoparticle arrays with thickness crossing over from two dimensions to three dimensions have been studied. The dimensionality transition of nanoparticle arrays was realized by continually printing spatially well-defined nanoparticle monolayers on top of the device in situ. The evolution of charge transport properties depending on the dimensionality has been investigated in both the Efros-Shaklovskii variable-range-hopping (ES-VRH) (low temperature) regime and the sequential hopping (SH) (medium temperature) regime. We find that the energy barriers to transport decrease when the thickness of nanoparticle arrays increases from monolayer to multilayers, but start to level off at the thickness of 4\u20135 monolayers. The energy barriers are characterized by the coefficient βD at ES-VRH regime and the activation energy Ea at SH regime. Moreover, a turning point for the temperature coefficient of conductance was observed in multilayer nanoparticle arrays at high temperature, which is attributed to the increasing mobility with decreasing temperature of hopping transport in three dimensions.

        "text": "Phase competition underlies many remarkable and technologically important phenomena in transition metal oxides. Vanadium dioxide (VO2) exhibits a first-order metal\u2013insulator transition (MIT) near room temperature, where conductivity is suppressed and the lattice changes from tetragonal to monoclinic on cooling. Ongoing attempts to explain this coupled structural and electronic transition begin with two alternative starting points: a Peierls MIT driven by instabilities in electron\u2013lattice dynamics and a Mott MIT where strong electron\u2013electron correlations drive charge localization1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. A key missing piece of the VO2 puzzle is the role of lattice vibrations. Moreover, a comprehensive thermodynamic treatment must integrate both entropic and energetic aspects of the transition. Here we report that the entropy driving the MIT in VO2 is dominated by strongly anharmonic phonons rather than electronic contributions, and provide a direct determination of phonon dispersions. Our ab initio calculations identify softer bonding in the tetragonal phase, relative to the monoclinic phase, as the origin of the large vibrational entropy stabilizing the metallic rutile phase. They further reveal how a balance between higher entropy in the metal and orbital-driven lower energy in the insulator fully describes the thermodynamic forces controlling the MIT. Our study illustrates the critical role of anharmonic lattice dynamics in metal oxide phase competition, and provides guidance for the predictive design of new materials.

        "text": "When a large set of discrete bodies passes through a bottleneck, the flow may become intermittent due to the development of clogs that obstruct the constriction. Clogging is observed, for instance, in colloidal suspensions, granular materials and crowd swarming, where consequences may be dramatic. Despite its ubiquity, a general framework embracing research in such a wide variety of scenarios is still lacking. We show that in systems of very different nature and scale -including sheep herds, pedestrian crowds, assemblies of grains, and colloids- the probability distribution of time lapses between the passages of consecutive bodies exhibits a power-law tail with an exponent that depends on the system condition. Consequently, we identify the transition to clogging in terms of the divergence of the average time lapse. Such a unified description allows us to put forward a qualitative clogging state diagram whose most conspicuous feature is the presence of a length scale qualitatively related to the presence of a finite size orifice. This approach helps to understand paradoxical phenomena, such as the faster-is-slower effect predicted for pedestrians evacuating a room and might become a starting point for researchers working in a wide variety of situations where clogging represents a hindrance. Subject terms: Phase transitions and critical phenomena\u2022 Nonlinear phenomena At a glance Figures View all figures Figure 1: Sheep flow through a bottleneck.

(B) Picture taken after the gate, with a green line marking the pixels used to build the spatio-temporal diagram. (C) Spatio-temporal diagram (time increases from bottom to top). The two horizontal yellow lines mark a long time lapse and the two horizontal blue lines a short time lapse; the meaning of \u201clong\u201d and \u201cshort\u201d in this context is explained in the main text. A burst of size s = 17 spans from the green horizontal line to the lower yellow line. The upper yellow line defines the beginning of the next burst. (D) Number of evacuated sheep (#) versus time for several realizations. Horizontal segments correspond to time lapses during which no sheep crossed the green line shown in b. (E) Complementary CDF of the time lapses obtained with and without an obstacle in front of the gate. The continuous lines represent the power law fits with their exponent α, as given by the Clauset-Shalizi-Newman method10. (F) Histogram of burst sizes (s) rescaled by the average burst size (〈s〉) for the experiments with and without obstacle. The minimum lapse τmin used here to set apart bursts is 1 s. Although this choice affects the particular value of 〈s〉, the exponential tail of the distribution (continuous line in the figure) is unaffected. A straightforward calculation of the mean avalanche size gives 〈s〉 = 17 with an obstacle and 〈s〉 = 11 without an obstacle, an enhancement similar to that found in silos15.

(A) Sketch of the simulated system where L is the size of the door. (B) Distribution of burst sizes (s) rescaled by the average burst size (〈s〉) for the simulation conditions displayed in (C). The lower limit used to define the bursts is t = 5 s. Although this choice affects the particular value of 〈s〉, the exponential tail of the distribution (dashed line in the figure) is unaffected. (C,D,E) Complementary CDFs of the time lapses obtained using different simulation parameters. The reference conditions are: pedestrian desired velocity vd = 6 m/s, random force in the y-direction θ = 10 kN, and door size L = 1.0 m. In (c, d, and e), we vary vd, θ and L, respectively. In Fig. (C\u2013E) the continuous lines represent the power-law fits with exponent α, as given by the Clauset-Shalizi-Newman method10. The transition from α ≤ 2 (clogged system) to α > 2 (clog-free system) is observed in all the cases as the desired velocity is reduced and the random force or the door size are increased.

        "text": "The main direction in increasing reactivity of aluminum (Al) particles for energetic applications is reduction in their size down to nanoscale. However, Al nanoparticles are 30\u201350 times more expensive than micron scale particles and possess safety and environmental issues. Here, we improved reactivity of Al micron scale particles by synthesizing pre-stressed core-shell structures. Al particles were annealed and quenched to induce compressive stresses in the alumina passivation shell surrounding Al core. This thermal treatment was designed based on predictions of the melt-dispersion mechanism (MDM); a theory describing Al particle reaction under high heating rate. For all anneal treatment temperatures, experimental flame propagation rates for Al combined with nanoscale copper oxide (CuO) are in quantitative agreement with the theoretical predictions based on the MDM. The best treatment increases flame rate by 36% and achieves 68% of that for the best Al nanoparticles.

        "text": "Recent studies suggest that an exemplary Kondo insulator SmB6 belongs to a new class of topological insulators (TIs), in which non-trivial spin-polarized metallic states emerge on surface upon the formation of Kondo hybridization gap in the bulk. Remarkably, the bulk resistivity reaches more than 20 Ω cm at 4 K, making SmB6 a candidate for a so-called bulk-insulating TI. We here investigate optical-pulse responses of SmB6 by pump-and-probe photoemission spectroscopy. Surface photovoltage effect is observed below ~90 K. This indicates that an optically-active band bending region develops beneath the novel metallic surface upon the bulk-gap evolution. The photovoltaic effect persists for >200 µs, which is long enough to be detected by electronics devices, and could be utilized for optical gating of the novel metallic surface.

A great challenge to their use is obtaining an intact film of mesoscale colloidal crystals as a template. Here, using the plate-sliding coating method coupled with hot air flow, we successfully deposited mesoscale colloidal crystals onto the substrate. A TiO2 mesoscale IO (meso-IO) with 70 nm pores was then successfully fabricated via atomic layer deposition of TiO2 and subsequent removal of the template. As a photoelectrochemical electrode, the meso-IO structure exhibits enhanced charge transport properties as well as a high specific area. Moreover, dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated using the meso-IO electrode exhibit a higher photocurrent and cell efficiency than a cell constructed using a conventional TiO2 nanoparticle electrode. This meso-IO film provides a new platform for developing electrodes for use in various energy storage and conversion devices.

The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study results show that Fermi level continuously shifted across the LCMO/LNO interface in the interface region. In addition, the charge transfer between Mn and Ni ions of the type Mn3+ − Ni3+ Mn4+ − Ni2+ with the oxygen vacancies are observed in the interface region. The intrinsic interfacial charge transfer can give rise to itinerant electrons, which results in a \u201cshoulder feature\u201d observed at the low binding energy in the Mn 2p core level spectra. Meanwhile, the orbital reconstruction can be mapped according to the Fermi level position and the charge transfer mode. It can be considered that the ferromagnetic interaction between Ni2+ and Mn4+ gives rise to magnetic regions that pin the ferromagnetic LCMO and cause magnetic coupling at the LCMO/LNO interface.

        "text": "Topological insulators (TIs) exhibit many exotic properties. In particular, a topological magneto-electric (TME) effect, quantized in units of the fine structure constant, exists in TIs. Here, we theoretically study the scattering properties of electromagnetic waves by TI circular cylinders particularly in the Rayleigh scattering limit. Compared with ordinary dielectric cylinders, the scattering by TI cylinders shows many unusual features due to the TME effect. Two proposals are suggested to determine the TME effect of TIs simply by measuring the electric-field components of scattered waves in the far field at one or two scattering angles. Our results could also offer a way to measure the fine structure constant.

The possibility to dynamically control interface characteristics with an electric field paves the way towards voltage control of these properties in solid-state devices. Here, we show that electrical switching of the interfacial oxidation state allows for voltage control of magnetic properties to an extent never before achieved through conventional magneto-electric coupling mechanisms. We directly observe in situ voltage-driven O2− migration in a \u200bCo/metal-oxide bilayer, which we use to toggle the interfacial magnetic anisotropy energy by >0.75 erg cm−2 at just 2 V. We exploit the thermally activated nature of ion migration to markedly increase the switching efficiency and to demonstrate reversible patterning of magnetic properties through local activation of ionic migration. These results suggest a path towards voltage-programmable materials based on solid-state switching of interface oxygen chemistry.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information The concept of mass generation by means of the Higgs mechanism was strongly inspired by earlier works on the Meissner\u2013Ochsenfeld effect in superconductors. In quantum field theory, the excitations of longitudinal components of the Higgs field manifest as massive Higgs bosons. The analogous Higgs mode in superconductors has not yet been observed owing to its rapid decay into particle\u2013hole pairs. According to recent theories, however, the Higgs mode should decrease below the superconducting pairing gap 2Δ and become visible in two-dimensional systems close to the superconductor\u2013insulator transition. For experimental verification, we measured the complex terahertz transmission and tunnelling density of states of various thin films of superconducting NbN and InO close to criticality. Comparing both techniques reveals a growing discrepancy between the finite 2Δ and the threshold energy for electromagnetic absorption, which vanishes critically towards the superconductor\u2013insulator transition. We identify the excess absorption below 2Δ as strong evidence of the Higgs mode in two-dimensional quantum critical superconductors. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Broken U(1)-symmetry phase and quantum Monte Carlo calculation of the Higgs conductivity. a, When symmetry is broken, the potential acquires a Mexican hat shape, with a circle of potential minima along the brim (black solid circle). Transverse modes of the order parameter Ψ = Aeiφ along the brim (red line) are Nambu\u2013Goldstone (phase) modes, and longitudinal modes (blue line) are Higgs (amplitude) modes associated with a finite energy. In superconductivity, the potential corresponds to the free energy. b, The Higgs mode gives rise to low-frequency conductivity (in units of 4e2/h) that grows as disorder p (fraction of disconnected superconducting islands) is increased and remains finite through the quantum phase transition (orange line). At the quantum critical point, pc = 0.337, the superfluid density, ρs, in the superconducting phase vanishes and the quasiparticle gap, Δ, remains finite, whereas in the insulator ωpair, which is the energy to insert a Cooper pair to the insulator, goes to zero. Results for specific disorder (blue, green and red dashed lines) are compared to experiment (see Fig. 3). For details of the calculation see ref. 25. Figure 2: Tunnelling versus optical spectroscopy. a,b, Experimental results on low-disorder NbN samples. a, Measured tunnelling conductance normalized to the normal state conductance G/Gn (green triangles) alongside a fit to BCS (black line) with a Dynes broadening parameter, Γ. b, Real part of the dynamical conductivity, σ1, versus frequency (energy) at temperatures below and above Tc = 9.5 K. The low-temperature curve is fitted (green line) to Mattis\u2013Bardeen theory using the energy gap value obtained in the corresponding tunnelling result, Δt. c, Summary of the quasiparticle tunnelling gap, Δt (green symbols), measured by planar tunnelling junctions or scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), versus Ω, the frequency at which σ1(ω) is minimal (blue symbols), obtained from optical spectroscopy for several superconducting NbN and InO films spanning the different degrees of disorder. Whereas the quasiparticle gap, Δt, remains fairly unchanged with increasing disorder, and basically falls on the BCS strong coupling limit ratio, Ω is significantly suppressed. According to Mattis\u2013Bardeen theory, for ideal superconductors σ1 is minimal at a frequency Ω that corresponds to 2Δ. The discrepancy between both spectroscopic probes increases towards the highly disordered limit, signalling the presence of additional modes superimposed on the quasiparticle response. The solid red line corresponds to the analytical prediction of mH close to a QPT calculated by Podolsky and colleagues12. d,e, Experimental results on highly disordered NbN samples. d, Measured tunnelling conductance normalized to the normal state conductance G/Gn (green triangles) together with a fit to BCS (black line) with a Dynes broadening parameter, Γ. e, Real part of the dynamical conductivity, σ1, versus frequency (energy) at temperatures below and above Tc = 4.2 K. The low-temperature curve is fitted (green line) to Mattis\u2013Bardeen theory using the energy gap value obtained in the corresponding tunnelling result. Unlike the case of the low-disorder sample, these two curves differ. The excess spectral weight, marked in yellow and defined as the difference between the curves, is attributed to the Higgs contribution, σ1H (see text). The error bars for σ1 in the graphs are determined by the distortion of the Fabry\u2013Perot oscillations due to parasitic radiation, standing waves and electronic noise. Figure 3: Higgs conductivity and spectral weight. a, Experimental and theoretical results for the Higgs conductivity σ1H, as a function of energy for three NbN films of different disorder. The numerical results25 were obtained for a fixed value of EC/EJ, whereas the degree of disorder, reflecting breaking bonds between the superconducting islands, is denoted by p. Qualitative and quantitative features are shared by both experiment and theory. The sharp lines in the experimental data are due to interpolation between measured data points. b, Charge carrier density N in the normal state obtained from Hall measurements (red squares) and superfluid density, ρs, measured by optical spectroscopy as functions of Tc/Tcclean (reflecting the degree of disorder). Note the faster decrease of ρs with increasing disorder, indicating the vanishing contribution of the superfluid condensate to the spectral weight. c, Redistribution of the \u2018missing\u2019 spectral weight s between the normal and superconducting states versus the superfluid density ρs, as defined in equation (4). The observed linear relation indicates that the redistribution of the spectral weight occurs within our measured energy spectrum.

        "text": "Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and their van der Waals heterostructures have been experimentally and theoretically demonstrated as potential candidates for photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices due to the suitable bandgap and excellent light absorption. In this work, we report the observation of photodiode behavior in (both n- and p- type) silicon/monolayer MoS2 vertical heterostructures. The photocurrent and photoresponsivity of heterostructures photodiodes were dependent both on the incident light wavelength and power density, and the highest photoresponsivity of 7.2 A/W was achieved in n-Si/monolayer MoS2 vertical heterostructures photodiodes. Compared with n-Si/MoS2 heterostructures, the photoresponsivity of p-Si/MoS2 heterostructure was much lower. Kelvin probe microscope (KFM) results demonstrated the more efficient separation of photogenerated excitons in n-Si/MoS2 than that in p-Si/MoS2. Coupling KFM results with band alignments of (p-, n-) Si/MoS2 heterostructures, the origins of photodiode-like phenomena of p-Si/MoS2 and n-Si/MoS2 have been unveiled, that is intrinsic built-in electric field in p-n junction, and modulated barrier height and width at the interface in n-n junction. Our work may benefit to the deep understanding of the integration of two-dimensional materials with more conventional three-dimensional semiconductors, and then contribute to the developments in the area of van der Waals heterostructures.

(b) The I\u2013V curves dependent on the tip-sample contact force. The inset presents the I\u2013V curve with larger contact force of 20 nN.

The power densities vary from 4 to 50 mW/cm2. The I\u2013V curves of n-Si/MoS2 heterostructures present non-ideal photodiode-like behavior, where the reverse current increases with power density and the forward bias keeps almost constant regardless of power density. The weak photovoltaic effect was observed, where short current ISC and open circuit voltage VOC are small, as shown in insets of Figure 2a\u2013d. (e) The band alignment at the interface between n-Si and monolayer MoS2 at equilibrium, forward bias and reverse bias upon illumination. In the forward bias, photogenerated excitons could not be separated effectively due to the relatively larger barriers for holes and electrons transfer. However, the photogenerated holes could transferfrom the valance band of MoS2 to n-Si, leading to the effective and efficient separation of excitons in the reverse bias.

        "text": "Semiconductor-microcavity polaritons are composite quasiparticles of excitons and photons, emerging in the strong coupling regime. As quantum superpositions of matter and light, polaritons have much stronger interparticle interactions compared with photons, enabling rapid equilibration and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). Current realizations based on 1D photonic structures, such as Fabry-Pérot microcavities, have limited light-trapping ability resulting in picosecond polariton lifetime. We demonstrate, theoretically, above-room-temperature (up to 590 K) BEC of long-lived polaritons in MoSe2 monolayers sandwiched by simple TiO2 based 3D photonic band gap (PBG) materials. The 3D PBG induces very strong coupling of 40 meV (Rabi splitting of 62 meV) for as few as three dichalcogenide monolayers. Strong light-trapping in the 3D PBG enables the long-lived polariton superfluid to be robust against fabrication-induced disorder and exciton line-broadening.

        "text": "The spirally arranged stems of the spikemoss Selaginella lepidophylla, an ancient resurrection plant, compactly curl into a nest-ball shape upon dehydration. Due to its spiral phyllotaxy, older outer stems on the plant interlace and envelope the younger inner stems forming the plant centre. Stem curling is a morphological mechanism that limits photoinhibitory and thermal damages the plant might experience in arid environments. Here, we investigate the distinct conformational changes of outer and inner stems of S. lepidophylla triggered by dehydration. Outer stems bend into circular rings in a relatively short period of desiccation, whereas inner stems curl slowly into spirals due to hydro-actuated strain gradient along their length. This arrangement eases both the tight packing of the plant during desiccation and its fast opening upon rehydration. The insights gained from this work shed light on the hydro-responsive movements in plants and might contribute to the development of deployable structures with remarkable shape transformations in response to environmental stimuli.

While lignified cell walls (dark blue) are found throughout the inner zone of the cortical tissue, there appears to be a difference of cell density between the adaxial and abaxial zones. Basic Fuchsin was used to visualize lignin within the cell walls of the stem tissue. The cross-sections of a Basic Fuchsin stained, paraffin-embedded, inner stem at (f) the basal section reveal lignification (bright red) in all the ground tissue, whereas (g) the middle of the stem, shows lignified tissues in the abaxial side of the stem.

Plotted as a function of the weight loss w* of the stem during dehydration, the absolute displacements of the stem tip, ux and uy, and the reaction force of a similar stem clamped at its both ends illustrate that stem curling correlates with induced-stress buildup.

(d) A simplified FE model for hydro-responsive curling of S. lepidophylla plants showing the cooperative packing of outer and inner stems at different stages of dehydration. The contours represent the absolute rotation of the stems in radian. Note that in actual S. lepidophylla plants, the spiral phyllotaxy would yield a gradient of curvature moving from the centre of the plant. Also, both the properties of the inner stems, and their shading by the more rapidly closing outer stems would slow their dehydration process, thus the timing of the movement of the inner stems would be delayed in real plants.

        "text": "Electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) has emerged as a powerful tool to electrically manipulate tiny individual droplets in a controlled manner. Despite tremendous progress over the past two decades, current EWOD operating in ambient conditions has limited functionalities posing challenges for its applications, including electronic display, energy generation, and microfluidic systems. Here, we demonstrate a new paradigm of electrowetting on liquid-infused film (EWOLF) that allows for complete reversibility and tunable transient response simultaneously. We determine that these functionalities in EWOLF are attributed to its novel configuration, which allows for the formation of viscous liquid-liquid interfaces as well as additional wetting ridges, thereby suppressing the contact line pinning and severe droplet oscillation encountered in the conventional EWOD. Finally, by harnessing these functionalities demonstrated in EWOLF, we also explore its application as liquid lens for fast optical focusing.

(a) SEM image of the PTFE membrane consisting of nano-fiber networks. The scale bar is 4 μm. (b) Photograph showing a PTFE membrane (white dashed-line rectangle) attached to a transparent ITO glass substrate (red dashed-line rectangle). Underneath the PTFE/ITO is a paper with printed patterns (logo arrays, in blue and green). Without the infiltration of oil lubricant, the PTFE membrane is opaque. (c) Optical image of the liquid-infused film (circled with white dashed-lines) attached to an ITO substrate. The pattern underlying the film is clearly visualized, revealing the transparency of the liquid-infused film. (d) Optical transmittance measurement showing the enhanced optical transmittance of the liquid-infused film (blue solid line) relative to that of the PTFE membrane (red solid line). The enhanced optical transmittance in the liquid-infused film is owing to the reduced light scattering at the air/liquid/solid interfaces rendered by the replacement of air pockets by the oil. Full size image View in article Figure 2: Wetting properties of liquid-infused film and electrowetting response. (a) Optical image of a stained droplet in EWOLF subject to an actuation voltage of 500 V, which displays an apparent CA of ~53°. The scale bar is 400 μm. (b) The formation of wetting ridge as a result of oil motion at the liquid-liquid interface. The scale bar is 200 μm. (c) Characterization of the variations of apparent CA in EWOD and EWOLF. For the liquid-infused film, there is a perfect fidelity between the apparent CA in the spreading (the applied potential is increased) and receding (the applied potential is decreased) period, indicating a full reversibility. In contrast, there exists a large hysteresis in the electrowetting response to the increasing and decreasing potentials on the PTFE membrane, suggesting an irreversible electrowetting. (d) The variation of droplet apparent CA subject to electrowetting cycles. Droplet on the liquid-infused film exhibits nearly perfect electrowetting reversibility with apparent CA switching between ~103° and ~53° when the droplet is excited by voltage-on and voltage-off for 10 cycles (blue line). In contrast, the electrowetting on the PTFE membrane is irreversible. Subject to a cyclic voltage-on/voltage-off actuation, the droplet in EWOD attains a switching angle of less than 5°. Full size image View in article Figure 3: Droplet oscillation suppression in the transient response of EWOLF. (a\u2013b) Transient responses of the activating droplet characterized by the normalized contact diameter (l/l0) and droplet height (h/h0) on the PTFE membrane (a) and the liquid infused film (b). During the electrowetting, the transient response of droplet displays two distinctive modes, which are MCL and CCL modes, respectively. In the MCL stage, the maximum contact diameter in EWOD overshoots its final steady-state value, suggesting the under-damped oscillation nature of the activating drop. In the CCL stage, the droplet height attains periodical oscillations. By contrast, for the case of EWOLF, the normalized contact diameter progressively increases without retraction in the MCL stage and droplet oscillation in the droplet height is substantially reduced. Moreover, the response time for the droplet to reach a steady state is ~45 ms, representing over 90% reduction compared to that in EWOD. Such a droplet oscillation suppression in the transient response of EWOLF is ascribed to the introduction of viscous liquid lubricant in the porous PTFE matrix, which allows for the formation of additional wetting ridges at the periphery of the droplet as well as viscous liquid-liquid interfaces underneath the droplet.

(b, c) Time lapsed images of a standard resolution target formed through the adaptive liquid lens in EWOLF (b) and (c) EWOD, respectively. The response time for the EWOLF and EWOD to have sharp and stable images is ~50 and ~250 ms, respectively. When the images captured through the EWOLF have reached a steady state, the images through the EWOD still undergo periodical oscillations, alternating between blurry and sharp states, as indicated by selected snapshots of images within one period of the vibration ranging between ~44.5 ms and ~53.5 ms. (d) The fluctuation in imaging in EWOD is due to the continuous droplet oscillation, as shown by the time variation of the normalized droplet height. The normalized droplet height at 51.0 ms is 0.61905, which is consistent with the steady-state value. However, at 53.5 ms, the droplet height increases to 0.66786, deviating from the equilibrium state for optical focusing and therefore leading to an unfocused image.

(a) Transient responses of normalized droplet height on three control surfaces (2012, 2080, and 5080), corresponding to the PTFE membrane infused with FC-70 of 20 μm, Krytox GPL103 of 20 μm and 50 μm, respectively. For electrowetting on surfaces 2080 and 2012, there exists remarkable overshooting in the transient response of normalized droplet height relative to their individual steady-state values in the MCL stage whereas on the surface 5080 the droplet height gradually decays until reaching its steady state. The response time of droplet to reach the steady state on the surface 5080 is ~78 ms, which is much larger than that on surfaces 2012 (~65 ms) and 2080 (~50 ms). (b) Plots showing the damping ratio of all the surfaces investigated. The damping ratio in the MCL stage exhibits a considerable dependence on the thickness and viscosity of liquid lubricant whereas the damping ratio in the CCL stage in EWOLF becomes almost insensitive to the liquid thickness and viscosity, though they are still much larger than that in EWOD.

        "text": "Glazing for adaptive solar control is the most promising for energy efficient development, because the use of this technology in buildings can be expected to significantly impact energy use and efficiency by screening sunlight that enters a building in summer. To achieve autonomous adjustable transparency, we have developed photothermotropic material system by combining photothermal materials with thermotropic hydrogels. We found that graphene oxide dispersed within a hydrogel matrix effectively converts the photo energy of sunlight into thermal energy, providing the efficient means to trigger transparency of thermotropic hydrogels. Therefore, we could develop switchable glazing of novel photothermotropic mechanism that screen strong sunlight and heat radiation in response to the sunlight intensity, as well as the temperature. Furthermore, in this study, a prototype device was manufactured with developed materials and successfully operated in outdoor testing.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information The development of molecular-scale electronic devices has made considerable progress over the past decade, and single-molecule transistors, diodes and wires have all been demonstrated. Despite this remarkable progress, the agreement between theoretically predicted conductance values and those measured experimentally remains limited. One of the primary reasons for these discrepancies lies in the difficulty to experimentally determine the contact geometry and binding configuration of a single-molecule junction. In this Article, we apply a small-amplitude, high-frequency, sinusoidal mechanical signal to a series of single-molecule devices during junction formation and breakdown. By measuring the current response at this frequency, it is possible to determine the most probable binding and contact configurations for the molecular junction at room temperature in solution, and to obtain information about how an applied strain is distributed within the molecular junction. These results provide insight into the complex configuration of single-molecule devices, and are in excellent agreement with previous predictions from theoretical models. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Mechanically modulated STM break-junction experiments. a, Schematic of the experimental set-up showing a \u200bC6-DT molecule bound to two \u200bAu electrodes as a small, sinusoidal mechanical modulation is applied while withdrawing the tip electrode. b, Example of a current versus distance trace obtained during tip withdrawal (blue trace) showing no steps in the current. The normalized current (α) at the modulation frequency (2 kHz) is extracted from this trace (grey curve). This experiment was performed on \u200bC6-MT; no steps occur in the decay curve and the amplitude of α is approximately constant because the molecule is incapable of forming a junction. c, Histogram from thousands of \u200bC6-MT traces similar to those shown in b. The black trace shows the most probable value of α at each conductance. The green trace shows the value of β obtained by averaging thousands of current versus distance traces and taking the derivative. d, Representative conductance versus distance (blue) and α versus distance (grey) curves measured during electrode separation for a \u200bC6-DT junction. e, 2D histogram for \u200bC6-DT showing a maximum population at the conductance of ~3 × 10−4G0 and the corresponding α of ~0.8 nm−1.

The red dashed lines are guides to the eye. d, The natural logarithm of conductance is plotted versus molecular length for both the dithiol (blue) and diamine (red) families from C6 to C10.

In order to solve this problem, we calculate Mg acceptor activation energy and investigate its relationship with Mg local structure in nanoscale (AlN)5/(GaN)1 superlattice (SL), a substitution for Al0.83Ga0.17N disorder alloy, using first-principles calculations. A universal picture to reduce acceptor activation energy in wide-gap semiconductors is given for the first time. By reducing the volume of the acceptor local structure slightly, its activation energy can be decreased remarkably. Our results show that Mg acceptor activation energy can be reduced significantly from 0.44 eV in Al0.83Ga0.17N disorder alloy to 0.26 eV, very close to the Mg acceptor activation energy in GaN, and a high hole concentration in the order of 1019 cm−3 can be obtained in (AlN)5/(GaN)1 SL by MgGa δ-doping owing to GaN-monolayer modulation. We thus open up a new way to reduce Mg acceptor activation energy and increase hole concentration in Al-rich AlGaN.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information In the past decade there has been a surge in research at the boundary between photonics and phononics. Most efforts have centred on coupling light to motion in a high-quality optical cavity, typically geared towards manipulating the quantum state of a mechanical oscillator. It was recently predicted that the strength of the light\u2013sound interaction would increase drastically in nanoscale silicon photonic wires. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, such a giant overlap between near-infrared light and gigahertz sound co-localized in a small-core silicon wire. The wire is supported by a tiny pillar to block the path for external phonon leakage, trapping 10 GHz phonons in an area of less than 0.1 μm2. Because our geometry can also be studied in microcavities, it paves the way for complete fusion between the fields of cavity optomechanics and Brillouin scattering. The results bode well for the realization of optically driven lasers/sasers, isolators and comb generators on a densely integrated silicon chip. At a glance Figures Figure 1: A silicon wire on a pillar as an acoustic phonon cavity. a, Top view of the silicon wire. Light propagates along the wire. It confines photons because of its high optical contrast with the silicon dioxide substrate and the air. b, Unlike the photons, the phonons are trapped transversally. The leakage of phonons through the pillar determines their lifetime (τ ≈ 5 ns). c, Scanning electron micrograph of the 450 × 230 nm cross-section. Before ion milling, platina (Pt) is deposited on the wire for better visualization (see Methods). Pillars as narrow as 15 nm were fabricated reliably. d, The horizontal component of the observed hypersonic mode u (red, −; blue, +) aligns with the bulk electrostrictive forces (black arrows) and the boundary radiation pressure (grey arrows). e, Electric field norm of the quasi-TE optical mode. Figure 2: Experimental characterization of photon\u2013phonon coupling. a, Typical Lorentzian gain profile on a Stokes seed. Inset: depletion profile on an anti-Stokes seed. In both cases, the interaction generates acoustic phonons and redshifted photons (energy diagram). Such resonances are observed in wires as short as 2.7 mm (see Supplementary Information) with a highest on/off gain of 175% (4.4 dB) in the 4 cm spiral (Leff = 1.5 cm) with 35 mW on-chip pump power. There is a remnant of a second resonance at 9.15 GHz (see Supplementary Information). The normalized Stokes power is fit to the exponential of a Lorentzian function (Supplementary equation (6)). b, Fibre-based set-up used to study forward SBS. A tunable laser is amplified in the upper arm by an erbium-doped fibre amplifier (EDFA) to serve as a pump. In the lower arm, the laser light is intensity modulated (IM) to generate a blue- and redshifted sideband. Next, a fibre Bragg grating (FBG) rejects all but the Stokes seed (see Methods). The pump and Stokes seed are coupled to the chip through curved grating couplers. Finally, the power in the pump and Stokes wave is monitored separately. Light traps (LTs) prevent backscattered light from entering the circuit. With minor modifications this set-up can be reconfigured to observe the loss on an anti-Stokes seed or the backward SBS. The latter is weak in our wires (see Supplementary Information) so we focused on forward SBS. c, A typical Fano signature obtained from the XPM experiment, which is used to calibrate the Brillouin with respect to the Kerr nonlinearity (γSBS/γK = 2.5). d, A pump is intensity-modulated, amplified, combined with a probe wave and sent to the chip. The pump is removed at the output by a bandpass filter (BPF). The phase modulation on the probe wave is transducted to intensity modulation by filtering out the redshifted sideband. Finally, an electrical spectrum analyser (ESA) is used to observe the beat between the probe and the imprinted blue sideband. Figure 3: Analysis of Brillouin gain and phononic resonance frequency. a, Scaling of the on/off Brillouin gain with input pump power. Above a power threshold of 25 mW, the on/off gain saturates because of nonlinear absorption. A fit is performed to obtain the Brillouin nonlinearity below that threshold. b, Phononic resonance frequency for different waveguide widths. Error bars indicate an estimate of the uncertainty on the waveguide width. The uncertainty on the resonance frequency (y axis) is smaller than the size of the points. Both a simple Fabry\u2013Pérot and rigorous finite-element model agree with the data. Figure 4: Study of the mechanical quality factor and intrinsic photon\u2013phonon overlap. a, The quality factor stays above 250 even in 4-cm-long spirals, showing no length-dependent line broadening. There is also peak splitting in the 1 cm spiral (see Supplementary Information). Neither the longer spirals nor the straight wires exhibit such splitting. b, A finite-element model of phonon leakage through the pillar accurately predicts the observed quality factors (L = 2.7 mm). c, The non-resonant nonlinearity (2γSBS/Qm) is a measure of intrinsic photon\u2013phonon coupling. The electrostriction (black) and radiation pressure (green) interfere constructively, bringing about total overlap (red). As the width increases, the boundary contribution vanishes rapidly. The error bars are estimates of the uncertainty on the width (horizontal) and coupling (vertical).

These rutile TiO2 mesocrystals with a Wulff shape are composed of ultra-tiny rod-like subunits with the same oriented direction and closely wrapped by the nanosheets of reduced graphene oxide (RGO). It is found that ADBS played a key role for the formation of mesocrystals during the self-assembly process, which pillared the graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets and involved the aggregation of the mesocrystal subunits. Furthermore, the TGR hybrids are used as an anode material and exhibited a large capacity over 150 mA h g−1 at 20 C after 1000 cycles, and high rate capability up to 40 C.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information High-temperature superconductivity emerges on doping holes or electrons into antiferromagnetic copper oxides. The large energy scale of magnetic excitations, for example, compared with phonon energies, is thought to drive superconductivity with high transition temperatures (Tc). Comparing high-energy magnetic excitations of hole- and electron-doped superconductors provides an opportunity to test this hypothesis. Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering at the Cu L3-edge to reveal collective excitations in the electron-doped cuprate Nd2−xCexCuO4. Surprisingly, magnetic excitations harden significantly across the antiferromagnetic high-temperature superconductivity phase boundary despite short-ranged antiferromagnetic correlations, in contrast to the hole-doped cuprates. Furthermore, we find an unexpected branch of collective modes in superconducting compounds, absent in hole-doped cuprates. These modes emanate from the zone centre and possess a higher temperature scale than Tc, signalling a distinct quantum phase. Despite their differences, the persistence of magnetic excitations and the existence of a distinct quantum phase are apparently universal in both hole- and electron-doped cuprates. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Magnons in antiferromagnetic NCCO (x = 0.04). a, Energy\u2013momentum intensity maps (top) and waterfall plots (bottom) of representative resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra along (0, 0)\u2013(π, 0) and (0, 0)\u2013(π,π), respectively. Here momenta are expressed in units of the reciprocal lattice spacing (1/a). Red ticks indicate the maxima of the spectra, which are dominated by single-magnon excitations. The data were taken with the σ polarization. b, Representative spectra taken with π andσ incident X-ray polarizations at symmetric q∥ positions. Thick black curves are from the sum of Gaussian fits to the elastic scattering peak as well as phonon (two thin black curves), a single-magnon peak (red shaded region) and a constant background (black dashed line). The residual spectral weight after subtracting this fit is shown by the blue curves. The fitted magnon peak positions have been superimposed on the colour maps in a (red markers) and further summarized in c. c, Magnon dispersion along (0, 0)\u2013(π, 0) and (0, 0)\u2013(π,π) deduced from RIXS spectra. The dashed curves show a linear-spin-wave theory dispersion for a two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model fitted to the data with cs = 830 ± 9 meV Å. Error bars are estimated by the uncertainty in determining the energy loss reference point. Figure 2: Paramagnons and unexpected collective modes in superconducting NCCO (x = 0.147). a, Energy\u2013momentum intensity maps (top) and waterfall plots (bottom) of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra along (0, 0)\u2013(π, 0) and (0, 0)\u2013(π,π), respectively. Red (blue) ticks indicate the peak positions for paramagnons (unexpected collective modes). The data were taken with the σ polarization. b, Spectra near the Γ point with finer momentum steps to highlight the dispersion of the unexpected collective modes. c, RIXS spectra taken with π andσ incident X-ray polarizations at symmetric q∥ points. The red and blue shaded areas are Gaussian fits to the paramagnons and the collective modes, respectively. The thick black curve is a fit to the data. The thin black and dashed black curves are a Gaussian fit to the elastic scattering signal and the background as determined from the dd and charge-transfer excitations at higher energy loss. d, Paramagnon and collective mode dispersions along (0, 0)\u2013(π, 0) and (0, 0)\u2013(π,π) directions deduced from RIXS spectra. The paramagnon dispersion deviates from simple linear-spin-wave theory (as a guide-to-eye, black dashed curve, with cs = 1,240 meV Å). Superimposed for comparison is the magnon dispersion in the x = 0.04 compound. The blue dashed line is a fit to the collective mode dispersion in the form of generic collective charge excitations, as described in the text. Error bars are estimated by the uncertainty in determining the energy loss reference point.

The data were taken at 80 K and using the σ polarization scattering geometry. b, Energy\u2013momentum dispersion of the collective modes in superconducting compounds x = 0.147 (open symbol) and x = 0.166 (closed symbol). The shaded area indicates the energy\u2013momentum region that was not resolvable owing to finite resolution of the instrument. Error bars are estimated by the uncertainty in determining the energy loss reference point. c, Temperature-dependent RIXS spectra taken at a momentum position near the Γ point for x = 0.147 (top) and x = 0.166 (bottom) compounds. d, The temperature-dependent spectral weight of the collective modes, shown in c, is calculated by integrating the background-subtracted spectra between 0.2 and 0.4 eV. As motivated by the T = 270 K spectra of the x = 0.166 compound, the background is assumed to be independent of energy, with the value of the spectral intensity at 1 eV. The temperature-dependent spectral weight is normalized to that of the lowest temperature. The error bars are estimated by the noise level of the spectra. The temperature-dependent spectral weight is also superimposed in the phase diagram (right panel) via colour intensity stripes to demonstrate the pronounced change in temperature dependence within a small doping window.

Sketches of the collective excitation spectra in energy\u2013momentum space for electron-doped (e-SC, NCCO), lightly doped antiferromagnetic (AFM) and hole-doped (h-SC) superconducting cuprates. Representative data points shown in Figs 1 and 2 have been superimposed on the panels for e-SC. The bandwidth of magnetic excitations is marked on the energy axis. The low-energy magnetic excitations along (π,π)\u2013(0,π) near (π,π) obtained via inelastic neutron scattering are sketched on the images. The spin gap (ΔS) and spin incommensurability (ε) are not drawn to scale. The lowest panel is a sketch of the cuprate phase diagram. The dots represent quantum critical points associated with symmetry-broken states (labelled as \u2018other order\u2019) on both sides of the phase diagram. Although the existence of such a quantum critical point on the electron-doped side of phase diagram is suggested by our results, its exact position remains an open question.

        "text": "Abstract\u2022 References\u2022 Author information\u2022 Supplementary information Chemical functionalization of low-dimensional materials such as nanotubes, nanowires and graphene leads to profound changes in their properties and is essential for solubilizing them in common solvents. Covalent attachment of functional groups is generally achieved at defect sites, which facilitate electron transfer. Here, we describe a simple and general method for covalent functionalization of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets (\u200bMoS2, \u200bWS2 and \u200bMoSe2), which does not rely on defect engineering. The functionalization reaction is instead facilitated by electron transfer between the electron-rich metallic 1T phase and an organohalide reactant, resulting in functional groups that are covalently attached to the chalcogen atoms of the transition metal dichalcogenide. The attachment of functional groups leads to dramatic changes in the optoelectronic properties of the material. For example, we show that it renders the metallic 1T phase semiconducting, and gives it strong and tunable photoluminescence and gate modulation in field-effect transistors. At a glance Figures Figure 1: Schematic of functionalization scheme. a, Side view of the 2H and 1T phases. b, The 2H phase of TMDs is converted to the 1T phase via lithiation using \u200bbutyllithium (\u200bBuLi), and the 1T phase is negatively charged. n− indicates the excess charges carried by the exfoliated 1T-phase nanosheets. c, The nanosheets are functionalized using \u200b2-iodoacetamide or \u200biodomethane (R-I) solution. d, The charge on the nanosheets can also be quenched by reacting with \u200biodine, with no covalent functionalization. Figure 2: XPS spectra of functionalized TMDs. a\u2013c, High-resolution spectra from the N1s and Mo3p (left-hand spectra), and either S2p or Se3d (right-hand spectra) regions from \u200bMoS2 (a), \u200bWS2 (b) and \u200bMoSe2 (c). Chemically exfoliated TMDs contain a mixture of 1T and 2H phases. The XPS peak of the 1T phase is downshifted by ~0.9 eV relative to the 2H peak10. The overall signal for each TMD material is shown in black, signals from the C\u2013S/Se bond, 1T and 2H phases are shown in green, blue and red, respectively. The presence of the N1s signal at ~400 eV for \u200bacetamide-functionalized TMDs confirms attachment of the amide functional groups on the surface of the nanosheets. Peaks associated with the 1T phase, S\u2013C and Se\u2013C components become more pronounced after functionalization, as indicated by arrows. Figure 3: ATR-FTIR spectra of methyl-functionalized TMDs. a\u2013d, Spectra of \u200biodomethane (green, a), functionalized 1T \u200bMoS2 (red, b), functionalized 1T \u200bWS2 (blue, c) and functionalized 1T \u200bMoSe2 (orange, d) showing stretching (ν) deformation (δ) and rocking (ρ) modes. The -CH3 and Se\u2013C vibration modes are notably shifted for \u200bMoSe2 compared with modes for \u200bMoS2 and \u200bWS2, indicating that covalent attachment of functional groups occurs via the chalcogen atoms. Figure 4: NMR spectra for functionalized TMDs. a\u2013e,13C CP-MAS spectra of \u200b2-iodoacetamide (a) and functionalized 1T \u200bMoS2 (b), 300 °C-annealed functionalized \u200bMoS2 (c), functionalized 1T \u200bWS2 (d) and functionalized 1T \u200bMoSe2 (e). Green peaks designate the C signals corresponding to carbonyls and blue peaks show α-C signals. The peaks arising from the α-C (blue) are shifted relative to free \u200biodoacetamide, whereas the carbonyl C (green) peaks remain relatively constant. The fact that the α-C peaks remain relatively constant in curves b and d suggests that bonding is through the sulfur atoms in \u200bMoS2 and \u200bWS2. Figure 5: Photoluminescence from functionalized 1T-phase \u200bMoS2. a, Photoluminescence spectra obtained from single-layer \u200bMoS2 grown by CVD (2H phase), from the metallic 1T phase and from the functionalized 1T phase. A strong photoluminescence peak at ~1.8 eV is observed for the 2H phase, consistent with single-layer 2H \u200bMoS2, whereas photoluminescence is quenched after conversion to the metallic 1T phase. The functionalized 1T phase exhibits strong photoluminescence, characterized by two bands at ~1.9 eV and ~1.6 eV. Inset: a typical CVD-grown monolayer triangular nanosheet on which the photoluminescence spectra were measured.

RyRs are the largest known ion channels, with a homotetrameric organization and approximately 5,000 residues in each protomer.

The four elongated S6 segments form a right-handed helical bundle that closes the pore at the cytoplasmic border of the membrane. Allosteric regulation of the pore by the cytoplasmic domains is mediated through extensive interactions between the central domains and the channel domain. These structural features explain high ion conductance by RyRs and the long-range allosteric regulation of channel activities.

The channel passage, calculated by HOLE40, is depicted by cyan dots (left). The pore radii along the ion-conducting pathway are tabulated (right), in which the dashed lines indicate segments of poor electron microscopy densities. The position of the S4\u2013S5 helical axis is set as the origin of the y axis. e, A unique C-terminal domain (CTD) is tightly connected to S6 in each RyR1 protomer.

Figure 4: The intra- and inter-domain contacts of the RyR1 channel domain may contribute to channel gating. a, The VSC and CTD mediate the interactions between the channel domain and the central domain in the cytoplasmic region of RyR1. Shown in the inset is a circle formed by the cytoplasmic fragment of S6, CTD and VSC that provides the primary accommodation site for the central domain. Only one protomer is domain-coloured, and the other three protomers are shown in light to dark grey in semi-transparent surface view. b, Analysis of the interactions between the channel and central domain.

Extended Data Fig. 1: Purification and cryo-EM analysis of the rabbit RyR1 complex bound to the modulator FKBP12. a, The final step of purification of the rabbit RyR1 bound to FKBP12. Shown here are a size-exclusion chromatogram of the RyR1\u2013FKBP12 complex (left) and a SDS\u2013PAGE gel of the peak fractions visualized by Coomassie blue staining (right). The shaded fractions in the left panel were pooled for cryo-EM analysis. kDa, kilodaltons; UV, ultraviolet. b, A representative electron micrograph of the rabbit RyR1\u2013FKBP12 complex. Scale bar, 20 nm. c, Two-dimensional class averages of the electron micrographs. d, Gold-standard FSC curves for the density maps. The overall resolution is estimated at 3.8 Å. e, Tilt-pair validation of the correctness of the map. Particles of RyR1 were imaged twice at 0° and 20° tilt angles. The position of each dot represents the direction and amount of tilting for a particle pair in polar coordinates. Blue and red dots correspond to in-plane and out-of-plane tilt transformations, respectively. Most of the blue dots cluster at a tilt angle of approximately 20°, which validates the structure. f, Angular distribution for the final reconstruction. Each sphere represents one view and the size of the sphere is proportional to the number of particles for that view. The azimuth angle only spans 90° because of the four-fold symmetry axis that runs from top to bottom. g, FSC curves between the model and the cryo-EM map. Shown here are the FSC curves between the final refined atomic model and the reconstruction from all particles (black), between the model refined in the reconstruction from only half of the particles and the reconstruction from that same half (FSCwork, green), and between that same model and the reconstruction from the other half of the particles (FSCtest, red). h, The overall electron microscopy density map of the RyR1\u2013FKBP12 is colour-coded to indicate a range of resolutions. Much of the central region of RyR1 is resolved at resolutions better than the overall 3.8 Å, while the periphery of the structure is of much lower resolution. i, Electron microscopy density map for the channel domain of the rabbit RyR1.Two perpendicular views are shown. The electron microscopy density maps were generated in Chimera67.

Detailed descriptions can be found in Methods. b, Correlation between the previously assigned sub-regions21, 22 and the corresponding domains in our 3.8 Å structure. c, The boundaries of the identified domains in the current structure of RyR1. HD, helical domain. The P2 domain is a phosphorylation hotspot in RyRs. P1 shares homology with P2. The numbers below the domains indicate their sequence boundaries. Those labelled red were identified on the basis of well-defined electron microscopy density maps. It is of particular note that the three SPRY domains and P1 domain appear to be intertwined. See Extended Data Fig. 6b for the following structural descriptions. Each SPRY domain consists mainly of a β-sandwich. In addition to the core β-sandwich (residues 639\u2013826), SPRY1 also contains two pairs of anti-parallel β-strands (residues 1466\u20131491, brown, and 1615\u20131634, magenta), the primary sequences of which are connected to those of SPRY3. Similarly, SPRY2 contains a pair of anti-parallel β-strands (residues 827\u2013845, silver) from SPRY1. The sequences of SPRY2 are also interrupted by those of the P1 domain. Consequently, the N and C termini of the SPRY1\u20133 region (residues 639 and 1634) are both contained within the SPRY1 structure. Extended Data Fig. 3: Electron microscopy density maps for the domains whose atomic structural models were generated de novo. a, The electron microscopy density maps for the handle domain. Representative density map for one helix in the handle domain is shown on the right. b, The electron microscopy density maps for the central domain.

Shown here are the density maps for the pore forming elements (c), the selectivity filter (d), the luminal hairpin loop (e), the CTD shown in stereo views (f), and VSL domain (g). The maps, shown as blue mesh, are contoured at 4σ and made in PyMol. Representative bulky residues which were used to aid sequence assignment are shown as sticks and labelled. Extended Data Fig. 4: Sequence alignment of RyR orthologues. Secondary structural elements are indicated above the sequence alignment and domains are coloured the same as the structures shown in the main text figures. The numbering of the secondary elements refers to their sequential positions within the corresponding domains. Invariant amino acids are shaded light grey. The GenInfo Identifier (GI) codes for the sequences from top to bottom: rabbit RyR1 (156119408), human RyR1 (113204615), human RyR2 (308153558) and human RyR3 (325511382). Extended Data Fig. 5: Continued sequence alignment of RyR orthologues. Owing to the enormous size of the proteins, the sequence alignment was divided into two figures with an overlap at the helix 7b from the helical domain. Notably, it was predicted that several EF-hand domains may exist between residues 4252 and 4545 (ref. 4). The lack of electron microscopy density for these domains may indicate their intrinsic flexibility in the absence of Ca2+. The structure and mechanism of these putative EF-hand domains await further investigation. Extended Data Fig. 6: Organization of the cytoplasmic domains of RyR1. a, The NTD (yellow) participates in tetramerization. Compared to the previously reported crystal structure of the NTD28, five additional α-helices (residues 560\u2013631, orange) were identified in the electron microscopy structure. b, The structure of the SPRY1\u20133 domains. See Extended Data Fig. 2c for the sequence assignment of the three intertwined domains. Note that the N terminus of SPRY1 is preceded by the NTD, and its C terminus (magenta) is followed by the handle domain (cyan). c, Structure of the handle domain. The disordered sequences are indicated by dashed lines. d, The helical domain comprises two discontinuous sequence fragments, HD1 and HD2, which are disrupted by the P2 domain. e, The helical repeats in subdomain C of the NTD resemble the armadillo repeats. Shown here is a superposition with a designed armadillo protein (PDB code 4DB8). f, Structural superposition of the handle domain with β-catenin (PDB code 3IFQ) suggests that five pairs of helices, 1\u20132, 4\u20135, 8\u20139, 10\u201311 and 14\u201315, in the handle domain exhibit structural homology to the armadillo repeats. g, The helical repeats in the central domain are armadillo-like repeats. Shown here is the superposition of the central domain with the armadillo repeats of the anaphase-promoting complex (PDB code 3NMW). h, The armadillo-like repeats in the NTD, handle and central domains are joined end-to-end to form a superhelical assembly. The appearance of the superhelical assembly resembles a question mark. i, Each central domain directly interacts with two adjacent NTDs. The convex side of the helical repeats is involved in binding to the NTDs. Two close-up views are shown to highlight key residues that may form hydrogen bonds at the interfaces. j, The NTDs, central, handle and helical domains form multiple interfaces. Shown here are two adjacent NTDs (NTD and NTD\u2032), one central domain, one handle domain, and the N-terminal fragment of the helical domain. k, SPRY2 bridges the spatial gap between the handle domain and HD2 from the adjacent protomer. l, FKBP12 is bound in a cleft formed by the handle, NTD and SPRY1/3 domains. m, An extended hydrophobic loop from the handle domain reaches into the ligand-binding pocket of FKBP12. A close-up view is shown to illustrate the residues that may mediate the interactions. Extended Data Fig. 7: Alignment of the channel domain sequences of RyR orthologues. Secondary structural elements are indicated above the sequence alignment. Invariant amino acids are shaded in grey. The residues that may constitute potential cation-binding sites are in red.

The colour code is annotated at the bottom. CCD, central core disease; CPVT1, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia type 1; CRD, core/rod disease; MHS, malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. Extended Data Fig. 8: Structural comparison of the RyR1 channel domain with representative tetrameric cation channels of known structures. a, Structural comparison of the pore-forming elements from different tetrameric cation channels of known structures. Two diagonal protomers are shown. In all structures, the S5 and S6 segments are coloured grey. In the structures of CavAb and KcsA, the bound ions are shown as spheres. PDB codes: 4MS2 for CavAb, 3J5Q for TRPV1 and 1K4C for KcsA. b, Structural comparison of the transmembrane region of RyR1 VSL to the VSDs or like domains in the indicated tetrameric ion channels. Note that a hydrophilic sequence between S1 and S2 (residues 4579\u20134639) exhibits poor electron microscopy density and constitutes the least conserved DR1 region (DR for \u2018divergent\u2019) in the RyR1 channel domain11 (Extended Data Fig. 7). The ordered segments within this sequence form a pair of short anti-parallel β-strands that extends into the sarcoplasmic reticulum lumen.

See Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 1 for details of the mutations. Extended Data Fig. 10: Intra- and inter-domain interactions that may be important for the long-range allosteric regulation of channel gating. a, Extensive van der Waals interactions exist between the pore-forming segments, and between the VSL of one protomer and S6 of adjacent protomer. These extensive interactions may aid the coupling of conformational changes within the channel domain. One protomer is colour-coded, whereas the adjacent one is coloured silver. b, A stereo view of the polar interaction network between the central domain and CTD. Potential H-bonds are shown as red dashed lines. c, The van der Waals contacts between the U-motif of the central domain and the CTD.

        "text": "Controlling domain wall (DW) generation and dynamics behaviour in ferromagnetic nanowire is critical to the engineering of domain wall-based non-volatile logic and magnetic memory devices. Previous research showed that DW generation suffered from a random or stochastic nature and that makes the realization of DW based device a challenging task. Conventionally, stabilizing a Néel DW requires a long pulsed current and the assistance of an external magnetic field. Here, we demonstrate a method to deterministically produce single DW without having to compromise the pulse duration. No external field is required to stabilize the DW. This is achieved by controlling the stray field magnetostatic interaction between a current-carrying strip line generated DW and the edge of the nanowire. The natural edge-field assisted domain wall generation process was found to be twice as fast as the conventional methods and requires less current density. Such deterministic DW generation method could potentially bring DW device technology, a step closer to on-chip application.
