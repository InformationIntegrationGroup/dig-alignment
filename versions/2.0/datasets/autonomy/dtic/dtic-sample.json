  "abstract": "Final report on vision-sensor support for the DARPA Autonomous Land Vehicle (ALV) program. ERIM fabricated three laser-ranging sensors (0.82 micron) for the program and one active multispectral ranging (MS) sensor. This report describes the sensors and support provided to the ALV contractors receiving the sensors during the period July 1984 through August 1987. The MS sensor was given only limited laboratory testing and never adapted to the autonomous vehicle. The report also discusses on-going research related to diode-pumped lasers. Keywords: Laser radar; Vision sensors; 3-D sensor; Active sensor; Multispectral sensor; Autonomous land vehicle; ALV.",
