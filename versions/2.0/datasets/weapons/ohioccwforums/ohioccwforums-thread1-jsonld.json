"text": "Buyer asks: Is this your gun to sell? Are you an Ohio resident, may I see you Ohio DL or ID? Optional: Do you have a Ohio CHL? Seller asks: Are you an Ohio resident, may I see you Ohio DL or ID? How are you paying? Is there anything that legally bars you from buying or owning a firearm? Optional: Do you have a Ohio CHL? The above is the minimum. You can ask or demand further documentation or exchange of info, but I no longer do. My preference to actually conduct the transaction is a secluded spot in a public space (ex: away from other vehicles in a Wally World or shopping plaza parking lot, a large restaurant parking lot, Gander Mountain lot, or gun club). Or, @ a gun show. I also keep the firearm in the seller's vehicle away from the casual observer. When the exchange is made, try to keep the firearm covered or cased for transfer to your vehicle just to avoid unnecessary public observation/ 'man with a gun' call. If the seller is a total stranger, I ask to do a quick inspection or function test. If you don't know a particular weapons break down or function test, ask the seller. Most will be happy to show you.

"text": "I am thinking about buying a handgun from someone else (that I do not know) here in Ohio. I know private party transaction from one Ohio resident to another is legal but what is the best and safest way to conduct such a transaction. I am the buyer in this case but either way what information should exchange hands (in addition to the exchange of money and firearm) so that both side of the transaction have enough information to assure them the other party member is on the up-and-up. I have never done a private party sale with someone I did not know. Any advice and experience would be greatly appriciated. Is there any issues or pitfalls I should watch for and avoid. Thanks mcb [I made this a sticky in the For Sale / Trades / Wanted forum, and left a shadow topic in Ohio Issues and Politics - JK]",

"text": "If something doesn't feel right about a buyer or seller, feel free to walk away. Better to not buy that gun, than to get ripped off or worse. Another possible touchy subject is the presence of other persons at a sale. No one likes to feel outnumbered when guns and money are changing hands. I usually do not mind if the other party brings a wife/friend/etc. However, do remember that if you bring a 'guest' and the buyer/seller comes alone, it is probably best to have your friend wait some distance away. If I've met someone before I really don't care if they bring the President with them, but if I don't know the buyer/seller from Adam that gets my attention. Always go armed, and assume the other party is armed also. An armed society is a polite society. Not one of the  'more-equal animals' . Hippies make me laugh. Bleeding hippies make me laugh REALLY HARD! -Morne",

"text": "For CR don't you only have to enter it into your book if you acquired it via your CR? For instance, if I bought an SKS from a gun dealer and filled out a yellow form, do I still need to enter it into my bound book? Anyway, for a private sale I prefer to hand them the money and receive my weapon. I bought a gun from a guy at a flea market, I have no idea who he was, he had no idea who I was. He said a price, I gave him the money, he gave me my gun. He was selling guns and puppies. They sure looked cute (of course I am referring to the guns). The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. - Thomas Jefferson Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death! - Patrick Henry",
