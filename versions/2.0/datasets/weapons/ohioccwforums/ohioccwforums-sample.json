      "content": "I am thinking about buying a handgun from someone else (that I do not know) here in Ohio. I know private party transaction from one Ohio resident to another is legal but what is the best and safest way to conduct such a transaction. I am the buyer in this case but either way what information should exchange hands (in addition to the exchange of money and firearm) so that both side of the transaction have enough information to assure them the other party member is on the up-and-up. I have never done a private party sale with someone I did not know. Any advice and experience would be greatly appriciated. Is there any issues or pitfalls I should watch for and avoid. Thanks mcb [I made this a sticky in the For Sale / Trades / Wanted forum, and left a shadow topic in &quot;Ohio Issues and Politics&quot; - JK]",

The law references the actions that a licensee must take; it doesn't (ever) discuss &quot;using your license&quot; to acquire something. If you're currently licensed, you must record the transaction, and with enough detail to satisfy the law's requirements. If you're not licensed, shred your old bound book and don't bother building a new one. -- Someone edited my signature and deleted my posts, and all I got was... this edited signature.",

Seller asks: Are you an Ohio resident, may I see you Ohio DL or ID? How are you paying? Is there anything that legally bars you from buying or owning a firearm? Optional: Do you have a Ohio CHL? The above is the minimum. You can ask or demand further documentation or exchange of info, but I no longer do. My preference to actually conduct the transaction is a secluded spot in a public space (ex: away from other vehicles in a Wally World or shopping plaza parking lot, a large restaurant parking lot, Gander Mountain lot, or gun club). Or, @ a gun show. I also keep the firearm in the seller's vehicle away from the casual observer. When the exchange is made, try to keep the firearm covered or cased for transfer to your vehicle just to avoid unnecessary public observation/ 'man with a gun' call. If the seller is a total stranger, I ask to do a quick inspection or function test. If you don't know a particular weapons break down or function test, ask the seller. Most will be happy to show you.

Another possible touchy subject is the presence of other persons at a sale. No one likes to feel outnumbered when guns and money are changing hands. I usually do not mind if the other party brings a wife/friend/etc. However, do remember that if you bring a 'guest' and the buyer/seller comes alone, it is probably best to have your friend wait some distance away. If I've met someone before I really don't care if they bring the President with them, but if I don't know the buyer/seller from Adam that gets my attention.

Showed he was an Ohio resident, and (at some point) had passed a background check. Due dilligence done. Second time, with the ammo, just changed hands and chatted for a while. No ID. Haven't yet had the opportunity to buy anything in a FTF transaction, so I can't comment on what a seller has had me do. I think just do what any prudent person would do to ensure that you aren't selling a felon a gun, and everyone is good. Seriously, you can't be expected to run a full background check somehow, right? Although then again, with Ohio's convoluted gun laws... My head hurts now.",
