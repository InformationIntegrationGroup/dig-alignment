Right now I have made some 12 ga shotshells with 7.5 and 9 shot using trailboss powder. Our of my single shot shotgun recoil is hardly anything and at 30 yards I am smoking clay targets sitting on a back stop. I am going to work up some more shot loads with larger shot and maybe some buckshot.    What is still in concept is filling proper size tube with hotmelt glue for a solid 37 mm \"bullet\"  Make some wads using cardboard tubes for a 37mm shot shell  Use rubber balls for non leathel use for pest using above homemade wad.  Use cardboard tube for light primer powered projectiles for backyard fun.    This is just a few that I am thinking of making.    I am really hoping the light 12 ga works as well out of the 37 mm as it did with the shotgun. If it does I want to mount it to my ar15 in 22 long rifle so I can use for small game hunting. 22 lr on top large shotshell under.",
