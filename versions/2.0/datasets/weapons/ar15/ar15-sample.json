      "content": "I have several in mind to try in it but will not put any together until I get the stamp. <br />I am going to order a 12 ga shotshell adaptor for starters. <br />Right now I have made some 12 ga shotshells with 7.5 and 9 shot using trailboss powder. Our of my single shot shotgun recoil is hardly anything and at 30 yards I am smoking clay targets sitting on a back stop. I am going to work up some more shot loads with larger shot and maybe some buckshot. <br /> <br />What is still in concept is filling proper size tube with hotmelt glue for a solid 37 mm \"bullet\" <br />Make some wads using cardboard tubes for a 37mm shot shell <br />Use rubber balls for non leathel use for pest using above homemade wad. <br />Use cardboard tube for light primer powered projectiles for backyard fun. <br /> <br />This is just a few that I am thinking of making. <br /> <br />I am really hoping the light 12 ga works as well out of the 37 mm as it did with the shotgun. If it does I want to mount it to my ar15 in 22 long rifle so I can use for small game hunting. 22 lr on top large shotshell under. <br /></div>",
