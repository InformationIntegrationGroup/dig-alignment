Most likely that &quot;misprint&quot; was someone listing it at their price. The pricing markup on things would surprise a lot of people. If they are losing money it's probably not much. Second, the company chose to honor it...he has every right to ask for it at that price since they sent him an order confirmation. I spoke with an agent when I placed my order on Friday who assured me the price was right and they were getting them back in stock. Things changed this weekend...probably when they realized the huge demand. Don't blame Quake for wanting a company to honor their agreement. He didn't know it was a pricing error when he sent the order and they are choosing to honor it. From what I've seen on here he is a good guy. Let's not be so quick to jump on him.",

No flame suit necessary, and no ethical issues that I can see. They advertised a price and I placed an order for a single unit at that sale price; I'm not trying to take some kind of unfair advantage of their mistake. I asked them if they'd honor the sale at that price, and they said they would; I appreciate that, but it's not as though I can force them into it. If someone (either us, or a newspaper, etc) makes a mistake on an ad, a person asks if I'll honor it and I choose to do so, does that make the purchaser unethical? I personally don't think so. Read my posts - nowhere did I say they 'had to', 'must', or even 'should' honor that price, and it's not like I threatened to sue them or never do business with them again if they chose not to. I said that I &quot;seriously hope&quot; they do. To be fair, I did say that I wish I'd ordered more than one, but again, they have the option of whether or not to ship them out at that price. I'm sure they have a standard &quot;not responsible for misprints&quot; disclaimer as most vendors do, and they absolutely have the option of invoking that at any time; still do for that matter. This isn't (imo, anyway) someone taking advantage of some little old lady on a used car that's actually a collector's item. They buy &amp; sell these for a living, they know what they pay for them, and they agreed to a price, a price that they had (and still have) the option of taking or not taking. Free market, free choice; they (or I), can cancel the transaction at will.",

We keep the keys here in our secured facility as a courtesy for our customers (without charge mind you), so their termite people &amp; such can come by and check them in and out as needed. My point is simply this - with all that opportunity to go &quot;parasite&quot; if I wanted to, it's my integrity that all those people count on most of all. And my integrity is obviously not for sale for the price of a pair of binoculars; if it could be had that cheap, there'd be a lot of cleaned-out lake homes around here. So again, &quot;See response to sebecman above.&quot; And I really must say &quot;thank you&quot; for immediately jumping to accusational pontifications. Well done young man; you really don't know anything about me.",

To stay on topic, Palmetto State Armory has FGGM .308 for $20.95/20. the older 7.62 version is 19.95/20. this doesnt appear to even be a sale but most everywhere else i see it, it runs 35-40/box.",
